[INFO] Generating Zero-Shot response.
The most likely underlying etiology of this patient's hypertension is (A) Aldosterone excess. The patient presents with hypokalemia (low potassium level of 3.3 mEq/L) and metabolic alkalosis (elevated bicarbonate level of 33 mEq/L), which are consistent with primary hyperaldosteronism (Conn's syndrome). This condition leads to increased sodium retention, potassium excretion, and hypertension.
