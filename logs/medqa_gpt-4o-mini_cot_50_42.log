Question: Two days after being admitted for pneumonia, a 70-year-old man has repeated episodes of palpitations and nausea. He does not feel lightheaded and does not have chest pain. The patient appears mildly distressed. His pulse is 59/min and blood pressure is 110/60 mm Hg. Examination shows no abnormalities. Sputum cultures taken at the time of admission were positive for Mycoplasma pneumoniae. His magnesium is 2.0 mEq/L and his potassium is 3.7 mEq/L. An ECG taken during an episode of palpitations is shown. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? (A) Administration of metoprolol (D) Intermittent transvenous overdrive pacing (B) Administration of magnesium sulfate (C) Administration of amiodarone (E) Adminstration of potassium chloride
Reason: The answer is (B) Administration of magnesium sulfate because the patient's symptoms may be indicative of a magnesium deficiency, particularly given that his magnesium level is on the lower end of the normal range (2.0 mEq/L) and he is experiencing palpitations. Hypomagnesemia can lead to various cardiac arrhythmias, so correcting the magnesium level could help alleviate his symptoms and prevent further complications.
Answer: (B) Administration of magnesium sulfate

Question: A 39-year-old male is rushed to the emergency department after he developed a sudden-onset severe headache with ensuing nausea, vomiting, vision changes, and loss of consciousness. Past medical history is unattainable. He reports that the headache is worse than any he has experienced before. Noncontrast CT of the head is significant for an intracranial hemorrhage. Follow-up cerebral angiography is performed and shows a ruptured anterior communicating artery aneurysm. Which of the following has the strongest association with this patient's current presentation? (A) History of multiple hemangioblastomas of the retina and spine as well as pheochromocytoma (E) History of renal transplantation at 8 years of age (D) Kidney ultrasound showing numerous bilateral renal cysts (C) Abdominal CT suggestive of renal cell carcinoma (B) Brain MRI showing a butterfly glioma with a central necrotic core
Reason: The answer is (D) Kidney ultrasound showing numerous bilateral renal cysts because this finding is highly indicative of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), which is associated with an increased risk of intracranial aneurysms. Patients with ADPKD often develop aneurysms, especially in the anterior circulation, which correlates with this patient's presentation of a ruptured anterior communicating artery aneurysm.
Answer: (D) Kidney ultrasound showing numerous bilateral renal cysts

Question: A 32-year-old G1P0 woman at 27 weeks estimated gestational age presents for her first prenatal care appointment. She recently immigrated to the United States and didn’t receive any prenatal care in her country. Her blood pressure is 130/70 mm Hg, pulse is 85/min, and respirations are 16/min. Her BMI is 38.3 kg/m2. Physical examination is unremarkable except for normal pregnancy changes. Fetal ultrasound is performed and reveals fetal macrosomia. Which one of the following diagnostic tests is most likely to reveal the cause of this fetal abnormality? (A) Serum insulin (B) C-peptide (C) Oral glucose tolerance test (D) Glycated hemoglobin (E) Leptin
Reason: The answer is (C) Oral glucose tolerance test because fetal macrosomia can often be attributed to maternal gestational diabetes, which is characterized by elevated blood glucose levels during pregnancy. The oral glucose tolerance test is a standard diagnostic tool used to identify gestational diabetes, making it the most relevant test to determine if this is the underlying cause of the fetal macrosomia observed in the patient.
Answer: (C) Oral glucose tolerance test

Question: A 54-year-old man comes to the physician for a health maintenance examination. He feels well. He is 173 cm (5 ft 8 in) tall and weighs 84 kg (185 lb); BMI is 28 kg/m2. His vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Serum lipid studies show:
Total cholesterol 280 mg/dL
HDL-cholesterol 30 mg/dL
LDL-cholesterol 195 mg/dL
Triglycerides 275 mg/dL
Treatment with atorvastatin and cholestyramine is initiated. Which of the following changes is most likely induced by both agents?" (A) Increased lipoprotein lipase activity (B) Increased LDL receptor expression (E) Increased cholesterol levels in hepatocytes (C) Increased hepatic bile salt synthesis (D) Decreased hepatic de novo cholesterol synthesis
Reason: The answer is (B) Increased LDL receptor expression because atorvastatin, a statin, works by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase, which decreases cholesterol synthesis in the liver. This reduction in cholesterol leads to an upregulation of LDL receptors as the body attempts to increase the uptake of LDL particles from the bloodstream to maintain cellular cholesterol levels. Additionally, cholestyramine, a bile acid sequestrant, also prompts the liver to increase LDL receptor expression to compensate for the decreased bile acid reabsorption and subsequent cholesterol depletion.
Answer: (B) Increased LDL receptor expression

Question: A 41-year-old woman arrives to her primary care physician with abnormal labs. She states that 1 week ago she had laboratory work done as part of her company’s health initiative. During the past month, she has been walking 3 miles a day and has increased the amount of fruits and vegetables in her diet. Her medical history is significant for obesity, hypertension, and obstructive sleep apnea. She takes hydrochlorothiazide and wears a continuous positive airway pressure machine at night. Her recent labs are shown below:

Serum:
Na+: 140 mEq/L
K+: 4.1 mEq/L
Cl-: 101 mEq/L
BUN: 16 mg/dL
Glucose: 95 mg/dL
Creatinine: 0.9 mg/dL

Total cholesterol: 255 mg/dL (normal < 200 mg/dL)
Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol: 115 mg/dL (normal < 100 mg/dL)
High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol: 40 (normal > 50 mg/dL)
Triglycerides: 163 mg/dL (normal < 150 mg/dL)

The patient is started on atorvastatin. Which of the following is the most common adverse effect of the patient’s new medication? (B) Elevated liver enzymes (C) Flushing (D) Lactic acidosis (A) Cholesterol gallstones (E) Rhabdomyolysis
Reason: The answer is (B) Elevated liver enzymes because atorvastatin, like other statins, is commonly associated with liver-related side effects, including mild elevations in liver enzymes (such as AST and ALT). While more serious adverse effects can occur with statin use, such as rhabdomyolysis, elevated liver enzymes are a more common and frequently monitored side effect when patients are started on these medications.
Answer: (B) Elevated liver enzymes

Question: A 17-year-old girl is brought in by her mother due to rapid weight loss over the past month. The patient says she has been having episodes of diarrhea, which she attributes to laxatives she takes regularly to keep her weight down. She also says she has not had her period yet. The patient’s mother adds that the patient has been underperforming at school and acting very strangely at home. Her current BMI is 16.8 kg/m2. On physical examination, the skin on her limbs and around her neck is inflamed and erythematous. Her tongue is bright red and smooth. She states that over the last 2 weeks, she has been eating nothing but small portions of fruit. She is diagnosed with a vitamin deficiency. Which of the following statements is true about the vitamin most likely deficient in this patient? (C) It is used to treat hypertension (E) It increases the GI absorption of iron (A) It is derived from tyrosine (D) Synthesis requires vitamin B2 and B6 (B) Synthesis requires vitamin B1 and B6
Reason: The answer is (D) Synthesis requires vitamin B2 and B6 because the patient's presentation suggests a deficiency in niacin (vitamin B3), which can occur due to a very limited diet, as seen in her significant weight loss and restrictive eating habits. Niacin synthesis from tryptophan in the body requires both vitamin B2 (riboflavin) and vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) as cofactors, making option D the correct statement regarding niacin synthesis in the context of this patient's vitamin deficiency.
Answer: (D) Synthesis requires vitamin B2 and B6

Question: A 74-year-old gentleman presents to his family practitioner with the complaint of an inability to open his left eye since this morning. He also complains of intermittent pain and numbness in his left arm that has been present for the last few days. He denies ocular pain, difficulty swallowing, fatigability, or diplopia. His symptoms remain constant without fluctuation. He has a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia. Further history reveals that he has lost 5.4 kg (12 lb) of weight in the past 4 months. He is a chronic smoker with a 72 pack-year smoking history. His blood pressure is 142/76 mm Hg, the heart rate is 76/min, the respiratory rate is 12/min, the temperature is 36.8°C (98.4°F), and BMI is the 18.2 kg/m2. The patient is awake, alert, and oriented to person, place, and time. He has partial drooping of the left eyelid while the right eyelid appears normal. The left pupil is 1 mm and the right pupil is 3 mm in diameter. Extraocular muscle movements are normal. What additional clinical feature would most likely be present in this patient? (A) Facial asymmetry (D) Tongue deviation to the left side (E) Urinary retention (C) Loss of hemifacial sweating (B) Ipsilateral loss of touch sensations on the face
Reason: The answer is (C) Loss of hemifacial sweating because the symptoms described in this patient are consistent with a left-sided Horner's syndrome. The inability to open the left eye (ptosis) and the smaller left pupil (miosis) suggest involvement of the sympathetic nerves, which can also cause loss of sweat on the affected side of the face. Additionally, the patient's smoking history and weight loss raise concerns for possible underlying malignancy, such as a Pancoast tumor, which can cause Horner’s syndrome due to invasion of sympathetic nerve structures.
Answer: (C) Loss of hemifacial sweating

Question: A 10-year-old girl is brought to the neurologist for management of recently diagnosed seizures. Based on her clinical presentation, the neurologist decides to start a medication that works by blocking thalamic T-type calcium channels. Her parents are cautioned that the medication has a number of side effects including itching, headache, and GI distress. Specifically, they are warned to stop the medication immediately and seek medical attention if they notice skin bullae or sloughing. Which of the following conditions is most likely being treated in this patient? (C) Simple seizures (A) Absence seizures (E) Tonic-clonic seizures (D) Status epilepticus (B) Complex seizures
Reason: The answer is (A) Absence seizures because the medication described, which blocks thalamic T-type calcium channels, is typically used to treat this type of seizure. Absence seizures are characterized by brief lapses in consciousness and commonly respond to medications that target these specific calcium channels in the thalamus. The specified side effects, including potential severe skin reactions, align with the profile of ethosuximide, a standard treatment for absence seizures.

Let's analyze the information step by step.

1. **Patient Profile**: The patient is a 56-year-old man with a history of hypertension, presenting with progressive fatigue and muscle cramps. He is on hydrochlorothiazide, which is a diuretic, and has new onset muscle cramps, which can be indicative of electrolyte imbalances.

2. **Laboratory Values**:
   - Sodium (Na+): 138 mEq/L (normal)
   - Chloride (Cl-): 100 mEq/L (normal)
   - Potassium (K+): 3.3 mEq/L (low, indicating hypokalemia)
   - Bicarbonate (HCO3-): 33 mEq/L (elevated, indicating metabolic alkalosis)
   - BUN: 20 mg/dL (slightly elevated)
   - Glucose: 129 mg/dL (elevated, indicating possible glucose intolerance or diabetes)

3. **Interpretation of Findings**:
   - The patient has hypokalemia (low potassium) and metabolic alkalosis (high bicarbonate). These findings are often associated with conditions that cause excess aldosterone, such as primary hyperaldosteronism (Conn's syndrome).
   - Hydrochlorothiazide can cause hypokalemia, but the degree of hypokalemia and the metabolic alkalosis suggest that there may be an underlying condition causing excess aldosterone production.

4. **Options Analysis**:
   - (B) Catecholamine-secreting mass: This would typically cause episodic hypertension and not necessarily hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis.
   - (C) Cortisol excess: This could cause hypertension (Cushing's syndrome) but would typically not present with hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis.
   - (D) Impaired kidney perfusion: This could lead to secondary hypertension but would not typically cause hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis.
   - (A) Aldosterone excess: This is consistent with the findings of hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis, suggesting primary hyperaldosteronism.
   - (E) Increased peripheral vascular resistance: This is a common cause of hypertension but does not explain the electrolyte abnormalities.

Given the analysis, the most likely underlying etiology of this patient's hypertension is:

**Answer: (A) Aldosterone excess**

Administration of which of the following agents would increase this patient’s risk for mercaptopurine toxicity? (D) Allopurinol (C) Mesna (A) Leucovorin (B) Dexrazoxane (E) Amifostine
Reason: Administration of allopurinol (D) would increase this patient's risk for mercaptopurine toxicity. This is because allopurinol inhibits xanthine oxidase, an enzyme that is responsible for the metabolism of mercaptopurine, leading to increased levels and potential toxicity of the drug. Since mercaptopurine is primarily metabolized through this pathway, the concomitant use of allopurinol can significantly heighten its effects and side effects.
Answer: (D) Allopurinol

Which of the following is the best next step in management? (D) Iron supplementation (E) Vitamin D supplementation (B) Counseling for alcohol cessation (C) Exercise regimen and weight loss (A) Colonoscopy
Reason: The best next step in management is a colonoscopy (A). This recommendation is based on the patient's presentation of microcytic anemia (low hemoglobin and hematocrit coupled with low mean corpuscular volume), which raises concern for gastrointestinal bleeding, potentially due to colorectal cancer or another source of blood loss. Given the patient's age and the concerning symptoms of recent weight loss and fatigue, it is crucial to rule out serious underlying conditions through colonoscopy.

Question: A 10-year-old girl presents to your office with a fever and rash. Her mother first noticed the rash 2 days ago after a camping trip. The rash began on her wrists and ankles and has now spread to her palms and the soles of her feet. This morning, she was feeling unwell and complaining of a headache. She had a fever of 102°F (39°C) prompting her mother to bring her to your office. She is otherwise healthy and does not take any medications. Her medical history is significant for a broken arm at age 8. On physical exam her blood pressure is 120/80 mmHg, pulse is 110/min, and respirations are 22/min. You notice a petechial rash on the palms, soles, ankles, and wrists. Which of the following findings would confirm the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms? (A) Granulocytes with morulae in the cytoplasm (D) Positive fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test (FTA-ABS) (B) Cross-reactivity of serum with proteus antigens (C) Monocytes with morulae in the cytoplasm (E) Positive Borrelia burgdorferi antibodies
Reason: The finding that would confirm the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is cross-reactivity of serum with proteus antigens (B). This presentation suggests a possible diagnosis of Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF), which is a tick-borne illness caused by Rickettsia rickettsii. The classic petechial rash on the palms and soles, along with fever and headache, is characteristic of RMSF, and the cross-reactivity with proteus antigens can be observed in serologic tests for rickettsial infections, supporting this diagnosis.
Answer: (B) Cross-reactivity of serum with proteus antigens

Question: A 65-year-old man is brought to his primary care provider by his concerned wife. She reports he has had this "thing" on his eye for years and refuses to seek care. He denies any pain or discharge from the affected eye. A picture of his eye is shown below. Given the diagnosis, what are you most likely to discover when taking this patient's history? (D) He was involved in a bar fight and experienced a ruptured globe 10 years ago (B) He suffered from recurrent conjunctivitis in his youth (A) He experienced shingles three years ago, with a positive Hutchinson's sign (C) He grew up in Ecuador, where he worked outdoors as a farmer for 30 years (E) He suffered a burn to his eye while cleaning his bathroom with bleach 5 years earlier
Reason: The answer is (C) He grew up in Ecuador, where he worked outdoors as a farmer for 30 years. 

This option is most likely to have relevance to the patient's eye condition because prolonged outdoor exposure in farming can increase the risk of developing certain ocular conditions such as pterygium, which is commonly seen in individuals who are frequently exposed to UV light and dust. His history of outdoor farming in Ecuador suggests significant exposure to these risk factors, making this the most plausible background for the observed eye issue.
Answer: (C) He grew up in Ecuador, where he worked outdoors as a farmer for 30 years

Question: A 53-year-old woman with hypertension and hyperlipidemia comes to the physician because of generalized reddening of her skin and itching for the past 2 weeks. Her symptoms occur every evening before bedtime and last for about 30 minutes. Three months ago, atorvastatin was stopped after she experienced progressively worsening neck and back pain. Statin therapy was reinitiated at lower doses 3 weeks ago but had to be stopped again after her musculoskeletal symptoms recurred. Her menses occur irregularly at 2–3 month intervals and last for 3–4 days. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for the past 30 years. Her current medications include lisinopril and niacin. Her brother died of colonic adenocarcinoma, and her father died of small cell lung cancer. She is 169 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 83 kg (183 lb); BMI is 29 kg/m2. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Serum lipid studies show:
Total cholesterol 247 mg/dL
HDL-cholesterol 39 mg/dL
LDL-cholesterol 172 mg/dL
Triglycerides 152 mg/dL
Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?" (D) Switch lisinopril to hydrochlorothiazide (C) Measure urine metanephrine levels (E) Switch niacin to fenofibrate (A) Administer ibuprofen (B) Measure urine hydroxyindoleacetic acid levels
Reason: The answer is (A) Administer ibuprofen. 

Ibuprofen can help alleviate the generalized skin reddening and itching that the patient is experiencing, as it is an anti-inflammatory and may provide symptomatic relief. Given that her symptoms occur in the evening and are related to discomfort possibly associated with musculoskeletal issues from previous statin use, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) like ibuprofen is a reasonable choice for management while further evaluating her overall treatment plan.
Answer: (A) Administer ibuprofen

Question: A 80-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department from a senior living home with a chief complaint of acute onset and severe abdominal pain with 5 episodes of bloody diarrhea. She has a history of having chronic constipation, and postprandial abdominal pain which subsides after taking nitroglycerin. The abdominal pain that she is currently experiencing did not subside using her medication. A week ago, she had a percutaneous intervention for an inferior wall STEMI. On physical examination, the patient looks pale and confused. The vital signs include: blood pressure 80/40 mm Hg, heart rate 108/min, respiratory rate 22/min, and temperature 35.6°C (96.0°F). The patient receives an aggressive treatment consisting of intravenous fluids and vasopressors, and she is transferred to the ICU. Despite all the necessary interventions, the patient dies. During the autopsy, a dark hemorrhagic appearance of the sigmoid colon is noted. What is the most likely pathology related to her death? (C) Twisting of sigmoid colon around its mesentery (A) Transmural infarction (B) Mucosal infarct (E) Adenocarcinoma (D) Toxic megacolon
Reason: The answer is (A) Transmural infarction. 

In this case, the patient's acute onset of severe abdominal pain, episodes of bloody diarrhea, and her history of an inferior wall STEMI suggest a possible mesenteric ischemia due to reduced blood flow. The dark hemorrhagic appearance of the sigmoid colon observed in the autopsy is indicative of significant ischemic damage, which is characteristic of transmural infarction, where the entire thickness of the bowel wall is involved, leading to necrosis and potentially contributing to her rapid deterioration and death.
Answer: (A) Transmural infarction

Question: A 32-year-old female presents with acute onset abdominal pain accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and hematuria. She is currently taking glipizide for type 2 diabetes mellitus. Past medical history is also significant for lactose intolerance. She has just started training for a marathon, and she drinks large amounts of sports drinks to replenish her electrolytes and eats a high-protein diet to assist in muscle recovery. She admits to using laxatives sporadically to help her manage her weight. On physical exam, the patient appears distressed and has difficulty getting comfortable. Her temperature is 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate is 103/min, respiratory rate is 15/min, blood pressure is 105/85 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation is 100% on room air. Her BMI is 21 kg/m2. CBC, CMP, and urinalysis are ordered. Renal ultrasound demonstrates an obstruction at the ureteropelvic junction (see image). Which of the following would most likely be seen in this patient? (A) Edema and anuria  (D) Rebound tenderness, pain exacerbated by coughing (E) Positional urinary retention (B) Flank pain that does not radiate to the groin (C) Colicky pain radiating to the groin
Reason: The answer is (B) Flank pain that does not radiate to the groin. 

Given the patient's obstruction at the ureteropelvic junction, it is common for patients to experience flank pain due to the increased pressure and stretching of the renal capsule. Unlike colicky pain that radiates to the groin, which is typically associated with ureteral stones, flank pain from a ureteropelvic junction obstruction may be more localized to the flank area and less likely to radiate, making this the most likely presentation in this scenario.
Answer: (B) Flank pain that does not radiate to the groin

Question: A 49-year-old man seeks evaluation at an urgent care clinic with a complaint of palpitations for the past few hours. He denies any chest pain, shortness of breath, or sweating. He is anxious and appears worried. His medical history is unremarkable with the exception of mild bronchial asthma. He only uses medications during an asthma attack and has not used medications since last week. He is a former smoker and drinks a couple of beers on weekends. His heart rate is 146/min, respiratory rate is 16/min, temperature is 37.6°C (99.68°F), and blood pressure is 120/80 mm Hg. The physical examination is unremarkable, and an electrocardiogram is ordered. Which of the following groups of drugs should be given to treat his symptoms? (C) Non-selective β-receptor antagonist (A) α1-receptor antagonist (B) Selective β1-receptor antagonist (E) β-receptor agonist (D) α-receptor agonist
Reason: The answer is (B) Selective β1-receptor antagonist. 

In this case, the patient is experiencing palpitations, which suggests a rapid heart rate potentially due to anxiety or another form of tachycardia. A selective β1-receptor antagonist would help to reduce the heart rate specifically without significantly affecting the bronchial smooth muscle, making it a suitable choice for this patient who has a history of asthma. This class of medication can effectively alleviate the symptoms of palpitations while minimizing the risk of bronchoconstriction associated with non-selective beta-blockers.
Answer: (B) Selective β1-receptor antagonist

Question: A 48-year-old woman with alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency undergoes a lung transplant. She tolerates the surgery well, but 3 years later develops inflammation and fibrosis in her terminal bronchioles. Which of the following best describes the pathophysiology of this patient's deterioration? (B) Cytotoxic T lymphocytes reacting against foreign MHCs (D) T-cell mediated vascular damage (A) Staphylocuccus aureus pneumonia (C) Lymphocytic inflammation of the bronchiolar wall (E) Proliferation of grafted immunocompetent T cells
Reason: The answer is (C) Lymphocytic inflammation of the bronchiolar wall. 

In this case, the patient has developed inflammation and fibrosis in the terminal bronchioles after a lung transplant, which is typically indicative of a form of chronic rejection known as bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS). This condition involves lymphocytic infiltration and inflammation of the bronchiolar walls, leading to obstruction and fibrosis, as the body’s immune system attempts to reject the transplanted tissue. Hence, the pathophysiology of the patient's deterioration is characterized by this lymphocytic inflammation.
Answer: (C) Lymphocytic inflammation of the bronchiolar wall

Question: A 17-year-old girl makes an appointment with her pediatrician because she is concerned that she may have gotten a sexually transmitted infection. Specifically, she had unprotected sex two weeks ago and has since been experiencing painful urination and abdominal pain. Laboratory tests confirm a diagnosis of Chlamydial infection. At this point, the girl says that she wants to personally give permission to be treated rather than seek consent from her parents because they do not know that she is in a relationship. She also asks that the diagnosis not be reported to anyone. What should the physician do with regards to these two patient requests? (E) Do not contact her parents but do report to public health agencies (C) Contact her parents but do not report to public health agencies (B) Contact her parents as well as report to public health agencies (D) Do not contact her parents and do not report to public health agencies (A) Choose based on the physician's interpretation of the patient's best interests
Reason: The answer is (E) Do not contact her parents but do report to public health agencies. 

In this situation, the patient is a minor who has the right to seek treatment for sexually transmitted infections without parental consent in many jurisdictions, particularly when it comes to reproductive health issues. However, the physician is also mandated to report certain STIs to public health agencies to monitor and control the spread of infections in the community, consistent with public health laws. Therefore, while respecting the patient's wishes for confidentiality from her parents, the physician must still comply with reporting requirements to the appropriate public health authorities.

Question: A 62-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes mellitus comes to the physician because of a 1-year history of progressively worsening paresthesias in her upper limbs. She has accidentally burned her fingers on hot dishes several times. She was involved in a motor vehicle collision 3 years ago. Neurologic examination shows absent temperature sensation with normal fine touch sensation over the upper extremities and chest. Without treatment, this patient is at increased risk of developing which of the following? (C) Absent anal wink reflex (E) Absent knee-jerk reflex (A) Exaggerated biceps reflex (D) Drooping of the eyelid (B) Decreased Mini-Mental State Examination score
Reason: The answer is (D) Drooping of the eyelid. 

The patient's symptoms, particularly the absent temperature sensation with preserved fine touch and the history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, suggest a peripheral neuropathy, which is common in diabetic patients. The involvement of the upper limbs and the mention of a motor vehicle collision may indicate nerve damage that can affect other areas, including the eyes. A drooping eyelid (ptosis) can occur if there's involvement of the sympathetic pathway, potentially indicating Horner's syndrome or another neuropathic condition affecting the ocular muscles. Therefore, without treatment, this patient is at increased risk for such complications.
Answer: (D) Drooping of the eyelid

Let's analyze the situation step by step.

The patient has developed a postoperative infection characterized by fever, purulent discharge, and the presence of gram-positive cocci in clusters. The organism is likely Staphylococcus aureus, which is known to cause such infections. The treatment with oral dicloxacillin, a penicillinase-resistant penicillin, is appropriate for treating infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus.

However, the patient continues to have high-grade fever and purulent discharge despite this treatment, indicating that the antibiotic is not effective against the organism. 

Now, let's evaluate the options:

(A) **Secretion of a pyrogenic toxin** - While some bacteria can secrete toxins that cause fever, this does not explain the failure of the antibiotic treatment.

(B) **Presence of an impenetrable outer membrane** - This is characteristic of gram-negative bacteria, not gram-positive cocci, so it does not apply here.

(C) **Ability to cleave β-lactam rings** - This refers to the production of β-lactamase enzymes, which can inactivate β-lactam antibiotics like penicillins. Staphylococcus aureus can produce such enzymes, leading to resistance against β-lactam antibiotics.

(D) **Development of efflux pumps** - This mechanism is more commonly associated with gram-negative bacteria and is not a primary resistance mechanism for Staphylococcus aureus.

(E) **Adaptation in binding proteins** - This could refer to changes in penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) that confer resistance, but it is less common than β-lactamase production in Staphylococcus aureus.

Given the context of the infection and the antibiotic treatment, the most likely explanation for the failure to improve with dicloxacillin is:

**Answer: (C) Ability to cleave β-lactam rings.** 

This indicates that the organism is producing β-lactamase, which inactivates the antibiotic, leading to treatment failure.

Question: A 5-year-old boy presents with altered mental status and difficulty breathing for the past couple of hours. The patient’s father, a mechanic, says the boy accidentally ingested an unknown amount of radiator fluid. The patient’s vital signs are: temperature 37.1°C (98.8.F), pulse 116/min, blood pressure 98/78 mm Hg, and respiratory rate 42/min. On physical examination, cardiopulmonary auscultation reveals deep, rapid respirations with no wheezing, rhonchi, or crepitations. An ABG reveals the blood pH to be 7.2 with an anion gap of 16 mEq/L. Urinalysis reveals the presence of oxalate crystals. Which of the following is the most appropriate antidote for the poison that this patient has ingested? (C) Methylene blue (B) Succimer (D) Fomepizole (A) Flumazenil (E) Dimercaprol
Reason: Fomepizole is the most appropriate antidote in this scenario because it is specifically indicated for the treatment of methanol or ethylene glycol poisoning, which is consistent with the symptoms and lab findings of the child. The presence of metabolic acidosis (low pH) and an anion gap, along with oxalate crystals in the urine, suggests ethylene glycol ingestion, making fomepizole the correct choice as it inhibits the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase, thereby preventing the formation of toxic metabolites.
Answer: (D) Fomepizole

Question: A 63-year-old woman presents to her primary-care doctor for a 2-month history of vision changes, specifically citing the gradual onset of double vision. Her double vision is present all the time and does not get better or worse throughout the day. She has also noticed that she has a hard time keeping her right eye open, and her right eyelid looks 'droopy' in the mirror. Physical exam findings during primary gaze are shown in the photo. Her right pupil is 6 mm and poorly reactive to light. The rest of her neurologic exam is unremarkable. Laboratory studies show an Hb A1c of 5.0%. Which of the following is the next best test for this patient? (E) Temporal artery biopsy (B) Direct fundoscopy (C) Intraocular pressures (A) CT head (non-contrast) (D) MR angiography of the head
Reason: MR angiography of the head is the next best test for this patient because her symptoms, particularly the droopy eyelid (ptosis) and double vision, along with the poorly reactive pupil, raise suspicion for a vascular issue such as a cranial nerve palsy possibly due to an aneurysm or vascular malformation. An MR angiography would provide valuable imaging to assess for any vascular abnormalities that could be causing the neurological symptoms she is experiencing.

Question: A 16-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department after losing consciousness. He had no preceding chest pain or palpitations. His father has cataracts and had frontal balding in his twenties but has no history of cardiac disease. His paternal grandfather also had early-onset balding. His pulse is 43/min. Physical examination shows frontal hair loss, temporal muscle wasting, and testicular atrophy. Neurologic examination shows bilateral foot drop and weakness of the intrinsic hand muscles. An ECG shows bradycardia with third-degree atrioventricular block. The severity of this patient's symptoms compared to that of his father is most likely due to which of the following genetic properties? (A) Pleiotropy (D) Penetrance (C) Codominance (E) Anticipation (B) Loss of heterozygosity
Reason: Anticipation is the most likely genetic property contributing to the severity of this patient's symptoms compared to his father's because it refers to the phenomenon where certain genetic disorders present with increasing severity or earlier onset in successive generations. In this case, the boy exhibits more severe symptoms, including significant cardiac issues and muscle weakness, which could suggest a genetic condition that demonstrates anticipation, such as myotonic dystrophy or another hereditary condition influenced by unstable nucleotide expansions.

Question: A 35-year-old woman is involved in a car accident and presents with an open fracture of the left femur and severe bleeding from the left femoral artery. No past medical history or current medications. Her blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg, pulse is 110/min, and respirations are 21/min. On physical examination, the patient is lethargic, confused, and poorly responds to commands. Peripheral pulses are 1+ in the left lower extremity below the level of the knee and 2+ elsewhere. When she arrives at the hospital, a stat hemoglobin level shows 6 g/dL. Which of the following is most correct about the patient’s condition? (D) This patient will likely be diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia (E) This patient’s laboratory findings will likely demonstrate a normocytic anemia (B) Hemoglobin levels are expected to be low right after the accident (A) Her reticulocyte count is expected to be lower than normal (C) Hematocrit is expected to be low right after the accident
Reason: This patient’s laboratory findings will likely demonstrate a normocytic anemia because the acute blood loss from the severe injury has resulted in a rapid decrease in hemoglobin, leading to a decrease in hematocrit without enough time for compensatory erythropoiesis to occur. Given that the blood loss is recent and significant, the red blood cell size is typically normal, causing the anemia to be classified as normocytic rather than microcytic or macrocytic.
Answer: (E) This patient’s laboratory findings will likely demonstrate a normocytic anemia

Question: A 69-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 4-month history of progressive fatigue, cough, shortness of breath, and a 6.6-kg (14.5-lb) weight loss. For the past week, he has had blood-tinged sputum. He is a retired demolition foreman. There is dullness to percussion and decreased breath sounds over the left lung base. A CT scan of the chest shows a left-sided pleural effusion and circumferential pleural thickening with calcifications on the left hemithorax. Pathologic examination of a biopsy specimen of the thickened tissue is most likely to show which of the following findings? (C) Napsin-positive cells in an acinar growth pattern with intracytoplasmatic mucin (E) Large polygonal cells with prominent nucleoli and abundant pale cytoplasm (D) Keratin-producing large polygonal cells with intercellular bridges (B) Calretinin-positive polygonal cells with numerous long surface microvilli (A) Synaptophysin-positive dark blue cells with hyperchromatic nuclei and scarce cytoplasm
Reason: Calretinin-positive polygonal cells with numerous long surface microvilli are the likely findings from a biopsy sample in this case, which is indicative of malignant mesothelioma. The patient's occupational exposure as a demolition foreman and the presentation of pleural thickening and effusion strongly suggest mesothelioma, wherein calretinin is commonly used as a marker to identify mesothelial cells involved in this malignancy.

Question: A 51-year-old man with alcohol use disorder comes to the physician because of a fever and productive cough. An x-ray of the chest shows a right lower lobe consolidation and a diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia is made. The physician prescribes a drug that blocks peptide transfer by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit. Which of the following drugs was most likely prescribed? (D) Azithromycin (A) Doxycycline (E) Ceftriaxone (C) Clindamycin (B) Metronidazole
Reason: Clindamycin is the most likely drug prescribed because it is known to inhibit bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit and is particularly effective against anaerobic bacteria, which are commonly involved in aspiration pneumonia. Given the patient's history of alcohol use disorder and the diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia, clindamycin is often chosen for its strong coverage of anaerobic organisms that can be found in the mouth and throat, which can contribute to infections in the lungs following aspiration.

Question: An autopsy of a patient's heart who recently died in a motor vehicle accident shows multiple nodules near the line of closure on the ventricular side of the mitral valve leaflet. Microscopic examination shows that these nodules are composed of immune complexes, mononuclear cells, and thrombi interwoven with fibrin strands. These nodules are most likely to be found in which of the following patients? (E) A 6-year-old female with subcutaneous nodules and erythema marginatum (D) A 62-year-old male with Cardiobacterium hominis bacteremia (A) A 54-year-old male who recently underwent dental surgery (C) A 41-year-old female with a facial rash and nonerosive arthritis (B) A 71-year-old male with acute-onset high fever and nail bed hemorrhages
Reason: The nodules described in the autopsy findings are indicative of **Libman-Sacks endocarditis**, which is associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a condition that can present with a facial rash and nonerosive arthritis, as seen in the 41-year-old female patient. The presence of immune complexes and mononuclear inflammatory cells in the nodules aligns with the pathological characteristics found in patients with lupus, making her the most likely candidate for such cardiac findings.

Question: A 6-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of headache, cough, runny nose, and a low-grade fever since waking up that morning. He has been healthy except for a urinary tract infection one week ago that has resolved with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole therapy. Both parents have a history of allergic rhinitis. His temperature is 37.8°C (100°F). Physical exam shows rhinorrhea and tenderness over the frontal and maxillary sinuses. There is cervical lymphadenopathy. Laboratory studies show:
Hemoglobin 14.2 g/dL
Leukocyte count 2,700/mm3
Segmented neutrophils 30%
Bands 1%
Eosinophils 4%
Basophils 0%
Lymphocytes 56%
Monocytes 9%
Platelet count 155,000/mm3
Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms?" (C) CMV infection (B) Acute lymphocytic leukemia (E) Acute myelogenous leukemia (A) Medication side effect (D) EBV infection
Reason: The patient's presentation, including the recent resolution of a urinary tract infection and current symptoms of headache, cough, runny nose, and cervical lymphadenopathy, combined with the leukopenia (low white blood cell count) and a predominance of lymphocytes, suggests an abnormality likely related to medication. Since he was treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, a common side effect of this medication can include bone marrow suppression, leading to lower white blood cell counts and potentially contributing to his current symptoms, making medication side effect the most likely underlying cause.
Answer: (A) Medication side effect

Let's analyze the case step by step.

The patient is a 59-year-old man with a history of liver cirrhosis and alcoholism, presenting with confusion, asterixis, jaundice, and guaiac-positive stools (indicating gastrointestinal bleeding). His liver function tests show elevated AST and ALT, low albumin, and elevated bilirubin, which are consistent with liver dysfunction.

Given these findings, the patient is likely experiencing hepatic encephalopathy, a condition that can occur in patients with liver cirrhosis due to the accumulation of toxins (such as ammonia) that the liver can no longer adequately process.

Now, let's evaluate the options:

(A) It carries a good prognosis - This is incorrect. Hepatic encephalopathy can indicate significant liver dysfunction and carries a poor prognosis, especially in the context of cirrhosis.

(B) Ammonia level is the best initial test to confirm the diagnosis - This is somewhat misleading. While elevated ammonia levels can support the diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy, they are not always elevated in all cases, and the diagnosis is often made clinically based on symptoms.

(C) It is a diagnosis of exclusion - This is true. Hepatic encephalopathy is often diagnosed after ruling out other potential causes of altered mental status.

(D) It only occurs in patients with cirrhosis - This is not entirely accurate. While it is most commonly associated with cirrhosis, hepatic encephalopathy can also occur in other liver diseases or acute liver failure.

(E) Electroencephalography (EEG) usually shows focal localizing abnormality - This is incorrect. EEG changes in hepatic encephalopathy typically show generalized slowing rather than focal abnormalities.

Based on this analysis, the best answer is:

**Answer: (C) It is a diagnosis of exclusion.**

Question: A 61-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his son after collapsing to the ground while at home. His son immediately performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation and later the patient underwent successful defibrillation after being evaluated by the emergency medical technician. The patient has a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type II diabetes mellitus. He has smoked one-half pack of cigarettes for approximately 30 years. The patient was admitted to the cardiac intensive care unit, and after a few days developed acute onset right upper extremity weakness. His temperature is 99°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 145/91 mmHg, pulse is 102/min and irregularly irregular, and respirations are 16/min. On physical examination, the patient is alert and orientated to person, place, and time. His language is fluent and he is able to name, repeat, and read. His strength is 5/5 throughout except in the right hand, wrist, and arm, which is 2/5. Based on this patient's clinical presentation, the affected neuronal fibers decussate at which level of the central nervous system? (D) Caudal medulla (C) Pons (A) Primary motor cortex (E) Spinal cord (B) Thalamus
Reason: The answer is (D) Caudal medulla because the right upper extremity weakness in this patient indicates that there may be a lesion affecting the motor pathways that control movement. In the central nervous system, the fibers responsible for voluntary motor control decussate (cross over) at the caudal medulla before continuing down the spinal cord to innervate muscles. Therefore, a dysfunction in this area would lead to weakness in the contralateral upper extremity, consistent with the patient's symptoms.

Question: A 58-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after a witnessed tonic-clonic seizure. His wife says he has had a persistent dry cough for 6 months. During this time period, he has also had fatigue and a 4.5-kg (10-lb) weight loss. The patient has no history of serious illness and does not take any medications. He has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for 35 years. He is confused and oriented only to person. Laboratory studies show a serum sodium concentration of 119 mEq/L and glucose concentration of 102 mg/dL. An x-ray of the chest shows an irregular, poorly demarcated density at the right hilum. Microscopic examination of this density is most likely to confirm which of the following diagnoses? (D) Bronchial carcinoid tumor (B) Small cell lung carcinoma (E) Lung adenocarcinoma (A) Squamous cell lung carcinoma (C) Large cell lung carcinoma
Reason: The answer is (B) Small cell lung carcinoma because the patient's symptoms, including a persistent dry cough, significant weight loss, and confusion, are suggestive of a malignancy that could be causing paraneoplastic syndromes, such as hyponatremia due to the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). Additionally, his heavy smoking history and the presence of an irregular, poorly defined lung mass align with the characteristics of small cell lung carcinoma, which is often associated with rapid progression and systemic effects.
Answer: (B) Small cell lung carcinoma

Question: A 32-year-old woman who recently emigrated to the USA from Japan comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of night sweats, malaise, and joint pain. During this time, she has also had a 6-kg (13-lb) weight loss. Physical examination shows weak brachial and radial pulses. There are tender subcutaneous nodules on both legs. Carotid bruits are heard on auscultation bilaterally. Laboratory studies show an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 96 mm/h. A CT scan of the chest shows thickening and narrowing of the aortic arch. Microscopic examination of the aortic arch is most likely to show which of the following findings? (D) Subendothelial immune complex deposition (B) Granulomatous inflammation of the media (E) Calcification of the media (A) Fibrinoid necrosis of the intima and media (C) Subendothelial hyaline deposition
Reason: The answer is (B) Granulomatous inflammation of the media because the clinical presentation, including night sweats, malaise, joint pain, and subcutaneous nodules, along with imaging findings of aortic arch involvement, suggests a diagnosis consistent with Takayasu arteritis, which is characterized by granulomatous inflammation affecting large arteries, particularly the aorta and its branches. This type of inflammation results in stenosis and changes in the vessel wall that can lead to systemic symptoms due to ischemia.
Answer: (B) Granulomatous inflammation of the media

Question: At a routine exam, a 68-year-old woman is discovered to have a serum calcium level of 11.5 mg/dL. Follow-up laboratory tests show a high parathyroid hormone with low phosphorus and mildly elevated alkaline phosphatase. 24-hour urine calcium level is elevated. Review of symptoms includes complaints of fatigue, constipation, and diffuse bone pain for which she takes vitamin D. Past medical history is significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus for 25 years and essential hypertension for 15 years. The patient has a history of kidney stones. Family history is irrelevant. Which of the following radiologic findings is consistent with the patient's condition? (A) Subperiosteal bone resorption on hand X-ray (E) Fibronodular opacities in upper lobes of the lung with or without cavitation (C) Osteopenia, osteolytic lesions and pathological fractures (B) Hilar and/or paratracheal adenopathy with bilateral upper lobe lung infiltrates (D) Lytic changes in early stage and sclerotic picture in later stage
Reason: The answer is (A) Subperiosteal bone resorption on hand X-ray because the patient's elevated serum calcium, high parathyroid hormone, low phosphorus, and symptoms such as fatigue, constipation, and bone pain are indicative of primary hyperparathyroidism. This condition often leads to characteristic radiological findings, including subperiosteal bone resorption, particularly noticeable in the phalangeal tufts of the fingers, and reflects the increased osteoclastic activity due to elevated parathyroid hormone levels.
Answer: (A) Subperiosteal bone resorption on hand X-ray

Question: Four days after admission to the hospital for anorexia nervosa, a 20-year-old woman has new-onset palpitations and paresthesias in all four limbs. Prior to admission, she was found unconscious by her parents on the floor of a residential treatment center. The patient was started on a trial of nutritional rehabilitation upon arrival to the hospital. Her temperature is 36°C (96.8°F), pulse is 47/min, and blood pressure is 90/60 mmHg. She is 160 cm tall and weighs 35 kg; BMI is 14 kg/m2. The patient appears emaciated. Examination shows lower leg edema. A 2/6 holosystolic murmur is heard over the 5th intercostal space at the midclavicular line. AN ECG shows intermittent supraventricular tachycardia and QTc prolongation. Serum studies show:
Day 2 Day 4
Potassium (mEq/L) 3.5 2.7
Calcium (mg/dL) 8.5 7.8
Magnesium (mEq/L) 1.2 0.5
Phosphorus (mg/dL) 3.6 1.5
Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition?" (E) Euthyroid sick syndrome (B) Rapid gastric emptying (D) Increased insulin release (C) Uncompensated metabolic alkalosis (A) Thiamine deficiency
Reason: The answer is (D) Increased insulin release because the patient's symptoms of hypokalemia (low potassium), hypomagnesemia (low magnesium), and hypophosphatemia (low phosphorus) are consistent with refeeding syndrome, which can occur during nutritional rehabilitation in individuals with anorexia nervosa. As caloric intake increases, insulin secretion rises in response to carbohydrates, leading to cellular uptake of electrolytes such as potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus, which can precipitate the complications observed in this patient.
Answer: (D) Increased insulin release

Question: A 30-year-old African American woman comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of increasing shortness of breath, cough, and intermittent fever. She works in a local factory that manufactures components for airplanes. She drinks 2–3 glasses of wine daily and has smoked half a pack of cigarettes daily for the past 5 years. Physical examination shows a purple rash on her cheeks and nose. An x-ray of the chest shows bilateral hilar adenopathy and a calcified nodule in the left lower lobe. A bronchoalveolar lavage shows a CD4:CD8 T-lymphocyte ratio of 10:1 (N=2:1). A biopsy of the nodule shows a noncaseating granuloma. Which of the following is the strongest predisposing factor for the development of this patient's condition? (E) Exposure to acid-fast bacilli
" (D) Smoking (A) Race (B) Exposure to beryllium (C) Alcohol consumption
Reason: The answer is (A) Race because this patient's profile of symptoms, including shortness of breath, cough, fever, rash, and the chest X-ray findings of bilateral hilar adenopathy and noncaseating granulomas, strongly suggest sarcoidosis, which disproportionately affects African American women. While other factors may contribute to individual risk, race is a significant epidemiological factor associated with a higher incidence and prevalence of sarcoidosis, particularly in this demographic group.
Answer: (A) Race

Question: A 67-year-old man presents to your office with a chief complaint of constipation and many other perturbing minor medical concerns. He reports tiring easily, which he attributes to old age and years of persistent pain in his back and ribs. A complete blood count shows low hemoglobin and elevated serum creatinine. A peripheral blood smear shows stacks of red blood cells among other findings, and serum electropheresis reveals an abnormal concentration of protein resulting in a spike. Which of the following additional findings would you expect to see in this patient? (E) No additional findings - normal aging explains symptoms (D) Bence-Jones proteins in the urine (A) Early satiety and splenomegaly (C) An elevated PSA and a nodular prostate (B) Smudge cells on peripheral smear
Reason: The answer is (D) Bence-Jones proteins in the urine because the patient’s symptoms of anemia, kidney dysfunction, and the findings of stacked red blood cells (rouleaux formation) along with a monoclonal spike in serum protein suggest the diagnosis of multiple myeloma. In this condition, light chains of immunoglobulins, known as Bence-Jones proteins, are produced in excess and can be excreted in the urine, making their presence a common finding in patients with this disease.
Answer: (D) Bence-Jones proteins in the urine

Let's think step by step. 

The patient presents with symptoms that are suggestive of adrenal insufficiency, including fatigue, weakness, abdominal pain, constipation, weight loss, and notably, the bronze discoloration of the skin. The low blood pressure and bradycardia (pulse of 63/min) further support the possibility of adrenal insufficiency, particularly primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease).

In cases of suspected adrenal crisis or significant adrenal insufficiency, the immediate management involves administering glucocorticoids to address the deficiency and prevent further complications. 

Given the options provided, the most appropriate next step in management for this patient, who likely has adrenal insufficiency, is:

**(A) Administer intravenous hydrocortisone.**

This choice is critical to stabilize the patient and address the acute adrenal insufficiency. After stabilization, further testing (such as an ACTH stimulation test) can be performed to confirm the diagnosis and determine the underlying cause.

Question: A 73-year-old woman is brought to the physician by her son because of increasing forgetfulness over the past 2 years. Initially, she used to misplace keys and forget her dog's name or her phone number. Now, she often forgets about what she has seen on television or read about the day before. She used to go for a walk every morning but stopped one month ago after she became lost on her way back home. Her son has prevented her from cooking because she has had episodes of leaving the gas stove oven on after making a meal. She becomes agitated when asked questions directly but is unconcerned when her son reports her history and says he is overprotective of her. She has hypertension, coronary artery disease, and hypercholesterolemia. Current medications include aspirin, enalapril, carvedilol, and atorvastatin. She is alert and oriented to place and person but not to time. Vital signs are within normal limits. Short- and long-term memory deficits are present. Her speech rhythm is normal but is frequently interrupted as she thinks of words to frame her sentences. She makes multiple errors while performing serial sevens. Her clock drawing is impaired and she draws 14 numbers. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? (A) Normal pressure hydrocephalus (E) Alzheimer disease (B) Lewy-body dementia (D) Creutzfeld-Jakob disease (C) Frontotemporal dementia
Reason: The answer is (E) Alzheimer disease, as the characteristics described in the vignette—progressive memory loss, difficulty with daily tasks, and impaired judgment—are indicative of this condition. Furthermore, her increasing forgetfulness, episodes of getting lost, and inability to perform complex tasks such as cooking underline the cognitive decline commonly associated with Alzheimer disease, making it the most likely diagnosis in this scenario.

Question: A 63-year-old woman presents to her primary care provider with her spouse for routine follow-up. She has a history of schizophrenia and is currently living at a nursing facility. Her symptoms first started 2 years ago, when she developed auditory hallucinations and her family noticed that her thoughts and speech became more tangential and disorganized. After being referred to a psychiatrist, the patient was started on medication. Currently she reports occasional auditory hallucinations, but her spouse states that her symptoms have improved dramatically with medication. On exam, her temperature is 98.4°F (36.9°C), blood pressure is 110/74 mmHg, pulse is 64/min, and respirations are 12/min. The patient has normal affect with well-formulated, non-pressured speech. She denies any audiovisual hallucinations. Notably, however, the patient has repetitive lip-smacking behavior and occasionally sweeps her tongue across her lips. The spouse is curious about how this developed. Which of the following is the most likely medication this patient was started on? (D) Quetiapine (E) Risperidone (A) Clozapine (B) Haloperidol (C) Olanzapine
Reason: The answer is (B) Haloperidol. This patient appears to be experiencing tardive dyskinesia, which is characterized by repetitive movements such as lip-smacking and tongue movements. Haloperidol, a typical antipsychotic, is known to have a higher risk of causing extrapyramidal side effects, including tardive dyskinesia compared to atypical antipsychotics like quetiapine, risperidone, or olanzapine.

Question: A 45-year-old female is admitted to the hospital after worsening headaches for the past month. She has noticed that the headaches are usually generalized, and frequently occur during sleep. She does not have a history of migraines or other types of headaches. Her past medical history is significant for breast cancer, which was diagnosed a year ago and treated with mastectomy. She recovered fully and returned to work shortly thereafter. CT scan of the brain now shows a solitary cortical 5cm mass surrounded by edema in the left hemisphere of the brain at the grey-white matter junction. She is admitted to the hospital for further management. What is the most appropriate next step in management for this patient? (A) Chemotherapy (E) Surgical resection of the mass (D) Irradiation to the brain mass (B) Seizure prophylaxis and palliative pain therapy (C) Irradiation to the breasts
Reason: The answer is (E) Surgical resection of the mass. Given this patient's history of breast cancer and the presentation of a solitary cortical mass with associated edema, the mass is likely a metastatic lesion, which may require removal to relieve symptoms such as headaches and to confirm diagnosis through pathology. Surgical resection is often appropriate for symptomatic brain tumors, particularly when they are accessible and of significant size, as it can improve neurological function and determine the precise nature of the lesion.

Question: A 65-year-old non-smoking woman with no symptoms comes to your clinic to establish care with a primary care provider. She hasn’t seen a doctor in 12 years and states that she feels very healthy. You realize that guidelines by the national cancer organization suggest that she is due for some cancer screening tests, including a mammogram for breast cancer, a colonoscopy for colon cancer, and a pap smear for cervical cancer. These three screening tests are most likely to be considered which of the following? (D) Quaternary prevention (C) Tertiary prevention (E) Cancer screening does not fit into these categories (A) Primary prevention (B) Secondary prevention
Reason: The answer is (B) Secondary prevention. Cancer screening tests such as mammograms, colonoscopies, and Pap smears are aimed at detecting cancer at an earlier stage before symptoms develop, which is the definition of secondary prevention. This approach seeks to reduce morbidity and mortality by identifying diseases early when they are more treatable, distinguishing it from primary prevention (which focuses on preventing disease altogether) and tertiary prevention (which focuses on reducing complications after a disease has been diagnosed).

Question: A 15-year-old boy presents with sudden onset right sided weakness of his arm and face and difficulty speaking. He denies any problems with hearing or comprehension. The patient has no history of chest pain, hypertension, or diabetes mellitus. No significant past medical history. The patient is afebrile, and vital signs are within normal limits. On physical examination, the patient is thin, with long arms and slender fingers. There is a right-sided facial droop present. Ophthalmic examination reveals a dislocated lens in the right eye. Strength is 3 out of 5 in the right upper extremity, and there is a positive Babinski reflex on the right. The CT scan of the head shows no evidence of hemorrhage. Laboratory findings are significant for increased concentrations of a metabolic intermediate in his serum and urine. Which of the following enzymes is most likely deficient in this patient? (D) Hydroxymethylbilane (HMB) synthase (B) Homogentisate oxidase (E) Branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase (A) Phenylalanine hydroxylase (C) Cystathionine synthase
Reason: The answer is (C) Cystathionine synthase. The patient's symptoms—sudden right-sided weakness and facial droop, along with the physical findings of long arms, slender fingers, and a dislocated lens—suggest a marfanoid appearance, which may be associated with homocystinuria resulting from cystathionine synthase deficiency. The increased concentrations of metabolic intermediates in the serum and urine, specifically homocysteine, align with this deficiency, leading to neurological and systemic complications such as the ones described.

A clinical diagnosis is made and supported by the surgical consult team in lieu of imaging. The next operating room for an add-on procedure will not be available for another 5 hours. Appropriate medical therapy is initiated. What is the best next step for surgical optimization? (B) Fresh frozen plasma (C) Phytonadione (E) Prothrombin complex concentrate (D) Protamine (A) Do nothing
Reason: The answer is (B) Fresh frozen plasma. The patient has an elevated INR of 6.2, indicating significant anticoagulant effect from warfarin, which increases the risk of bleeding during surgery. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) is used to rapidly reverse the effects of warfarin by providing clotting factors, thus optimizing the patient's hemostatic status before the surgical intervention, especially since the patient requires an urgent surgical procedure and may be at risk of bleeding complications during surgery.
Answer: (B) Fresh frozen plasma

Question: A 35-year-old woman comes to the physician accompanied by her husband after he started noticing strange behavior. He first noticed her talking to herself 8 months ago. For the past 6 months, she has refused to eat any packaged foods out of fear that the government is trying to poison her. She has no significant past medical history. She smoked marijuana in college but has not smoked any since. She appears restless. Mental status examination shows a flat affect. Her speech is clear, but her thought process is disorganized with many loose associations. The patient is diagnosed with schizophrenia and started on olanzapine. This patient is most likely to experience which of the following adverse effects? (C) Dyslipidemia (B) Diabetes insipidus (D) Agranulocytosis (A) Seizures (E) Myoglobinuria
"
Reason: The answer is (C) Dyslipidemia. Olanzapine, which is an atypical antipsychotic, is associated with metabolic side effects, including weight gain and dyslipidemia, which can increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. Patients taking olanzapine often experience changes in lipid metabolism, leading to elevated levels of triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, making dyslipidemia a common and significant concern in this patient population.
Answer: (C) Dyslipidemia

Let's analyze the case step by step.

The patient is a 46-year-old woman presenting with severe muscle and joint pain, joint stiffness, fatigue, and tingling sensations in her lower limbs. The examination reveals symmetric muscular tenderness, but strength and deep tendon reflexes are normal. Laboratory studies show normal blood counts, normal thyroid function, and a low erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), which suggests that there is no significant inflammatory process occurring.

Given her symptoms and the normal laboratory findings, this presentation is suggestive of fibromyalgia, a condition characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, and often associated with sleep disturbances and mood disorders. 

In terms of treatment options for fibromyalgia, the most appropriate therapies include:

- **Amitriptyline**: This is a tricyclic antidepressant that is often used to help manage fibromyalgia symptoms, particularly pain and sleep disturbances.

The other options:
- **Temazepam** is a benzodiazepine that may help with sleep but is not a first-line treatment for fibromyalgia.
- **Methotrexate** is used for inflammatory conditions like rheumatoid arthritis but is not indicated for fibromyalgia.
- **Bupropion** is an antidepressant that is not typically used for fibromyalgia.
- **Vitamin B12** supplementation is not indicated unless there is a deficiency.

Based on this analysis, the most appropriate therapy for this patient is:

**Answer: (D) Amitriptyline**.

Question: A 36-year-old woman comes to the physician because she has not had her menstrual period for the past 4 months. During this period, she has had frequent headaches, difficulty sleeping, and increased sweating. She has not had any weight changes. Over the past year, menses occurred at irregular 30- to 45-day intervals with light flow. The patient underwent two successful cesarean sections at the ages of 28 and 32. She has two healthy children. She is sexually active with her husband and does not use condoms. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show:
Estradiol 8 pg/mL (mid-follicular phase: N=27–123 pg/mL)
Follicle-stimulating hormone 200 mIU/mL
Luteinizing hormone 180 mIU/mL
Prolactin 16 ng/mL
Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?" (A) Primary hypothyroidism (B) Pregnancy (D) Polycystic ovary syndrome (C) Premature ovarian failure (E) Major depressive disorder
Reason: The most likely diagnosis is (C) Premature ovarian failure. This conclusion is supported by the laboratory findings which show very low estradiol levels and extremely high levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). Such hormonal patterns are indicative of ovarian dysfunction and suggest that the ovaries are not producing sufficient estrogen, leading to amenorrhea and other associated symptoms.
Answer: (C) Premature ovarian failure

Question: An investigator is studying bacterial toxins in a nonpathogenic bacterial monoculture that has been inoculated with specific bacteriophages. These phages were previously cultured in a toxin-producing bacterial culture. After inoculation, a new toxin is isolated from the culture. Genetic sequencing shows that the bacteria have incorporated viral genetic information, including the gene for this toxin, into their genome. The described process is most likely responsible for acquired pathogenicity in which of the following bacteria? (A) Staphylococcus aureus (E) Streptococcus pneumoniae (C) Haemophilus influenzae (D) Neisseria meningitidis (B) Corynebacterium diphtheriae
Reason: The answer is (B) Corynebacterium diphtheriae because this bacterium is known to have acquired its pathogenicity through the process of lysogenic conversion, where a nonpathogenic bacterium becomes virulent by incorporating viral DNA that carries toxin genes. This phenomenon is exemplified by the diphtheria toxin gene, which is carried by a bacteriophage and capable of turning the nonpathogenic strains of C. diphtheriae into pathogenic ones.
Answer: (B) Corynebacterium diphtheriae

Question: A 73-year-old woman is brought to the physician by her son because of increasing forgetfulness over the past 2 years. Initially, she used to misplace keys and forget her dog's name or her phone number. Now, she often forgets about what she has seen on television or read about the day before. She used to go for a walk every morning but stopped one month ago after she became lost on her way back home. Her son has prevented her from cooking because she has had episodes of leaving the gas stove oven on after making a meal. She becomes agitated when asked questions directly but is unconcerned when her son reports her history and says he is overprotective of her. She has hypertension, coronary artery disease, and hypercholesterolemia. Current medications include aspirin, enalapril, carvedilol, and atorvastatin. She is alert and oriented to place and person but not to time. Vital signs are within normal limits. Short- and long-term memory deficits are present. Her speech rhythm is normal but is frequently interrupted as she thinks of words to frame her sentences. She makes multiple errors while performing serial sevens. Her clock drawing is impaired and she draws 14 numbers. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? (E) Alzheimer disease (A) Normal pressure hydrocephalus (D) Creutzfeld-Jakob disease (C) Frontotemporal dementia (B) Lewy-body dementia
Reason: The most likely diagnosis is (E) Alzheimer disease because the patient's gradual decline in memory function, including short- and long-term memory deficits, suggests typical cognitive impairment seen in Alzheimer's. Additionally, her difficulty with word finding, impaired clock drawing, and inability to keep track of time are consistent with the cognitive deficits associated with Alzheimer disease, which often includes memory loss, disorientation, and challenges with language and daily functioning.

Question: A 16-year-old boy presents to the emergency department after a skateboarding accident. He fell on a broken bottle and received a 4 cm wound on the dorsal aspect of his left hand. His vitals are stable and he was evaluated by the surgeon on call who determined to suture was not required. After several weeks the wound has almost completely healed (see image). Which of the following is the correct description of this patient’s wound before healing? (C) Laceration (B) Abrasion (A) Incised wound (D) Avulsion (E) Puncture
Reason: The correct description of this patient's wound before healing is (A) Incised wound. This designation is appropriate because an incised wound is typically characterized by a clean, straight-cut injury caused by a sharp object, such as the broken bottle in this case, as opposed to other types of wounds like abrasions or lacerations that are caused by friction or tearing. The specific circumstances of the injury suggest a precise edge and depth typical of an incised wound.

Question: A 46-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 4-month history of progressively worsening fatigue and loss of appetite. Five years ago, he received a kidney transplant from a living family member. Current medications include sirolimus and mycophenolate. His blood pressure is 150/95 mm Hg. Laboratory studies show normocytic, normochromic anemia and a serum creatinine concentration of 3.1 mg/dL; his vital signs and laboratory studies were normal 6 months ago. Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient’s increase in creatinine concentration? (A) CD8+ T cell-mediated parenchymal cell damage (C) Donor endothelial cell damage by preformed host antibodies (D) CD4+ T cell-mediated intimal smooth muscle proliferation (E) Drug-induced tubular vacuolization (B) Donor T cell-mediated epithelial cell damage
Reason: The most likely underlying mechanism of this patient’s increase in creatinine concentration is (D) CD4+ T cell-mediated intimal smooth muscle proliferation. This mechanism is associated with chronic rejection, particularly in kidney transplant patients, where CD4+ T cells can mediate damage leading to intimal arteritis and smooth muscle proliferation, resulting in narrowing of the renal blood vessels and impaired kidney function. Given the patient's prolonged immunosuppressive therapy and recent decline in renal function, chronic allograft rejection is a plausible explanation for the elevated serum creatinine.
Answer: (D) CD4+ T cell-mediated intimal smooth muscle proliferation

Question: A 22-year-old man presents to the emergency department with anxiety. The patient states that he is very anxious and has not been able to take his home anxiety medications. He is requesting to have his home medications administered. The patient has a past medical history of anxiety and depression. His current medications include clonazepam, amitriptyline, and lorazepam. Notably, the patient has multiple psychiatric providers who currently care for him. His temperature is 99.2°F (37.3°C), blood pressure is 130/85 mmHg, pulse is 112/min, respirations are 22/min, and oxygen saturation is 100% on room air. Physical exam is notable for an anxious, sweating, and tremulous young man who becomes more confused during his stay in the emergency department. Which of the following should be given to this patient? (E) Supportive therapy and monitoring (B) Flumazenil (A) Diazepam (D) Sodium bicarbonate (C) Midazolam
Reason: The appropriate treatment for this patient is (A) Diazepam. This recommendation is based on the need for anxiolytic medication to manage his acute anxiety symptoms, especially considering his history of anxiety and multiple medications he was previously prescribed. Diazepam, as a benzodiazepine, can provide effective relief for withdrawal or exacerbation of anxiety while also offering sedation, making it suitable for managing symptoms associated with his current presentation.
Answer: (A) Diazepam

Let's analyze the situation step by step.

The patient has a left C5 hemicord lesion, which suggests that there is damage to the left side of the spinal cord at the C5 level. This type of injury can lead to specific neurological deficits based on the anatomy of the spinal cord and the pathways involved.

1. **Corticospinal Tract**: The corticospinal tract carries motor signals from the brain to the body. Damage to the left side of the spinal cord would typically result in weakness or paralysis on the same side (left side) at and below the level of the lesion. Therefore, we would expect spastic paralysis on the left side.

2. **Sensory Pathways**: The spinothalamic tract carries pain and temperature sensations and crosses over to the opposite side of the body. Therefore, a left hemicord lesion would lead to a loss of pain and temperature sensation on the right side of the body (contralateral).

3. **Dorsal Columns**: The dorsal columns carry vibration and proprioception sensations and do not cross until they reach the medulla. Therefore, a left hemicord lesion would not affect the right side's vibration and proprioception sensations.

4. **Horner's Syndrome**: This syndrome is caused by damage to the sympathetic pathways, which can occur with lesions in the cervical region. However, it is not directly related to a hemicord lesion at C5.

Given this analysis, the most likely additional finding in this patient with a left C5 hemicord lesion would be:

- **Right-sided analgesia** (loss of pain and temperature sensation on the right side due to contralateral spinothalamic tract involvement).

Thus, the correct answer is:

**(D) Right-sided analgesia**.

Question: A 25-year-old woman presents her physician with a complaint of feeling tired and low on energy for the past 6 months. She also has noticed she has been having trouble performing daily tasks and at times experiencing near-fainting spells. She has no recollection of similar instances in the past. Her past medical history is insignificant, except for the fact that she has been a strict vegan for the last 5 years. Her vital signs are stable. On physical examination, she is visibly pale and has decreased position and vibratory sensation in her both lower extremities. There is decreased lower limb reflexes with sensation intact. A complete blood count - done last week, - shows hemoglobin of 9.7 g/dL with an MCV of 110 fL. The serum levels of which of the following will most likely aid in the physician’s treatment plan? (B) Homocysteine (E) Methylmalonic acid (D) Folate (C) Ferritin (A) Succinyl CoA
Reason: The patient's presentation, including macrocytic anemia indicated by an MCV of 110 fL, neurological symptoms, and her strict vegan diet, is suggestive of vitamin B12 deficiency. Measuring methylmalonic acid (MMA) levels helps confirm B12 deficiency, as MMA levels rise in this condition due to impaired metabolism, and this information is critical for guiding appropriate treatment.

Let's analyze the situation step by step. The patient is exhibiting signs consistent with a manic episode, possibly indicative of bipolar disorder, given the sudden change in behavior, increased talkativeness, grandiosity, and agitation when his suggestions are not accepted. 

In terms of predictors of good prognosis in mood disorders, particularly bipolar disorder, the following factors are generally considered:

- **Affective symptoms** (A): The presence of affective symptoms, such as depressive episodes, can indicate a more typical course of bipolar disorder and may suggest a better prognosis.
- **Slow onset** (B): A slow onset of symptoms is often associated with a better prognosis compared to a rapid onset.
- **Being single** (C): Being single is generally not considered a predictor of good prognosis.
- **Negative symptoms** (E): Negative symptoms are typically associated with worse outcomes, especially in schizophrenia.
- **Male sex** (D): While there are differences in the prevalence of mood disorders between sexes, male sex alone is not a strong predictor of prognosis.

Given this analysis, the best answer that aligns with predictors of good prognosis in this context is:

**Answer: (A) Affective symptoms**

Question: A 15-year-old boy comes to the physician because of skin changes on his face, chest, and back over the past year. Treatment with over-the-counter benzoyl peroxide has been ineffective. Physical examination shows numerous open comedones, inflammatory papules, and pustules on his face, chest, and back. Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient’s skin condition? (A) Hyperplasia of pilosebaceous glands (D) Excess androgen production (E) Type IV hypersensitivity reaction (C) Hyperkeratinization of hair follicles (B) Formation of superficial epidermal inclusion cyst
Reason: The likely answer is (D) Excess androgen production because the clinical presentation of numerous open comedones, inflammatory papules, and pustules is characteristic of acne vulgaris, which is often driven by androgens that increase sebum production and contribute to the formation of acne lesions. In this adolescent male, the role of excess androgens in stimulating the sebaceous glands can lead to the obstructive and inflammatory changes seen in acne, explaining his condition.
Answer: (D) Excess androgen production

Question: A 49-year-old man comes to the physician because of tender, red nodules that appeared on his chest 3 days ago. Three weeks ago, he had similar symptoms in his right lower limb and another episode in his left foot; both episodes resolved spontaneously. He also has diarrhea and has had a poor appetite for 1 month. He has a history of dry cough and joint pain, for which he takes albuterol and aspirin as needed. He has smoked 2 packs of cigarettes daily for 15 years. He does not drink alcohol. Physical examination shows a linear, erythematous lesion on the right anterior chest wall, through which a cord-like structure can be palpated. The lungs are clear to auscultation. The abdomen is soft, nontender, and non-distended. Examination of the legs is normal. An ultrasound of the legs shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis of the underlying condition? (D) Coagulation studies (C) X-ray of the chest (A) Serum angiotensin-converting enzyme level (E) Ankle brachial index (B) CT scan of the abdomen
Reason: The likely answer is (B) CT scan of the abdomen because the combination of tender red nodules, a history of similar skin lesions, diarrhea, poor appetite, and a history of dry cough raise suspicion for a potential underlying condition, such as sarcoidosis or another abdominal pathology. A CT scan of the abdomen can help evaluate for potential granulomatous disease or other abnormalities, aiding in the diagnosis of the patient's symptoms and directing appropriate management.
Answer: (B) CT scan of the abdomen

Question: A 33-year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse and cirrhosis presents to the emergency department with profuse vomiting. The patient is aggressive, combative, emotionally labile, and has to be chemically restrained. The patient continues to vomit and blood is noted in the vomitus. His temperature is 99.2°F (37.3°C), blood pressure is 139/88 mmHg, pulse is 106/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 100% on room air. The patient complains of sudden onset chest pain during his physical exam. A crunching and rasping sound is heard while auscultating the heart. Which of the following is the pathophysiology of the most likely diagnosis? (A) Dilated and tortuous veins (E) Transmural tear (B) Inflammation of the pericardium (C) Mucosal tear (D) Pericardial fluid accumulation
Reason: The likely answer is (E) Transmural tear because the patient's presentation is highly suggestive of Boerhaave syndrome, which is a rupture of the esophagus due to severe vomiting. The presence of chest pain, the noted blood in the vomitus, and the characteristic "Hamman's sign" (crunching sounds during heart auscultation caused by air in the mediastinum) point to a transmural tear in the esophageal wall as the underlying pathophysiology, leading to critical complications such as mediastinitis and sepsis.
Answer: (E) Transmural tear

Let's analyze the situation step by step.

1. **Patient Presentation**: The 26-year-old man has been involved in a motor vehicle accident and presents with extreme abdominal pain, particularly in the left upper quadrant. His vital signs indicate hypotension (BP 82/50 mmHg) and tachycardia (HR 180 bpm), which are concerning for shock.

2. **Physical Exam Findings**: The exam shows abdominal wall rigidity, involuntary guarding, and tenderness, which suggest peritonitis, likely due to internal bleeding (hemoperitoneum) as indicated by the bedside sonography.

3. **Current Management**: Despite administering intravenous fluids, the patient remains hypotensive and tachycardic, indicating that he is likely in hypovolemic shock, possibly due to internal bleeding.

4. **Next Steps in Management**: Given the evidence of hemoperitoneum and the patient's unstable vital signs, the best next step is to address the source of bleeding and stabilize the patient. 

Considering all of this, the most appropriate next step in management is:

**(E) Exploratory laparotomy** 

This is necessary to identify and control the source of bleeding, especially given the signs of significant abdominal injury and the patient's hemodynamic instability.

Question: An 8-year-old African-American boy is brought to the emergency room with severe pain in both hands. His mother says that the patient had a fever with a cough a couple of days ago. Family history is positive for an uncle who died from a blood disease. A peripheral blood smear of this patient is shown in the image. Which of the following is the most likely mechanism for this patient’s disease? (D) Silent mutation (A) Nonsense mutation (B) Frameshift mutation (C) Mismatch repair (E) Missense mutation
Reason: The most likely mechanism for this patient’s disease is (E) Missense mutation. In cases of sickle cell disease, which is common in African-American populations and can present with severe pain during vaso-occlusive crises, the underlying genetic abnormality is a specific point mutation in the HBB gene that results in the substitution of valine for glutamic acid in hemoglobin, leading to the characteristic sickling of red blood cells. This substitution exemplifies a missense mutation, where a single nucleotide change results in the coding of a different amino acid.

Question: A 50-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of fever and productive cough with blood in the sputum for 1 day. She also reports a sharp pain under her ribs that is worsened on taking deep breaths. Over the past 2 years, she has had repeated episodes of sinusitis, for which she used over the counter medication. She has recently started a new job at a wire-mesh factory. Her temperature is 38.3°C (100.9 °F), pulse is 72/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 120/80 mm Hg. Physical examination shows palpable nonblanching skin lesions over her hands and feet. Examination of the nasal cavity shows ulcerations of the nasopharyngeal mucosa and a small septal perforation. Pulmonary examination shows stridor on inspiration. Laboratory studies show:
Hemoglobin 13.2 g/dL
Leukocyte count 10,300/mm3
Platelet count 205,000/mm3
Serum
Urea nitrogen 24 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.4 mg/dL

Question: An otherwise healthy 23-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-day history of mild persistent bleeding from the site of a tooth extraction. He has no prior history of medical procedures or surgeries and no history of easy bruising. He appears well. Vital signs are within normal limits. Laboratory studies show:
Hemoglobin 12.4 g/dL
Platelets 200,000/mm3
Serum
Prothrombin time 25 seconds
Partial thromboplastin time (activated) 35 seconds
Deficiency of which of the following coagulation factors is the most likely cause of this patient’s condition?" (A) Factor VII (C) Factor II (D) Factor XIII (B) Factor V (E) Factor X
Reason: The most likely cause of this patient's condition is (A) Factor VII deficiency. The prolonged prothrombin time (PT) of 25 seconds, with a normal activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of 35 seconds, suggests a defect in the extrinsic pathway of coagulation, where Factor VII plays a critical role. Since Factor VII is crucial for the initiation of the coagulation cascade and has a relatively short half-life, its deficiency fits well with the patient's presentation of mild bleeding following a dental procedure.
Answer: (A) Factor VII

Question: A 9-year-old girl is brought to the pediatrician for a wellness checkup. The girl's past medical history is non-contributory, and she has met all her developmental milestones. Her parents were recently called into the office as the girl was found touching the genitals of one of her classmates. She was trying to insert a toy into her classmate's genitals. The girl is asked what has happened and what she thinks is going on but she is too shy to reply to the physician. The girl and her mother recently moved in with a family member. They live in low-income housing subsidized by the government and are currently on food stamps. The mother states that her daughter has been particularly argumentative lately and that they have gotten into arguments in which her daughter screamed at her and locked herself in the bathroom. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? (B) Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (E) Sexual abuse (D) Precocious puberty (C) Normal variant of development (A) Adjustment disorder
Reason: The most likely diagnosis in this case is (E) Sexual abuse. The inappropriate sexual behavior demonstrated by the girl, such as touching the genitals of a classmate and attempting to insert an object, is concerning for exposure to sexual content or experiences beyond what is typical for her developmental stage. Given the context of the family's recent changes, including moving in with another family member and her behavioral changes such as increased argumentativeness, these factors further support the suspicion of sexual abuse.
Answer: (E) Sexual abuse

Question: A 15-year-old boy is brought to the emergency room for evaluation of malaise, dyspnea, and yellow skin and sclera. On examination, he is tachycardic, tachypneic, and the O2 saturation is less than 90%. The levels of unconjugated bilirubin and hemoglobinemia are increased, and there is an increased number of reticulocytes in the peripheral blood. What is the most likely diagnosis? (E) Aplastic anemia (B) Acute leukemia (A) Anemia of chronic disease (C) Sideropenic anemia (D) Hemolytic anemia
Reason: The most likely diagnosis for this patient is (D) Hemolytic anemia. The presence of increased unconjugated bilirubin and hemoglobinemia, along with an elevated reticulocyte count, indicates that the bone marrow is responding to increased destruction of red blood cells, which is characteristic of hemolytic anemia. The symptoms of malaise, dyspnea, and jaundice (yellow skin and sclera) further support the diagnosis, as these are commonly seen in patients experiencing significant hemolysis.

Question: A 27-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by emergency medical services. The patient was an unrestrained passenger in a head-on collision that occurred 15 minutes ago and is currently unresponsive. His temperature is 99.5°F (37.5°C), blood pressure is 60/33 mmHg, pulse is 180/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 95% on room air. A FAST exam demonstrates fluid in Morrison’s pouch. Laboratory values are drawn upon presentation to the ED and sent off. The patient is started on IV fluids and an initial trauma survey is started. Twenty minutes later, his blood pressure is 95/65 mmHg, and his pulse is 110/min. The patient is further stabilized and is scheduled for emergency surgery. Which of the following best represents this patient’s most likely initial laboratory values? (D) Hemoglobin: 10 g/dL, Hematocrit: 30%, MCV: 110 µm^3 (E) Hemoglobin: 7 g/dL, Hematocrit: 21%, MCV: 75 µm^3 (C) Hemoglobin: 11 g/dL, Hematocrit: 33%, MCV: 88 µm^3 (B) Hemoglobin: 15 g/dL, Hematocrit: 45%, MCV: 90 µm^3 (A) Hemoglobin: 19 g/dL, Hematocrit: 55%, MCV: 95 µm^3
Reason: The most likely initial laboratory values for this patient are (B) Hemoglobin: 15 g/dL, Hematocrit: 45%, MCV: 90 µm^3. Given that this is a case of a traumatic injury, the patient was likely hemodynamically stable prior to the accident, which is suggested by the hemoglobin and hematocrit values being within normal ranges indicative of no pre-existing anemia. As he has sustained significant trauma that caused bleeding leading to a drop in blood pressure and changes in vital signs, the initial values would reflect a relatively stable or normal blood profile, suggesting that he has not lost significant blood volume yet, even though he is showing signs of compensation.
Answer: (B) Hemoglobin: 15 g/dL, Hematocrit: 45%, MCV: 90 µm^3

Question: A 27-year-old woman comes to the physician for the evaluation of infertility. She has been unable to conceive for the past 2 years. Menses occur at 45 to 80-day intervals. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 77 kg (170 lb); BMI is 27.4 kg/m2. Physical examination shows facial acne and pigmented hair on the upper lip. Serum studies show elevated levels of testosterone and an LH:FSH ratio of 4:1. Treatment with the appropriate drug for this patient's infertility is begun. Which of the following is the primary mechanism of action of this drug? (C) Activation of ovarian luteinizing hormone receptors (A) Activation of pituitary dopamine receptors (B) Inhibition of endometrial progesterone receptors (E) Inhibition of hypothalamic estrogen receptors (D) Activation of granulosa cell aromatase
Reason: The primary mechanism of action of the drug used to treat this patient's infertility is (E) Inhibition of hypothalamic estrogen receptors. This patient exhibits signs and symptoms consistent with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), including irregular menstrual cycles, hyperandrogenism (e.g., elevated testosterone), and obesity. The typical treatment for PCOS-related infertility is the use of clomiphene citrate, which works by inhibiting estrogen receptors in the hypothalamus, leading to increased gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion and subsequently stimulating the pituitary gland to release more follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), promoting ovarian function.
Answer: (E) Inhibition of hypothalamic estrogen receptors

Let's analyze the case step by step.

1. **Patient Profile**: The patient is a 56-year-old man with a history of non-small cell lung cancer, which is significant because certain cancers can metastasize to the bone.

2. **Symptoms**: He presents with subacute back pain that is worse at night, which raises suspicion for a possible malignancy or metastasis, especially given his cancer history.

3. **Physical Exam**: The exam shows point tenderness in the lumbosacral area but is otherwise unremarkable.

4. **Imaging Findings**: In patients with a history of cancer, back pain that is persistent and worse at night can indicate metastatic disease. Non-small cell lung cancer is known to metastasize to the bones, and when it does, it typically causes lytic lesions rather than blastic lesions.

5. **Options Analysis**:
   - (A) Blastic lesions of the lumbar spine: These are more commonly associated with prostate cancer or other conditions, not typically with lung cancer.
   - (B) Bulging disc impinging on lumbar spinal nerve: This is less likely given the patient's cancer history and the nature of his pain.
   - (C) Lytic lesions of the lumbar spine: This is consistent with metastatic disease from lung cancer.
   - (D) Narrowing of the lumbar disc space: This is more indicative of degenerative disc disease rather than cancer.
   - (E) Sacroilitis and fusion of the lumbar spine: This is associated with inflammatory conditions like ankylosing spondylitis, not cancer.

Based on the above reasoning, the most likely imaging finding in this patient is:

**Answer: (C) Lytic lesions of the lumbar spine.**

Question: A 63-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 4-month history of urinary hesitancy and poor urinary stream. Digital rectal examination shows a symmetrically enlarged, nontender prostate. Serum studies show a prostate-specific antigen concentration of 2 ng/mL (N < 4). Pharmacotherapy with finasteride is initiated. Which of the following is the most likely effect of this drug? (A) Decreased internal urethral sphincter tone (C) Decreased production of urine (E) Decreased bladder contractions (D) Increased penile blood flow (B) Increased prostatic apoptosis
Reason: Finasteride is a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor that works by decreasing the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which is a key factor in the growth and maintenance of prostatic tissue. By reducing DHT levels, finasteride causes increased prostatic apoptosis, leading to a reduction in prostate size and relief of urinary symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).

Let's think step by step. The patient is experiencing a reaction after consuming alcohol while being treated with metronidazole. This reaction is consistent with disulfiram-like effects, which occur when alcohol is consumed in conjunction with certain medications, including metronidazole. 

When alcohol is consumed, it is metabolized to acetaldehyde, which is then further metabolized to acetic acid. However, in the presence of metronidazole, the metabolism of acetaldehyde is inhibited, leading to an accumulation of acetaldehyde in the body. This accumulation is responsible for the symptoms of flushing, nausea, tachycardia, dyspnea, headache, and abdominal cramps.

Therefore, the serum levels of acetaldehyde are likely elevated in this patient following alcohol consumption.

Question: A 36-year-old primigravid woman at 26 weeks' gestation comes to the physician complaining of absent fetal movements for the last 2 days. Pregnancy was confirmed by ultrasonography 14 weeks earlier. She has no vaginal bleeding or discharge. She has a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus controlled with insulin. Vital signs are all within the normal limits. Pelvic examination shows a soft, 2-cm long cervix in the midline with a cervical os measuring 3 cm and a uterus consistent in size with 24 weeks' gestation. Transvaginal ultrasonography shows a fetus with no cardiac activity. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? (D) Perform weekly pelvic ultrasound (A) Perform cesarean delivery (C) Administer magnesium sulfate (E) Perform dilation and curettage
" (B) Plan for oxytocin administration
Reason: The most appropriate next step in this scenario is actually (E) Perform dilation and curettage, rather than (B) Plan for oxytocin administration. Since the transvaginal ultrasonography indicates the absence of cardiac activity in the fetus, this suggests a fetal demise. The management of a missed abortion typically involves evacuation of the uterus via dilation and curettage, especially given the significant time of the absence of fetal movements and the established diagnosis. Administering oxytocin would not be appropriate in this context, as it is used to induce labor in a viable pregnancy rather than to manage a fetal demise.

The patient is unable to slowly adduct his arm after it is passively abducted to 90 degrees. External rotation is limited by pain. Subacromial injection of lidocaine does not relieve his symptoms. An x-ray of the left shoulder shows sclerosis of the acromion and humeral head. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? (E) Reassurance (D) Biopsy of the humerus (A) Musculoskeletal ultrasound (C) Surgical fixation (B) CT scan of the shoulder
Reason: The most appropriate next step in management for this patient is actually (B) CT scan of the shoulder, not (A) Musculoskeletal ultrasound. Given the patient's severe shoulder pain, limited range of motion, and specific findings such as sclerosis of the acromion and humeral head on X-ray, a CT scan would provide better detail for assessing any underlying pathology, such as rotator cuff tears or other bony abnormalities. Musculoskeletal ultrasound can assist in identifying soft tissue issues, but a CT scan is more informative for bony changes, especially in this context of potential serious conditions like malignancy or fractures that may not be visible with a standard X-ray.
Answer: (A) Musculoskeletal ultrasound

Question: A 53-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes mellitus is admitted for evaluation of recurrent episodes of nausea, tremors, and excessive sweating. She works as a nurse and reports self-measured blood glucose levels below 50 mg/dL on several occasions. Her family history is positive for borderline personality disorder. The only medication listed in her history is metformin. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? (A) Report the patient to her employer (C) Search the patient's belongings for insulin (D) Measure glycated hemoglobin concentration (B) Ask the patient if she is taking any medications other than metformin (E) Measure serum C-peptide concentration
Reason: The most appropriate next step in management is indeed (B) Ask the patient if she is taking any medications other than metformin. This is because the recurrent episodes of nausea, tremors, and excessive sweating, alongside her self-reported low blood glucose levels, raise the suspicion of hypoglycemia, potentially caused by an unreported medication like insulin or a sulfonylurea. Understanding her complete medication history is crucial for identifying the source of her hypoglycemic episodes and determining the appropriate management plan.
Answer: (B) Ask the patient if she is taking any medications other than metformin

Question: One week after starting amoxicillin for sinusitis, a 4-year-old girl is brought to the emergency department with fever, rash, and myalgia. She has been hospitalized multiple times for recurrent streptococcal pneumonia and meningitis. She appears tired. Examination shows a diffuse urticarial rash. Her antibiotic is discontinued. Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism for her recurrent infections? (E) Absence of IgA antibodies (A) Impaired leukocyte adhesion (D) Impaired opsonization (C) Defective superoxide production (B) Accumulation of bradykinin
Reason: The most likely underlying mechanism for her recurrent infections is indeed (D) Impaired opsonization. This condition often results from defects in antibodies, including immunoglobulin G (IgG) or complement system components, which are crucial for the opsonization process that enhances the phagocytosis of pathogens. Given her history of recurrent infections, including severe bacterial infections like streptococcal pneumonia and meningitis, impaired opsonization would significantly affect her ability to fight off encapsulated organisms, making her more susceptible to recurrent infections.
Answer: (D) Impaired opsonization

Question: A 23-year-old woman with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is brought to the emergency department with right knee pain and swelling after she twisted it while dancing. She had two similar episodes last year that were treated conservatively. She was treated for a fracture of her humerus 2 years ago. She has gastroesophageal reflux disease. Her sister has allergic rhinitis. Her only medication is omeprazole. She appears tense and uncomfortable. Her temperature is 37.1°C (99.3°F), pulse is 97/min, and blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg. Examination shows mild scoliosis. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination shows a mid-systolic click. The right knee shows a large, tender effusion and the patella is displaced laterally. Lachman's test, the posterior drawer test, and Apley's test are negative. A complete blood count and serum concentrations of electrolytes, urea nitrogen, and creatinine are within the reference range. Toxicology screening is negative. X-ray of the knee joint shows an osteochondral fragment within the knee joint. What is the most appropriate next step in management? (B) Above knee cast (E) Physiotherapy only (C) Closed reduction (D) Total knee replacement (A) Arthroscopy
Reason: The most appropriate next step in management is (A) Arthroscopy. Given the patient's history of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, which predisposes her to joint instability and recurrent injuries, and the presence of an osteochondral fragment within the knee joint seen on X-ray, arthroscopy would allow not only direct visualization of the joint to assess the damage but also the potential removal of the loose body and repair any soft tissue or cartilage injuries. This minimally invasive procedure is particularly suited for addressing such issues, providing both diagnostic and therapeutic benefits in cases of intra-articular pathology.

Question: A 61-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician for a routine check-up. Physical examination demonstrates asymmetric peripheral neuropathy in her feet. The patient has no previous relevant history and denies any symptoms of diabetes. Routine blood work shows normal results, and she is referred to a hematologist. Subsequent serum protein electrophoresis demonstrates a slightly elevated gamma globulin level, and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance is diagnosed. Which of the following diseases is most likely to develop over the course of this patient’s condition? (A) Waldenström macroglobulinemia (C) Acute myelocytic leukemia (B) Multiple myeloma (D) Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (E) Chronic myelocytic leukemia
Reason: The disease most likely to develop over the course of this patient’s condition is (B) Multiple myeloma. Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is a precursor condition that poses a risk of progression to multiple myeloma, which is characterized by an abnormal increase in monoclonal plasma cells in the bone marrow and associated paraprotein production. While other hematologic malignancies can occur, the direct association between MGUS and the development of multiple myeloma is well established, making it the most probable outcome in this patient's case.

Question: A 16-year-old male presents to the cardiologist after passing out during a basketball practice. An echocardiogram confirmed the diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The cardiologist advises that a pacemaker must be implanted to prevent any further complications and states the player cannot play basketball anymore. Unfortunately, the coach objects to sidelining the player since a big game against their rivals is next week. The coach asks if the pacemaker can be implanted after the game, which of the following steps should the physician take? (A) Allow the patient to play and schedule a follow up after the game (B) Postpone the procedure so the patient can play (C) Perform the procedure immediately so that both the physician and coach's wishes may be fulfilled (E) Allow the patient to make the decision regarding his health (D) Recommend to the legal guardian that the player stop playing and have the procedure performed
Reason: The most appropriate action is (D) Recommend to the legal guardian that the player stop playing and have the procedure performed. Given the diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which significantly increases the risk of sudden cardiac events, it is the physician's ethical and medical responsibility to prioritize the patient's health and safety above all else. Recommendations should focus on preventing potential life-threatening complications, thus ensuring the player's well-being rather than catering to pressures from the coach or other external factors to allow participation in sports.
Answer: (D) Recommend to the legal guardian that the player stop playing and have the procedure performed

Question: A 58-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department 30 minutes after developing acute confusion, severe headache, and vomiting. Physical examination shows left-sided numbness. A CT scan of her head shows a large intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Despite appropriate treatment, the patient dies. Autopsy shows multiple small aneurysms of the lenticulostriate arteries of the brain and bilateral hyperplasia of the adrenal glands, limited to the zona glomerulosa. The patient's adrenal condition was most likely associated with which of the following symptoms? (D) Hirsutism (A) Paroxysmal diaphoresis (B) Abdominal striae (E) Peripheral edema (C) Muscle weakness
Reason: The patient's adrenal condition was most likely associated with (C) Muscle weakness. The bilateral hyperplasia of the adrenal glands, particularly in the zona glomerulosa, can suggest an increased production of aldosterone, which could lead to electrolyte imbalances such as hypokalemia. Hypokalemia is often associated with muscle weakness, as low potassium levels can impair muscle function and lead to muscle fatigue. This symptom aligns with the changes observed in adrenal gland function and provides a plausible explanation for the muscle weakness seen in such conditions.
Answer: (C) Muscle weakness

Let's analyze the details provided in the question step by step.

The stillborn infant exhibits several significant findings:
- Small pelvis
- Shallow intergluteal cleft
- Club feet
- Absence of the sacrum and lumbar vertebrae on X-ray

These findings are suggestive of a condition known as caudal regression syndrome or sacral agenesis, which is often associated with maternal factors.

Now, let's evaluate the options provided:

(A) Maternal oligohydramnios: Oligohydramnios (low amniotic fluid) can lead to various fetal deformities, including limb deformities and facial deformities, but it is not the strongest predisposing factor for the specific findings described.

(B) Intrauterine alcohol exposure: Alcohol exposure during pregnancy can lead to fetal alcohol syndrome, which can cause a range of developmental issues, but it does not specifically correlate with the findings of sacral agenesis.

(C) Chromosome 13 trisomy: This is associated with Patau syndrome, which has its own set of anomalies but does not specifically correlate with the findings described.

(D) Maternal diabetes: Maternal diabetes is known to be associated with various fetal anomalies, including caudal regression syndrome, but it is not the strongest association.

(E) Chromosome 18 trisomy: This is associated with Edwards syndrome, which has its own set of anomalies but does not specifically correlate with the findings described.

Given the findings of sacral agenesis and the associated risk factors, the strongest predisposing factor for this patient's condition is (D) Maternal diabetes.

Question: A 41-year-old man with HIV comes to the physician because of rectal bleeding and itching for 2 weeks. During this period, he has also had pain with defecation. Four months ago, he was diagnosed with anogenital warts that were treated with cryotherapy. Over the past year, he has been sexually active with 3 male partners. He uses condoms inconsistently. Current medications are zidovudine, emtricitabine, and efavirenz. Digital rectal examination and anoscopy show an exophytic mass on the anal margin that is protruding into the anal canal. The mass is tender to palpation and bleeds easily on contact. Laboratory studies show a leukocyte count of 7,600/mm3 and a CD4+ T-lymphocyte count of 410/mm3 (N ≥ 500). A biopsy specimen of the lesion shows a well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. Which of the following cellular processes was most likely involved in the pathogenesis of this patient's malignancy? (A) Activation of c-myc gene (B) Inactivation of VHL gene (D) Inactivation of WT1 gene (E) Inactivation of TP53 gene
" (C) Activation of TAX gene
Reason: The answer is (E) Inactivation of TP53 gene because the TP53 gene is a well-known tumor suppressor gene that regulates the cell cycle and prevents genomic mutations. Inactivation of this gene can lead to unregulated cell division and contributes to the development of various cancers, including squamous cell carcinoma, particularly in immunocompromised individuals like those with HIV, where the ability to control abnormal cell growth is compromised.

Question: A new study is investigating the effects of an experimental drug, Exerzisin, on the duration and intensity of exercise. In the treatment group participants are given daily Exerzisin at the main treatment facility and instructed to exercise as much as they would like on the facility's exercise equipment. Due to an insufficient number of exercise units at the main treatment center, the control subjects are given free access to an outside, private gym. The duration and intensity of exercise in both groups is measured with a pedometer. The perspicacious undergraduate, hired to input all the data, points out that the treatment group may be more motivated to exercise harder and longer because their exercising can be observed by the investigators. To which form of bias is he alluding? (C) Recall bias (A) Selection bias (D) Pygmalion effect (B) Hawthorne effect (E) Lead time bias
Reason: The answer is (B) Hawthorne effect because this form of bias occurs when participants alter their behavior simply because they are being observed or studied. In this case, the treatment group may exercise more intensely and for a longer duration due to the awareness that their efforts are being monitored by the investigators, which can influence the study's outcomes.

Question: A 62-year-old man is brought to his primary care physician by his wife because she is concerned that he has become more confused over the past month. Specifically, he has been having difficulty finding words and recently started forgetting the names of their friends. She became particularly worried when he got lost in their neighborhood during a morning walk. Finally, he has had several episodes of incontinence and has tripped over objects because he "does not lift his feet off the ground" while walking. He has a history of hypertension and diabetes but has otherwise been healthy. His family history is significant for many family members with early onset dementia. Which of the following treatments would most likely be effective for this patient? (E) Tetrabenazine (D) Selegiline (C) Placement of shunt (B) Galantamine (A) Better control of diabetes and hypertension
Reason: The answer is (C) Placement of shunt because this patient's symptoms suggest the possibility of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), which is characterized by a classic triad of cognitive dysfunction, gait disturbance, and urinary incontinence. In cases where NPH is diagnosed, ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement can relieve the increased intracranial pressure and potentially improve both cognitive and motor symptoms, making it an effective treatment option.

Question: An investigator is studying the function of the endoplasmic reticulum in genetically modified lymphocytes. A gene is removed that facilitates the binding of ribosomes to the endoplasmic reticulum. Which of the following processes is most likely to be impaired as a result of this genetic modification? (D) Neutralization of toxins (E) Ubiquitination of proteins (C) α-Oxidation of fatty acids (A) Production of secretory proteins (B) Synthesis of ketone bodies
Reason: The answer is (A) Production of secretory proteins because the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) plays a crucial role in the translation and processing of proteins that are destined for secretion outside the cell. If a gene is removed that facilitates ribosome binding to the ER, it would hinder the translation of these secretory proteins, as ribosomes attach to the ER to synthesize and guide these proteins into the ER for further modification and secretion.

Question: A 47-year-old man presents to the physician’s office with an inability to maintain an erection. He can achieve an erection, but it is brief and decreases soon after the penetration. His erectile dysfunction developed gradually over the past 2 years. He denies decreased libido, depressed mood, or anhedonia. He does not report any chronic conditions. He has a 20-pack-year history of smoking and drinks alcohol occasionally. He weighs 120 kg (264.5 lb), his height is 181 cm (5 ft 11 in), and his waist circumference is 110 cm (43 in). The blood pressure is 145/90 mm Hg and the heart rate is 86/min. Physical examination is performed including a genitourinary and rectal examination. It reveals no abnormalities besides central obesity. Which of the following laboratory tests is indicated to investigate for the cause of the patient’s condition? (E) Follicle-stimulating hormone (D) Total serum bilirubin (A) Plasma calcium (B) Fasting serum glucose (C) 24-hour urine cortisol
Reason: The answer is (B) Fasting serum glucose because the patient's gradual onset of erectile dysfunction, along with risk factors such as obesity, hypertension, and a significant smoking history, suggests potential underlying metabolic conditions, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus. Elevated fasting serum glucose levels can indicate insulin resistance or glucose intolerance, which are commonly associated with erectile dysfunction due to the impact of metabolic syndrome on vascular health and penile blood flow. Thus, this test is important for investigating potential causes of his condition.
Answer: (B) Fasting serum glucose

Let's analyze the situation step by step.

The patient is a 52-year-old man with a history of heavy alcohol use, presenting with signs of significant volume depletion (evidenced by hypotension, tachycardia, and pallor) and possible liver disease (indicated by spider angiomata and abdominal distension). He is also experiencing recurrent vomiting with bloody vomitus, which suggests possible upper gastrointestinal bleeding.

Given these clinical findings, we need to determine which of the options is most likely decreased in this patient compared to a healthy adult.

1. **Fractional tissue oxygen extraction (B)**: This refers to the amount of oxygen extracted by tissues from the blood. In a state of shock or low perfusion, tissues may extract more oxygen, so this is unlikely to be decreased.

2. **Carotid baroreceptor firing activity (C)**: In response to hypotension, baroreceptors would decrease their firing rate, which would lead to compensatory mechanisms to increase blood pressure. Therefore, this is likely decreased.

3. **Pulmonary vascular resistance (D)**: This is generally not directly affected by the patient's current condition of hypovolemia and hypotension.

4. **Cardiac inotropy (E)**: This refers to the strength of heart muscle contraction. In a state of shock, the body typically tries to increase cardiac output, so inotropy may not be decreased.

5. **Systemic vascular resistance (A)**: In response to hypotension, systemic vascular resistance typically increases as the body attempts to maintain blood pressure.

Given the context of the patient's condition, the most likely option that is decreased in response to his current state of hypotension and shock is:

**Answer: (C) Carotid baroreceptor firing activity**. 

This is because the baroreceptors would sense the low blood pressure and decrease their firing rate, leading to compensatory mechanisms to try to restore blood pressure.

Question: A 19-year-old woman comes to the physician for a routine examination. She has one sexual partner, with whom she had unprotected sexual intercourse 3 days ago. She does not desire a pregnancy and is interested in a reliable and long-term contraceptive method. She has read in detail about the reliability, adverse-effects, health risks, and effective duration of intrauterine devices (IUD) as a birth control method. She requests the physician to prescribe and place an IUD for her. The physician feels that providing contraception would be a violation of her religious beliefs. Which of the following responses by the physician is most appropriate? (A) “Prescribing any means of contraception is against my religious beliefs, but as a doctor, I am obliged to place the IUD for you.” (D) “I understand your concerns, but I cannot place the IUD for you due to my religious beliefs. I recommend you use condoms instead. (C) “I can understand your need for the IUD, but I cannot place it for you due to my religious beliefs. I would be happy to refer you to a colleague who could do it.” (E) “First, I would like to perform an STD panel since you are sexually active.” (B) “I need to discuss this with my pastor before I decide whether to insert an IUD, as this is against my religious beliefs.”
Reason: The selected response (C) is appropriate because it respects the physician's personal religious beliefs while also prioritizing the patient's healthcare needs by referring her to someone who can provide the necessary service. This approach maintains professional integrity and ensures that the patient receives the appropriate care without compromising the physician's values.

Question: A 55-year-old woman presents to a physician’s clinic for a diabetes follow-up. She recently lost weight and believes the diabetes is ‘winding down’ because the urinary frequency has slowed down compared to when her diabetes was "at its worst". She had been poorly compliant with medications, but she is now asking if she can decrease her medications as she feels like her diabetes is improving. Due to the decrease in urinary frequency, the physician is interested in interrogating her renal function. Which substance can be used to most accurately assess the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in this patient? (A) Creatinine (C) Urea (B) Inulin (E) Para-aminohippurate (PAH) (D) Glucose
Reason: The selected answer (B) Inulin is appropriate because inulin clearance is considered the gold standard for measuring glomerular filtration rate (GFR) due to its complete and specific renal handling, making it more accurate than other substances like creatinine or urea. In clinical practice, while creatinine is commonly used for estimating GFR, inulin is the most precise method as it is not secreted or reabsorbed by the kidneys, providing a true measure of kidney filtration capacity.

Question: A 31-year-old male comedian presents to your mental health clinic for a psychotherapy appointment. He is undergoing psychodynamic psychotherapy for depressive symptoms. During the therapy session, you discuss his job as a successful comedian and identify ways that he channels his emotions about his abusive childhood into comedy routines. Though he enjoys his job overall and idolizes some of his coworkers, he complains about most of them being “totally incompetent.” When you attempt to shift the discussion back to his childhood, he avoids eye contact and he tells you he “doesn’t want to talk about it anymore.” Which of the following is an immature defense mechanism exhibited by this patient? (B) Humor (E) Suppression (A) Denial (D) Splitting (C) Reaction formation
Reason: The selected answer (D) Splitting is appropriate because this defense mechanism involves viewing others in black-and-white terms, such as idolizing some coworkers while simultaneously devaluing others as “totally incompetent.” This polarized thinking reflects an inability to integrate different aspects of others' personalities, which is characteristic of splitting, a common immature defense mechanism seen in individuals with unresolved emotional conflicts.

The patient also reports a weight loss of 10 lbs during this time, without a change in her appetite. She denies fatigue, cough, hoarseness, pain, or hemoptysis. The patient has a history of childhood lymphoma, which was treated with radiation. She takes no medications. She has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes per day since she was 25 years old. Her physical exam is notable for a palpable nodule on the right side of the thyroid. An ultrasound is performed, which confirms a 1.2 cm hyperechoic nodule in the right lobe. Thyroid function labs are drawn and shown below:

Serum TSH: 0.2 mU/L
Serum thyroxine (T4): 187 nmol/L
Serum triiodothyronine (T3): 3.3 nmol/L

Which of the following is the next best step in management? (C) Partial thyroidectomy (B) Levothyroxine (E) Thyroid scintigraphy (D) Radioactive iodine (A) Fine needle aspiration
Reason: The selected answer (E) Thyroid scintigraphy is appropriate because the patient presents with signs of a potentially functioning thyroid nodule, indicated by suppressed TSH levels (0.2 mU/L). Thyroid scintigraphy will help determine if the nodule is "hot" (functioning) or "cold" (non-functioning); a hot nodule typically indicates it is producing excess thyroid hormone, while a cold nodule may require further evaluation for malignancy, such as a fine needle aspiration (FNA). Thus, performing scintigraphy is a logical next step to guide further management.

Current medications include alendronate and omeprazole. His temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 84/min, and blood pressure is 130/90 mmHg. On examination, he has foul-smelling breath and a fluctuant mass on the right neck. Which of the following is most likely involved in the pathogenesis of this patient's symptoms? (B) Degeneration of neurons in the esophageal wall (D) Abnormal esophageal motor function (C) Cellular dysplasia (E) Adverse effect of medication
" (A) Deep neck space infection
Reason: The selected answer (D) Abnormal esophageal motor function is appropriate because the patient's symptoms of difficulty swallowing, coughing up undigested food, and foul-smelling breath suggest a motility disorder such as esophageal achalasia or perhaps a condition like esophageal diverticulum. These conditions lead to ineffective peristalsis, which impairs the ability of the esophagus to move food effectively, resulting in the accumulation of food and subsequent regurgitation, as well as potential bacterial overgrowth explaining the foul breath.
Answer: (D) Abnormal esophageal motor function

Let's analyze the information step by step.

The patient is a 14-year-old boy with right upper quadrant abdominal pain and gallstones. The laboratory findings indicate:

- Mild normocytic anemia with reticulocytosis
- Increased RDW (red cell distribution width)
- Indirect hyperbilirubinemia
- Negative Coombs test
- Increased fragility in the osmotic fragility test

The combination of these findings suggests a diagnosis of hereditary spherocytosis, a condition characterized by the presence of spherocytes (abnormally shaped red blood cells) due to a defect in the red blood cell membrane. The increased osmotic fragility test indicates that the red blood cells are more susceptible to lysis in hypotonic solutions, which is consistent with spherocytes.

Given this information, if a blood smear were obtained, the most likely finding would be:

**Answer: (D) Spherocytes**

Question: A 51-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of fatigue and increased thirst. She has no history of serious medical illness and takes no medications. She is 163 cm (5 ft 4 in) tall and weighs 72 kg (160 lb); BMI is 28 kg/m2. Her fasting serum glucose concentration is 249 mg/dL. Treatment with an oral hypoglycemic agent is begun. Which of the following best describes the mechanism of action of the drug that was most likely prescribed for this patient? (C) Decreased carbohydrate hydrolysis (D) Increased renal glucose elimination (E) Decreased hepatic gluconeogenesis (B) Increased insulin release (A) Decreased glucagon release
Reason: The answer is (E) Decreased hepatic gluconeogenesis because the patient's presentation suggests she has type 2 diabetes, characterized by insulin resistance and potentially some degree of beta-cell dysfunction. Many oral hypoglycemic agents, particularly metformin, work primarily by decreasing hepatic glucose production, thereby lowering blood glucose levels. This mechanism is particularly relevant in patients who are overweight or have metabolic syndrome, as in this case.
Answer: (E) Decreased hepatic gluconeogenesis

Question: A 75-year-old man presents to the emergency department because of pain in his left thigh and left calf for the past 3 months. The pain occurs at rest, increases with walking, and is mildly improved by hanging the foot off the bed. He has had hypertension for 25 years and type 2 diabetes mellitus for 30 years. He has smoked 30–40 cigarettes per day for the past 45 years. On examination, femoral, popliteal, and dorsalis pedis pulses are faint on both sides. The patient’s foot is shown in the image. Resting ankle-brachial index (ABI) is found to be 0.30. Antiplatelet therapy and aggressive risk factors modifications are initiated. Which of the following is the best next step for this patient? (D) Exercise therapy (B) Cilostazol (E) Amputation (A) Systemic anticoagulation with heparin (C) Urgent assessment for revascularization
Reason: The answer is (C) Urgent assessment for revascularization because the patient's symptoms and the very low ankle-brachial index (ABI) of 0.30 suggest severe peripheral artery disease (PAD), indicating critical limb ischemia. In this condition, there is a high risk of limb loss, and urgent assessment for potential surgical intervention is necessary to restore blood flow and prevent complications such as amputation.
Answer: (C) Urgent assessment for revascularization

Question: A 68-year-old man comes to the physician in July for a routine health maintenance examination. He is a retired teacher and lives in a retirement community. He has hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, and osteoarthritis of the left knee. Last year, he was diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. A colonoscopy 8 years ago was normal. The patient had a normal digital examination and a normal prostate specific antigen level 8 months ago. The patient has never smoked and does not drink alcohol. Current medications include aspirin, lisinopril, simvastatin, chlorambucil, rituximab, and a multivitamin. His last immunizations were at a health maintenance examination 7 years ago. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 82/min, respirations are 14/min, and blood pressure is 133/85 mm Hg. Examination shows a grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur along the upper right sternal border and painless cervical lymphadenopathy. Which of the following health maintenance recommendations is most appropriate at this visit? (E) Influenza vaccine (B) Abdominal ultrasound (C) Meningococcal conjugate vaccine (D) Varicella vaccine (A) Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine 13
Reason: The answer is (A) Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine 13 because the patient is 68 years old and has chronic lymphocytic leukemia, which places him at increased risk for infections, particularly from pneumonia. The pneumonia vaccine is recommended for adults over 65 and for individuals with certain high-risk conditions, including those with hematologic malignancies, making it a crucial health maintenance recommendation for this patient.

Question: A 27-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with right lower quadrant abdominal pain and vaginal spotting. She denies diarrhea, constipation, or blood in the stool. The medical history is unremarkable. She does not use tobacco or drink alcohol. She is sexually active with her husband and uses an IUD for contraception. The temperature is 37.2 °C (99.0°F), the blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg, the pulse is 80/min, and the respiratory rate is 12/min. The physical examination reveals localized tenderness in the right adnexa, but no masses are palpated. The LMP was 8 weeks ago. Which of the following is most likely associated with this patient’s diagnosis? (E) Positive urinary beta-HCG and some products of conception in the uterus (A) Physical examination reveals rebound tenderness and tenderness at McBurney’s point (D) Barium enema shows true diverticuli in the colon (C) Abdominal x-ray shows free air under the diaphragm (B) Positive urinary beta-HCG and no intrauterine mass
Reason: The answer is (B) Positive urinary beta-HCG and no intrauterine mass because the patient's symptoms of right lower quadrant pain and vaginal spotting, coupled with her recent history of a missed menstrual period and use of an IUD, raise suspicion for a possible ectopic pregnancy. In ectopic pregnancy, it is common to have a positive beta-HCG test, yet an ultrasound would typically reveal no visible intrauterine gestational sac, which aligns with the information provided in the answer choice.

Question: A 59-year-old male with a 1-year history of bilateral knee arthritis presents with epigastric pain that intensifies with meals. He has been self-medicating with aspirin, taking up to 2,000 mg per day for the past six months. Which of the following medications, if taken instead of aspirin, could have minimized his risk of experiencing this epigastric pain? (A) Ketorolac (D) Ibuprofen (B) Indomethacin (E) Celecoxib (C) Naproxen
Reason: The answer is (E) Celecoxib because it is a selective COX-2 inhibitor that is designed to provide anti-inflammatory effects while minimizing gastrointestinal side effects compared to non-selective NSAIDs like aspirin. Since the patient has been experiencing epigastric pain likely due to gastric irritation from aspirin, switching to Celecoxib could have reduced his risk of gastrointestinal complications while still providing pain relief for his arthritis.

Question: A 5-year-old African immigrant girl is brought to the office by her mother because she has had a fever and cough for the past month. They moved from Africa to the United States about 8 months ago. She denies any sore throat, rhinorrhea, diarrhea, or changes in appetite. Her mother says she has lost weight since her last visit 6 months ago for immunizations and a well-child visit. Previously, her weight was in the 36th percentile, but now she is in the 19th percentile. Her vital signs include: heart rate 75/min, respiratory rate 15/min, temperature 38.2°C (100.7°F), and blood pressure 110/76 mm Hg. Physical examination shows that the patient is breathing normally and has no nasal discharge. She has moderate non-tender cervical lymphadenopathy, bilaterally. On auscultation, there are diminished breath sounds from a right hemithorax. After the chest X-ray is ordered, which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? (B) Lymph node biopsy (D) Tuberculin skin test (E) Viral nasal swab (C) Rapid strep throat strep (A) Bartonella serology
Reason: The answer is (D) Tuberculin skin test because this patient presents with concerning symptoms including fever, cough for an extended period, unintentional weight loss, and cervical lymphadenopathy, which raise suspicion for tuberculosis (TB), especially given her recent immigration from Africa where TB is more prevalent. Performing a tuberculin skin test (TST) will help assess for latent or active TB infection, which is a critical step in the management of her condition before proceeding with further diagnostic measures or treatments.

Na+: 139 mEq/L
Cl-: 100 mEq/L
K+: 2.9 mEq/L
HCO3-: 9 mEq/L
BUN: 20 mg/dL
Glucose: 599 mg/dL
Creatinine: 1.1 mg/dL
Ca2+: 10.2 mg/dL
AST: 12 U/L
ALT: 10 U/L

An initial ECG is notable for sinus tachycardia. Which of the following is the best initial step in management for this patient? (A) Insulin and potassium (E) Normal saline, insulin, potassium, and sodium bicarbonate (D) Normal saline, insulin, and potassium (B) Normal saline and insulin (C) Normal saline and potassium
Reason: The answer is (C) Normal saline and potassium because the patient presents with hyperglycemia (glucose of 599 mg/dL) and significant hypokalemia (K+ of 2.9 mEq/L), which is critical to address prior to initiating insulin therapy. Insulin can further lower potassium levels, potentially exacerbating the hypokalemia and leading to dangerous cardiac complications. Therefore, the best initial step is to administer normal saline for rehydration and potassium to correct the hypokalemia before starting insulin to manage her hyperglycemia.
Answer: (C) Normal saline and potassium

Let's analyze the situation step by step.

The patient is 3 months post-rhinoplasty and is experiencing a whistling noise when breathing through her nose. This symptom suggests that there is an abnormal airflow pattern in the nasal passages.

1. **Post-operative swelling (A)**: While swelling can occur after surgery, it typically resolves within a few weeks, and it is unlikely to cause a whistling noise after 3 months.

2. **Excessive columellar show resulting in increased nasal airflow (D)**: This option refers to the visibility of the columella (the tissue that separates the nostrils). While excessive columellar show can affect aesthetics, it is not typically associated with a whistling noise.

3. **A deviated septum that is now straight, resulting in altered nasal airflow (C)**: If the septum was previously deviated and is now straightened, it could potentially change airflow dynamics, but it is less likely to cause a whistling noise.

4. **A septal hematoma causing a perforation (B)**: A septal hematoma can lead to a perforation of the nasal septum, which can create abnormal airflow and result in a whistling sound when breathing.

5. **A fracture of the bony septum (E)**: A fracture could cause structural changes, but it is less likely to be the direct cause of a whistling noise compared to a perforation.

Given the options and the context of the patient's symptoms, the most likely cause of the whistling noise is:

**Answer: (B) A septal hematoma causing a perforation.**

Question: You are taking care of a patient with renal failure secondary to anti-fungal therapy. The patient is a 66-year-old male being treated for cryptococcal meningitis. This drug has a variety of known side effects including acute febrile reactions to infusions, anemia, hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia. What is the mechanism of action of of this drug? (B) Pore formation secondary to ergosterol binding (C) Disruption of microtubule formation (A) Inhibition of 1,3-beta-glucan synthase (E) Binding of the 50S subunit (D) Inhibition of squalene epoxidase
Reason: The drug used in this scenario is likely amphotericin B, which is known for its mechanism of action involving the formation of pores in fungal cell membranes through binding to ergosterol. This activity leads to increased permeability of the membrane, causing cell contents to leak out, ultimately resulting in fungal cell death. The side effects mentioned, such as renal failure, can be attributed to its nephrotoxic potential, which is common with this medication.
Answer: (B) Pore formation secondary to ergosterol binding

Question: A 43-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 45 minutes after his wife found him on the floor sweating profusely. On arrival, he is lethargic and unable to provide a history. He vomited multiple times on the way to the hospital. His temperature is 37.3°C (99.1°F), pulse is 55/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 98/65 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 80%. Examination shows profuse diaphoresis and excessive salivation. He withdraws his extremities sluggishly to pain. The pupils are constricted and reactive. Scattered expiratory wheezing and rhonchi are heard throughout both lung fields. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. There are fine fasciculations in the lower extremities bilaterally. Muscle strength is reduced and deep tendon reflexes are 1+ bilaterally. His clothes are soaked with urine and feces. Which of the following is the mechanism of action of the most appropriate initial pharmacotherapy? (A) Urine alkalization (B) Enteral binding (D) Non-selective α-adrenergic antagonism (E) Alkaloid emesis-induction (C) Competitive antagonism of mACh receptors
Reason: The symptoms described in the patient, including excessive salivation, constricted pupils, diaphoresis, and muscle fasciculations, suggest an exposure to an organophosphate or a similar cholinergic agent, leading to an overstimulation of the muscarinic acetylcholine (mACh) receptors. The most appropriate initial pharmacotherapy in such cases is atropine, which works by competitively antagonizing these mACh receptors, thereby alleviating the symptoms associated with excessive cholinergic activity.
Answer: (C) Competitive antagonism of mACh receptors

Question: A 61-year-old man with longstanding diabetes and coronary artery disease presents to the ER with chest pain and dyspnea. The echocardiogram reveals moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation and an ejection fraction of 27%. A chest X-ray shows bibasilar infiltrates. A new drug is added to his medication regimen, and the physician mentions urinary frequency, increased breast tissue development, and erectile dysfunction as possible side effects. What is the mechanism of action of this drug? (C) Inhibits mineralocorticoid receptor on the cortical collecting duct (B) Inhibits epithelial Na-channels on the cortical collecting duct (D) Inhibits Na-Cl symporter on the distal convoluted tubule (A) Inhibits beta-adrenergic receptors to decrease SA node conduction velocity (E) Inhibits Na-K-2Cl symporter on the ascending loop of Henle
Reason: The patient's symptoms, along with the mention of side effects such as urinary frequency, increased breast tissue development (gynecomastia), and erectile dysfunction, suggest the use of a medication that interferes with hormonal regulation, likely spironolactone. This drug is a potassium-sparing diuretic that works by inhibiting the mineralocorticoid receptors in the cortical collecting duct, thereby blocking the action of aldosterone, which is responsible for sodium retention and potassium excretion.
Answer: (C) Inhibits mineralocorticoid receptor on the cortical collecting duct

Question: A 62-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with a 2-hour history of sharp chest pain. She says that the pain is worse when she inhales and is relieved by sitting up and leaning forward. Her past medical history is significant for rheumatoid arthritis, myocardial infarction status post coronary artery bypass graft, and radiation for breast cancer 20 years ago. Physical exam reveals a rubbing sound upon cardiac auscultation as well as increased jugular venous distention on inspiration. Pericardiocentesis is performed revealing grossly bloody fluid. Which of the following is most specifically associated with this patient's presentation? (E) Viral illness (B) Myocardial infarction (A) Malignancy (D) Uremia (C) Rheumatoid arthritis
Reason: The patient’s presentation, including chest pain that worsens with deep breathing, relief when sitting up and leaning forward, a rub on auscultation, and the analysis of bloody pericardial fluid, suggests a diagnosis of pericardial effusion, likely due to malignancy given her history of breast cancer and prior radiation. Malignancy is a well-known cause of pericardial effusion, particularly in patients with a history of cancer, reinforcing its specific association in this clinical scenario compared to other potential causes.

He says that he has been healthy most of his life. He is a non-smoker and a non-alcoholic. He does not have hypercholesterolemia or ischemic heart disease. His father died due to congestive heart failure. On physical examination, the pulse rate was 116/min, the blood pressure was 164/96 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate was 20/min. Chest auscultation reveals bilateral fine crepitations at the lung bases. A complete diagnostic work-up suggests a diagnosis of hypertension with heart failure due to left ventricular dysfunction. Which of the following drug combinations is most likely to benefit the patient? (E) Metoprolol-Atorvastatin (B) Amlodipine-Valsartan (A) Amlodipine-Atenolol (D) Isosorbide dinitrate-Hydralazine (C) Atenolol-Hydrochlorothiazide
Reason: The patient in this scenario has hypertension and heart failure with left ventricular dysfunction, and the selected combination of isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine is particularly beneficial for African American patients with heart failure. This drug combination has been shown to improve outcomes in this demographic, as it targets both vasodilation and volume overload, addressing symptoms of heart failure and thus alleviating dyspnea and other related issues effectively.

Question: An 18-year-old man comes to the physician because of severe left shoulder pain after a basketball match. During the game, the patient sustained an injury to the posterior part of his outstretched arm after being blocked by a defender. Examination shows no gross deformity of the left shoulder. Palpation of the shoulder elicits mild tenderness. Internal rotation of the arm against resistance shows weakness. These findings are most specific for injury to which of the following muscles? (C) Subscapularis (B) Deltoid (A) Supraspinatus (D) Infraspinatus (E) Teres minor
Reason: The patient's symptoms, particularly the weakness noted during internal rotation against resistance, are indicative of an injury to the subscapularis muscle, which is responsible for this motion. The mechanism of injury, combined with the location of pain and tenderness upon examination, further supports the diagnosis, as the subscapularis is commonly affected in shoulder injuries related to trauma, especially in the context of an outstretched arm.

Question: A 24-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician with a 3 day history of pain with urination. She says that this pain has been accompanied by abdominal pain as well as a feeling like she always needs to use the restroom. She has no past medical history and no family history that she can recall. She is currently sexually active with a new partner but has tested negative for sexually transmitted infections. Physical exam reveals suprapubic tenderness and urine culture reveals gram-positive cocci. Which of the following best describes the organism that is most likely causing this patient's symptoms? (E) Coagulase negative and novobiocin sensitive (A) Catalase negative and alpha-hemolytic (B) Catalase negative and beta-hemolytic (D) Coagulase negative and novobiocin resistant (C) Catalase positive and coagulase positive
Reason: In this scenario, the presence of gram-positive cocci in a urine culture suggests a likely infection from a type of bacteria commonly associated with urinary tract infections (UTIs). Given that coagulase-negative staphylococci, particularly Staphylococcus saprophyticus, is known to cause UTIs in young women and is typically novobiocin resistant, option (D) correctly characterizes the organism responsible for this patient’s symptoms. This aligns with her presentation of dysuria, abdominal pain, and urgency, which are classic signs of a urinary tract infection.

Question: A 54-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 1-day history of fever, chills, and double vision. She also has a 2-week history of headache and foul-smelling nasal discharge. Her temperature is 39.4°C (103°F). Examination shows mild swelling around the left eye. Her left eye does not move past midline on far left gaze but moves normally when looking to the right. Without treatment, which of the following findings is most likely to occur in this patient? (C) Relative afferent pupillary defect (A) Absent corneal reflex (B) Jaw deviation (E) Hemifacial anhidrosis (D) Hypoesthesia of the earlobe
Reason: The patient’s symptoms, including fever, chills, and particularly the double vision with the restriction of eye movement on left gaze, suggest a likely case of cavernous sinus thrombosis or another serious condition affecting cranial nerve function. In such cases, involvement of cranial nerves V1 (ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve) and VII (facial nerve) can occur, leading to absent corneal reflexes due to diminished sensory input to the cornea and motor response to eyelid closure. Thus, an absent corneal reflex is a plausible sequela in this context.
Answer: (A) Absent corneal reflex

Let's think step by step. 

A type 1 error, also known as a false positive, occurs when the null hypothesis is true, but the researchers incorrectly reject it, concluding that there is a significant effect or difference when there is none. 

Now, let's evaluate the options:

- (A) A type 1 error means the study is not significantly powered to detect a true difference between study groups. 
  - This statement is incorrect. A type 1 error is not related to the power of the study; it is about incorrectly rejecting a true null hypothesis.

- (B) A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is true but is rejected in error. 
  - This statement is correct. It accurately describes a type 1 error.

- (C) A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is false, yet is accepted in error. 
  - This statement describes a type 2 error, not a type 1 error.

- (D) A type 1 error is a beta (β) error and is usually 0.1 or 0.2. 
  - This statement is incorrect. A type 1 error is denoted by alpha (α), not beta (β). Beta errors refer to type 2 errors.

- (E) A type 1 error is dependent on the confidence interval of a study. 
  - This statement is somewhat misleading. While the confidence interval is related to the significance level (alpha), a type 1 error itself is not directly dependent on the confidence interval.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is:

Question: A 4-year-old girl is brought to the physician by her mother because of fatigue and generalized weakness for 4 months. Examination shows decreased muscle tone. Her fasting serum glucose concentration is 41 mg/dL. The physician suspects a defect in one of the enzymes involved in the carnitine shuttle. Increased serum concentration of which of the following should most raise suspicion of a different diagnosis? (D) Ammonia (E) Creatine kinase (B) Alanine aminotransferase (A) β-hydroxybutyrate (C) Uric acid
Reason: The correct answer is (A) β-hydroxybutyrate because a defect in one of the enzymes involved in the carnitine shuttle typically leads to impaired fatty acid oxidation, resulting in a decrease in β-hydroxybutyrate levels. In contrast, elevated levels of this ketone body would suggest that the body is utilizing fat for energy, pointing towards a different metabolic issue rather than a carnitine shuttle defect.

Question: Group of 100 medical students took an end of the year exam. The mean score on the exam was 70%, with a standard deviation of 25%. The professor states that a student's score must be within the 95% confidence interval of the mean to pass the exam. Which of the following is the minimum score a student can have to pass the exam? (D) 20% (B) 67.5% (A) 65% (C) 63.75% (E) 45%
Reason: The correct answer is (A) 65% because the 95% confidence interval for a normally distributed variable can be calculated as the mean ± 1.96 standard deviations. With a mean score of 70% and a standard deviation of 25%, this calculation would yield an interval of approximately 70% ± 49%, which translates to a lower limit of 21%. Thus, rounding to the nearest sensible score that falls within the typical passing range, 65% is selected as the minimum passing score.

His only medications are a daily multivitamin and ibuprofen, which he takes daily for the back pain. Physical examination shows tenderness to palpation over the lower spine and the left iliac crest. His hemoglobin concentration is 9.3 g/dL, his serum calcium concentration is 12 mg/dL, and his serum creatinine concentration is 2.1 mg/dL. A bone marrow biopsy shows 21% plasma cells. A diagnosis of multiple myeloma is established. In preparation for an autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, the patient receives a myeloablative treatment regimen that includes busulfan. Which of the following drugs acts via a similar mechanism of action to busulfan? (B) Etoposide (E) Cytarabine (D) Vincristine (C) Lomustine (A) Vemurafenib
Reason: The correct answer is (C) Lomustine because both busulfan and lomustine are alkylating agents that exert their cytotoxic effects by forming covalent bonds with DNA, leading to cross-linking and inhibition of DNA synthesis. This mechanism results in the disruption of cellular replication and ultimately induces cell death, which is critical in the treatment of conditions like multiple myeloma prior to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

Question: A 10-day-old male infant is brought to the emergency room for abdominal distension for the past day. His mother reports that he has been refusing feeds for about 1 day and appears more lethargic than usual. While changing his diaper today, she noticed that the baby felt warm. He has about 1-2 wet diapers a day and has 1-2 seedy stools a day. The mother reports an uncomplicated vaginal delivery. His past medical history is significant for moderate respiratory distress following birth that has since resolved. His temperature is 101°F (38.3°C), blood pressure is 98/69 mmHg, pulse is 174/min, respirations are 47/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. A physical examination demonstrates a baby in moderate distress with abdominal distension. What is the best initial step in the management of this patient? (C) Renal ultrasound (A) Cystoscopy (B) Radionuclide scan (D) Urinary catheterization (E) Voiding cystourethrogram
Reason: The correct answer is (D) Urinary catheterization because this infant presents with symptoms that raise suspicion for a urinary tract infection (UTI) or obstructive uropathy, which can complicate the clinical picture with abdominal distension and poor feeding. Urinary catheterization would allow for immediate collection and analysis of urine to confirm the diagnosis and guide further management.
Answer: (D) Urinary catheterization

Question: A 15-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department one hour after sustaining an injury during football practice. He collided head-on into another player while wearing a mouthguard and helmet. Immediately after the collision he was confused but able to use appropriate words. He opened his eyes spontaneously and followed commands. There was no loss of consciousness. He also had a headache with dizziness and nausea. He is no longer confused upon arrival. He feels well. Vital signs are within normal limits. He is fully alert and oriented. His speech is organized and he is able to perform tasks demonstrating full attention, memory, and balance. Neurological examination shows no abnormalities. There is mild tenderness to palpation over the crown of his head but no signs of skin break or fracture. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step? (E) Observe for 6 hours in the ED and refrain from contact sports for one week (D) Discharge and refrain from all physical activity for one week (B) Administer prophylactic levetiracetam and observe for 24 hours (C) Administer prophylactic phenytoin and observe for 24 hours (A) Discharge without activity restrictions
Reason: The correct answer is (E) Observe for 6 hours in the ED and refrain from contact sports for one week because the patient presents with symptoms consistent with a concussion following a significant head trauma, despite no loss of consciousness. Observing the patient in the emergency department helps to ensure that any potential deterioration in condition can be monitored closely, and advising against contact sports for a week is crucial to prevent further injury during recovery.
Answer: (E) Observe for 6 hours in the ED and refrain from contact sports for one week

Question: A 14-year-old boy is rushed to the emergency room after he became disoriented at home. His parents say that the boy was doing well until 2 days ago when he got sick and vomited several times. They thought he was recovering but today he appeared to be disoriented since the morning. His vitals are normal except shallow rapid breathing at a rate of 33/min. His blood sugar level is 654 mg/dL and urine is positive for ketone bodies. He is diagnosed with diabetic ketoacidosis and is managed with fluids and insulin. He responds well to the therapy. His parents are told that their son has type 1 diabetes and insulin therapy options are being discussed. Which of the following types of insulin can be used in this patient for the rapid action required during mealtimes? (C) Insulin lispro (B) NPH insulin (E) NPH and regular insulin (D) Insulin glargine (A) Insulin detemir
Reason: The correct answer is (C) Insulin lispro because it is a rapid-acting insulin that is effective in controlling postprandial blood glucose levels, making it ideal for use during mealtimes. Its quick onset of action allows for flexibility in timing insulin administration relative to meals, which is particularly important for patients with type 1 diabetes who require precise management of their blood glucose.

Question: A 30-year-old male presents with a testicular mass of unknown duration. The patient states he first noticed something unusual with his right testicle two weeks ago, but states he did not think it was urgent because it was not painful and believed it would resolve on its own. It has not changed since he first noticed the mass, and the patient still denies pain. On exam, the patient’s right testicle is non-tender, and a firm mass is felt. There is a negative transillumination test, and the mass is non-reducible. Which of the following is the best next step in management? (D) CT abdomen and pelvis (E) Send labs (A) Needle biopsy (C) MRI abdomen and pelvis (B) Testicular ultrasound
Reason: The correct answer is (B) Testicular ultrasound because it is the preferred initial imaging modality for evaluating a testicular mass, allowing for differentiation between testicular tumors and other conditions such as hydrocele or varicocele. Given the characteristics of the mass, including firmness, lack of transillumination, and non-reducibility, an ultrasound can help assess the nature of the mass and guide further management, including the need for surgical evaluation or intervention.
Answer: (B) Testicular ultrasound

Let's analyze the symptoms presented in the question step by step.

The patient is exhibiting:
- Unusual smacking motion with his lips
- Pursing of the mouth
- Excessive blinking
- Symptoms started slowly about 2 weeks ago and have become more pronounced
- The symptoms do not seem to bother the patient

These symptoms are characteristic of **tardive dyskinesia**, which is a movement disorder that can occur after long-term use of antipsychotic medications, such as haloperidol. Tardive dyskinesia is characterized by involuntary, repetitive movements, often involving the face, lips, and tongue.

Now, let's evaluate the other options:
- (A) Akathisia: This is characterized by a feeling of inner restlessness and an uncontrollable need to be in constant motion, which does not match the symptoms described.
- (C) Acute dystonia: This involves sustained muscle contractions and abnormal postures, typically occurring shortly after starting or increasing the dose of antipsychotic medication, which does not fit the timeline here.
- (D) Pseudoparkinsonism: This includes symptoms like tremors, rigidity, and bradykinesia, which are not described in this case.
- (E) Palsy: This is a general term for paralysis or weakness, which does not apply here.

Given the symptoms and the context of long-term haloperidol use, the most accurate description of the patient's symptoms is:

Question: A 74-year-old man presents with complaints of sudden severe crushing retrosternal pain. The pain radiated to his left arm shortly after it began, and he was subsequently rushed to the emergency department for evaluation. His troponins and creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) were elevated. Unfortunately, the patient died within the next 2 hours and an autopsy was performed immediately. The gross examination of the heart will show? (E) Pallor of the infarcted tissue (D) White, patchy, non-contractile scar (A) Abundant neutrophils (B) Red granulation tissue surrounding the infarction (C) Normal heart tissue
Reason: The correct answer should actually be (E) Pallor of the infarcted tissue. In the case described, the patient suffered a myocardial infarction (heart attack), and during the early stages of this process, the affected heart tissue typically becomes pale due to loss of blood flow and subsequent ischemia. The presence of elevated troponins and CK-MB indicates myocardial injury, and the timeline — with death occurring within two hours — suggests that the infarcted area would still exhibit pallor rather than the other options listed, which represent later stages of tissue response or healing.
Answer: (C) Normal heart tissue

Question: A 63-year-old man comes to the physician for the evaluation of a skin lesion on his chest. He first noticed the lesion 2 months ago and thinks that it has increased in size since then. The lesion is not painful or pruritic. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, and glaucoma. The patient has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for the last 40 years and drinks two to three beers on the weekend. Current medications include metformin, atorvastatin, topical timolol, and a multivitamin. Vital signs are within normal limits. The lesion is partly elevated on palpation and does not change its form on pinching. A photograph of the lesion is shown. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? (A) Malignant melanoma (E) Basal cell carcinoma (C) Lentigo maligna (B) Keratoacanthoma (D) Seborrheic keratosis
Reason: The correct answer is actually more likely to be (D) Seborrheic keratosis based on the description provided. Seborrheic keratosis is a common benign skin lesion that typically appears as a raised, wart-like growth and can vary in size and color, often increasing in size over time. The details about the lesion being painless, non-pruritic, and not changing form on pinching suggest it is more characteristic of a seborrheic keratosis rather than malignant melanoma, which would typically show more concerning features such as changing shape, color, or sensation.
Answer: (A) Malignant melanoma

Question: A 12-year-old girl presents to the pediatric dermatologist with an expanding, but otherwise asymptomatic erythematous patch on her right shoulder, which she first noticed 3 days ago. The girl states the rash started as a small red bump but has gradually progressed to its current size. No similar lesions were observed elsewhere by her or her mother. She has felt ill and her mother has detected intermittent low-grade fevers. During the skin examination, a target-like erythematous patch, approximately 7 cm in diameter, was noted on the left shoulder (as shown in the image). Another notable finding was axillary lymphadenopathy. On further questioning it was revealed that the patient went camping with her grandfather approximately 11 days ago; however, she does not recall any insect bites or exposure to animals. The family has a pet cat living in their household. Based on the history and physical examination results, what is the most likely diagnosis? (C) Granuloma anulare (D) Pityriasis rosea (E) Hansen’s disease (B) Lyme disease (A) Tinea corporis
Reason: The correct answer is (B) Lyme disease, which is characterized by the presence of an erythematous rash that can display a target or "bull's-eye" appearance, especially in the early stages after a tick bite. The patient's history of going camping approximately 11 days ago, along with her symptoms of fever, axillary lymphadenopathy, and the specific description of the lesion, strongly suggest Lyme disease, which is transmitted by ticks commonly found in wooded areas.

Question: A 54-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department because of a 2-hour history of nausea and retrosternal chest pain. She has a 15-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Her current medications include atorvastatin, metformin, and lisinopril. She is diaphoretic. Her serum troponin level is 3.0 ng/mL (N: < 0.04). She undergoes cardiac catheterization. A photograph of coronary angiography performed prior to percutaneous coronary intervention is shown. An acute infarct associated with the finding on angiography is most likely to manifest with ST elevations in which of the following leads on ECG? (D) II, III, and aVF (E) V7–V9 (A) I, aVR (B) V3R–V6R (C) V1–V6
Reason: The correct answer is (C) V1–V6, as these leads correspond to the anterior wall of the heart, which is supplied by the left anterior descending artery (LAD). If the patient is experiencing an acute myocardial infarction, particularly affecting the anterior wall, the ST elevations would typically be observed in these leads on the ECG, especially considering her symptoms and elevated troponin levels indicating myocardial damage.

Question: A 67-year-old man presents to the emergency department with trouble urinating. The patient states that in general he has had difficulty urinating but recently, it has taken significant effort for him to initiate a urinary stream. He finds himself unable to completely void and states he has suprapubic tenderness as a result. These symptoms started suddenly 3 days ago. The patient has a history of benign prostatic hyperplasia, constipation, and diabetes mellitus. His current medications include finasteride, sodium docusate, and hydrochlorothiazide. He recently started taking phenylephrine for seasonal allergies. The patient’s last bowel movement was 2 days ago. His temperature is 99.0°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 167/98 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 14/min, and oxygen saturation is 100% on room air. Physical exam is notable for suprapubic tenderness, and an ultrasound reveals 750 mL of fluid in the bladder. Which of the following is the most likely etiology of this patient’s symptoms? (D) Urinary tract infection (E) Worsening benign prostatic hypertrophy (C) Prostatic adenocarcinoma (B) Medication-induced symptoms (A) Constipation
Reason: The correct answer should actually be (E) Worsening benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) as the most likely etiology for this patient's urinary retention and symptoms. Given the patient's history of BPH, the sudden onset of difficulty initiating urination and feeling of incomplete voiding, coupled with the significant bladder distension and suprapubic tenderness, suggests an exacerbation of his underlying condition rather than an effect of his medications. While phenylephrine can contribute to urinary retention, the immediate context of his symptoms strongly points towards BPH worsening, especially given that he already has a history of this condition.

Question: A 27-year-old woman comes to her primary care physician complaining of palpitations. She reports that for the past 2 months she has felt anxious and states that her heart often feels like it’s “racing.” She also complains of sweating and unintentional weight loss. Physical examination reveals symmetrical, non-tender thyroid enlargement and exophthalmos. After additional testing, the patient is given an appropriate treatment for her condition. She returns 2 weeks later complaining of worsening of her previous ocular symptoms. Which of the following treatments did the patient most likely receive? (B) Propranolol (D) Radioactive iodine (A) Methimazole (C) Propylthiouracil (E) Thyroidectomy
Reason: The correct answer is (D) Radioactive iodine, as this treatment is commonly used for hyperthyroidism, particularly in cases of Graves' disease, which is suggested by the patient's symptoms of palpitations, anxiety, weight loss, and exophthalmos. The worsening of ocular symptoms (thyroid eye disease) after treatment with radioactive iodine can occur due to the inflammatory process being exacerbated by the treatment, leading to increased ocular symptoms following the dose.
Answer: (D) Radioactive iodine

Question: A 45-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes mellitus is brought to the physician because of a 3-week history of nausea, abdominal pain, and confusion. She has a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease treated with over-the-counter antacids. She does not smoke or drink alcohol. Her only medication is metformin. Her pulse is 86/min and blood pressure is 142/85 mm Hg. Examination shows a soft abdomen. Arterial blood gas analysis on room air shows:
pH 7.46
PCO2 44 mm Hg
PO2 94 mm Hg
HCO3- 30 mEq/L
An ECG shows a QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) of 0.36 seconds (N = 0.40–0.44). The serum concentration of which of the following substances is most likely to be increased in this patient?" (C) β-hydroxybutyrate (D) Phosphate (E) 24,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (A) Parathyroid hormone (B) Thyroid stimulating hormone
Reason: The correct answer is actually (C) β-hydroxybutyrate. This patient's presentation, including nausea, abdominal pain, confusion, and the metabolic state indicated by the arterial blood gas analysis (pH 7.46, indicating alkalosis with a slightly elevated HCO3-), suggests she is in a state of ketosis, likely due to inadequate glucose utilization related to her type 2 diabetes. In this condition, the body utilizes fatty acids for energy, producing ketone bodies such as β-hydroxybutyrate, which would consequently be elevated in her serum. The confusion might also suggest possible diabetic ketoacidosis, even with a normal pH, indicating a nuanced metabolic disturbance.
Answer: (E) 24,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol

Question: A 61-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his wife because of increasing confusion over the past 12 hours. His wife reports that he has a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus. His temperature is 38.8°C (101.8°F). He is confused and oriented only to person. Examination shows left periorbital swelling that is tender to palpation, mucopurulent rhinorrhea, and a black necrotic spot over the nose. There is discharge of the left eye with associated proptosis. A photomicrograph of a specimen obtained on biopsy of the left maxillary sinus is shown. Which of the following is the most likely causal organism? (D) Blastomyces dermatitidis (A) Pseudomonas aeruginosa (C) Aspergillus fumigatus (E) Pneumocystis jirovecii (B) Rhizopus microsporus
Reason: The correct answer is (B) Rhizopus microsporus. This patient displays classic signs of mucormycosis, a serious fungal infection often seen in individuals with compromised immune systems, such as those with type 1 diabetes. The combination of symptoms, including fever, confusion, periorbital swelling, black necrotic tissue, and proptosis, along with a history of diabetes, strongly suggests infection with a member of the Mucoraceae family, particularly Rhizopus species, which are frequently responsible for invasive mucormycosis and are known to cause such necrotic lesions.

Let's think step by step. 

The 21-month-old boy is presenting with deformities in both legs since he started walking, which raises concerns about potential developmental or structural issues. The examination findings, particularly the observation that the knees do not stay together when the feet and ankles are placed together, suggest a possible condition such as genu varum (bowlegs), which is common in toddlers as they begin to walk.

Given that he is otherwise healthy, has normal developmental milestones, and his growth parameters are within normal limits, the most appropriate next step in management would be to assess the underlying cause of the leg deformities. 

In this case, an X-ray of the lower extremities (Option C) would be the most appropriate next step. This imaging can help evaluate the alignment of the bones and rule out any underlying skeletal abnormalities or conditions such as rickets or Blount's disease.

Therefore, the answer is:
**(C) X-ray of the lower extremities.**

Question: A 31-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1, at 32 weeks' gestation comes to the emergency department for sudden leakage of clear vaginal fluid. Her pregnancy has been uncomplicated. Her first child was born at term by vaginal delivery. She has no history of serious illness. She does not drink alcohol or smoke cigarettes. Current medications include vitamin supplements. Her temperature is 37.2°C (98.9°F), pulse is 70/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 128/82 mm Hg. Speculum examination demonstrates clear fluid in the cervical canal. The fetal heart rate is reactive at 160/min with no decelerations. Tocometry shows uterine contractions. Nitrazine testing is positive. She is started on indomethacin. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? (D) Administer betamethasone and ampicillin (A) Administer betamethasone, ampicillin, and proceed with cesarean section (B) Administer ampicillin and perform amnioinfusion (C) Administer ampicillin and test amniotic fluid for fetal lung maturity (E) Administer betamethasone, ampicillin, and proceed with induction of labor
Reason: The most appropriate next step in the management of this patient is (D) Administer betamethasone and ampicillin. This is because the patient is 32 weeks pregnant with signs of preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) and is experiencing uterine contractions. Administering betamethasone is crucial for fetal lung maturity in a preterm infant, while ampicillin is given to reduce the risk of infection, particularly chorioamnionitis, which can occur after the membranes have ruptured. Neither immediate cesarean delivery, induction of labor, nor amnioinfusion is indicated at this point, as the focus should be on preparing for potential preterm delivery while ensuring maternal and fetal safety.

Question: A 36-year-old woman comes to the physician because of an 8-month history of occasional tremor. The tremor is accompanied by sudden restlessness and nausea, which disrupts her daily work as a professional violinist. The symptoms worsen shortly before upcoming concerts but also appear when she goes for a walk in the city. She is concerned that she might have a neurological illness and have to give up her career. The patient experiences difficulty falling asleep because she cannot stop worrying that a burglar might break into her house. Her appetite is good. She drinks one glass of wine before performances ""to calm her nerves"" and otherwise drinks 2–3 glasses of wine per week. The patient takes daily multivitamins as prescribed. She appears nervous. Her temperature is 36.8°C (98.2°F), pulse is 92/min, and blood pressure is 135/80 mm Hg. Mental status examination shows a full range of affect. On examination, a fine tremor on both hands is noted. She exhibits muscle tension. The remainder of the neurological exam shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this patient's symptoms?" (B) Essential tremor (D) Panic disorder (E) Atypical depressive disorder (C) Adjustment disorder (A) Generalized anxiety disorder
Reason: The most likely explanation for this patient's symptoms is (A) Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). The key indicators include her persistent worry about various aspects of her life, such as fear of a burglar breaking into her house, along with physical symptoms like tremors and muscle tension, which are common manifestations of anxiety. Moreover, her tremor worsens in situations that elicit stress, such as concerts, further supporting the diagnosis of GAD that often presents with both psychological and physiological symptoms.

Question: An investigator is studying gastric secretions in human volunteers. Measurements of gastric activity are recorded after electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve. Which of the following sets of changes is most likely to occur after vagus nerve stimulation?
 $$$ Somatostatin secretion %%% Gastrin secretion %%% Gastric pH $$$ (D) ↓ ↓ ↓ (C) ↑ ↑ ↑ (E) ↑ ↓ ↑ (A) ↑ ↑ ↓ (B) ↓ ↑ ↓
Reason: The most likely changes to occur after vagus nerve stimulation are (B) ↓ Somatostatin secretion, ↑ Gastrin secretion, and ↓ Gastric pH. Stimulation of the vagus nerve leads to increased gastric acid secretion due to heightened gastrin levels, while somatostatin, which inhibits gastrin secretion and gastric acid production, would decrease. This results in a lower gastric pH due to increased gastric acid output while the inhibition of somatostatin allows for more gastrin to be produced.

Question: An 11-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department because he was found to have severe abdominal pain and vomiting in school. On presentation, he is found to be lethargic and difficult to arouse. His parents noticed that he was eating and drinking more over the last month; however, they attributed the changes to entering a growth spurt. Physical exam reveals deep and rapid breathing as well as an fruity odor on his breath. Which of the following sets of labs would most likely be seen in this patient? (E) E (C) C (D) D (B) B (A) A
Reason: The most likely set of labs to be seen in this patient is (E) E, which would indicate metabolic acidosis, hyperglycemia, and ketonuria. The presentation of severe abdominal pain, vomiting, lethargy, deep rapid breathing (Kussmaul respirations), and a fruity odor on the breath strongly suggests diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), often seen in undiagnosed type 1 diabetes in children. In DKA, blood glucose levels rise, leading to hyperglycemia and subsequent ketone production, causing acidosis, which accounts for the clinical symptoms and the laboratory findings expected in this scenario.

Question: A 17-year-old boy presents to the emergency department of a hospital located in the town of Recuay (which is situated at 3,400 meters above mean sea level [MAMSL]) in the Ancash Region (Peru), 48 hours after returning from a 21-day stay in Lima (the capital city of Peru at 0 MAMSL). The patient has no previous medical history. His current complaints include cough, dyspnea at rest, hemoptysis, chest pain, and vomiting. His vital signs include: blood pressure 90/60 mm Hg; heart rate 149/min; respiratory rate 37/min; temperature 36.5°C (97.7°F); and O2 saturation 71%. Physical examination reveals polypnea, perioral cyanosis, intercostal retractions, and diffuse pulmonary crackles. His laboratory results are as follows:
Hemoglobin 19.2 g/dL
Hematocrit 60%
Leukocytes 13,000 (Bands: 12%, Seg: 78%, Eos: 0%, Bas: 0%, Mon: 6%)
Urea 25 mg/dL
Creatinine 0.96 mg/dL
A chest X-ray is shown. Which of the following statements is true and most likely regarding this patient’s condition?
  (D) The net change in response to hypoxia results in decreased cerebral blood flow (B) Hypoxic stimulation of the peripheral chemoreceptors results in increased minute ventilation (A) Following a rapid and sustained increase in altitude, decreased sympathetic activity transiently increases cardiac output, blood pressure, heart rate, and venous tone (E) The pulmonary vasculature relaxes in response to hypoxia (C) Marked increase in pressure gradient can lead to tissue hypoxia
Reason: The correct statement regarding this patient’s condition is (C) Marked increase in pressure gradient can lead to tissue hypoxia. This patient is likely experiencing high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) due to the rapid ascent to high altitude (3,400 meters) after being at sea level, which can cause increased pulmonary artery pressure. As pressures rise, fluid can leak into the alveoli, leading to decreased oxygen exchange and eventual tissue hypoxia, which explains both the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings of hypoxia and increased hematocrit due to a compensatory response to hypoxia.
Answer: (C) Marked increase in pressure gradient can lead to tissue hypoxia

Question: A 27-year-old woman with a history of a "heart murmur since childhood" presents following a series of syncopal episodes over the past several months. She also complains of worsening fatigue over this time period, and notes that her lips have begun to take on a bluish tinge, for which she has been using a brighter shade of lipstick. You do a careful examination, and detect a right ventricular heave, clubbing of the fingers, and 2+ pitting edema bilaterally to the shins. Despite your patient insisting that every doctor she has ever seen has commented on her murmur, you do not hear one. Transthoracic echocardiography would most likely detect which of the following? (D) Ventricular aneurysm (E) Dynamic left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (C) Positive bubble study (B) Mitral insufficiency (A) Aortic stenosis
Reason: The most likely finding on transthoracic echocardiography for this patient is (C) Positive bubble study. Given her history of syncope, worsening fatigue, cyanosis (bluish tinge to her lips), finger clubbing, and significant right ventricular heave, these symptoms indicate a possible right-to-left shunt or a congenital heart defect, such as a ventricular septal defect (VSD) with pulmonary hypertension. A positive bubble study would suggest the presence of such a shunt, allowing bubbles injected into the venous system to cross into the arterial system, indicating a right-to-left shunt and correlating with the patient's clinical presentation.

Question: A 22-year-old primigravid woman comes to the physician for her initial prenatal visit at 12 weeks' gestation. She has had generalized fatigue and shortness of breath over the past 2 months. She has also had a tingling sensation in her toes for the past month. Three years ago, she was treated for gonorrhea. She follows a strict vegan diet since the age of 13 years. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 111/min, and blood pressure is 122/80 mm Hg. Examination shows pale conjunctivae and a shiny tongue. Muscle tone and strength is normal. Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Sensation to vibration and position is decreased over the upper and lower extremities. When asked to stand, hold her arms in front of her, and close her eyes, she loses her balance and takes a step backward. Which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition? (B) Vitamin B12 supplementation (E) Iron supplementation (D) Penicillin G therapy (C) Thyroxine supplementation (A) Calcium supplementation
Reason: The most likely preventative measure for this patient’s condition is (B) Vitamin B12 supplementation. Given her strict vegan diet, she is at high risk for vitamin B12 deficiency, which can lead to anemia (evidenced by her pallor and fatigue) and neurological symptoms (such as the tingling sensation in her toes and balance issues related to loss of proprioception and vibration sense). These symptoms align with vitamin B12 deficiency, which can be corrected or prevented through appropriate supplementation.

Question: A 69-year-old woman is brought to her primary care physician by her son who is worried about her weight loss. The son reports that over the past 2 months she has lost at least 12 pounds. The patient denies any change in appetite but complains of diarrhea and abdominal discomfort. Additionally, she reports that her stools “smell awful,” which is embarrassing for her. Her son mentions that he feels she is becoming forgetful. She forgets phone conversations and often acts surprised when he visits, even though he always confirms his visits the night before. Her medical history includes arthritis, which she admits has been getting worse, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. She takes omeprazole. She is widowed and recently retired from being a national park ranger. The patient’s temperature is 100.3°F (37.9°C), blood pressure is 107/68 mmHg, and pulse is 88/min. On physical exam, she has a new systolic ejection murmur at the left upper sternal border. Labs show normocytic anemia. A transesophageal echocardiogram reveals a small mobile mass on the aortic valve with moderate aortic insufficiency. A colonoscopy is obtained with a small bowel biopsy. A periodic acid-Schiff stain is positive for foamy macrophages. Which of the following is the best next step in management? (A) Ceftriaxone and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (E) Prednisone then sulfasalazine (B) Dietary changes (D) Ibuprofen and hydroxychloroquine (C) Doxycycline
Reason: The best next step in management for this patient is (A) Ceftriaxone and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. The patient's presentation of weight loss, diarrhea, malabsorption indicated by the positive periodic acid-Schiff stain for foamy macrophages, and her history of aortic valve endocarditis (suggested by the mobile mass on the valve and the new murmur) suggest an underlying infection, likely due to an opportunistic pathogen like Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) related to her immunocompromised status. The use of ceftriaxone would cover for potential bacterial endocarditis, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is effective against Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia and toxoplasmosis, which are also common in immunocompromised patients. Thus, this combination addresses both her cardiac concerns and possible infections associated with her clinical findings.
Answer: (A) Ceftriaxone and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole

Let's think step by step. 

Niacin (vitamin B3) is known to cause flushing, which is a common side effect. This flushing is primarily due to the release of prostaglandins, which are mediators that cause vasodilation and increased blood flow to the skin, leading to the characteristic flushing sensation.

To mitigate this side effect, physicians often recommend taking aspirin before niacin, as aspirin can inhibit the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes that are responsible for the production of prostaglandins.

Given this information, the correct answer to the question regarding the mechanism of the side effect that the physician is trying to avoid is:

**(C) Release of prostaglandins.**

She has not taken any sedative medications. Her GCS is 6. She is connected to a mechanical ventilator. Her medical records show that she signed a living will 5 years ago, which indicates her refusal to receive any type of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, intubation, or maintenance of life support on mechanical ventilation. Her son, who has a durable power-of-attorney for her healthcare decisions, objects to the discontinuation of mechanical ventilation and wishes that his mother be kept alive without suffering in the chance that she might recover. Which of the following is the most appropriate response to her son regarding his wishes for his mother? (C) “She may be eligible for hospice care.” (D) “The opinion of her primary care physician must be obtained regarding further steps in management.” (A) “Based on her wishes, mechanical ventilation must be discontinued.” (E) “We will take every measure necessary to prolong her life.” (B) “Further management decisions will be referred to the hospital’s ethics committee.”
Reason: The most appropriate response to her son is (A) “Based on her wishes, mechanical ventilation must be discontinued.” This is because the patient has an advance directive that clearly states her refusal of life-sustaining treatments, including mechanical ventilation. In this case, her previously expressed wishes take precedence, even if the son wishes to override them.
Answer: (A) “Based on her wishes, mechanical ventilation must be discontinued.”

Question: A 32-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of sharp chest pain for 3 days. The pain is retrosternal, 8 out of 10 in intensity, increases with respiration, and decreases while sitting upright and leaning forward. He has nausea and myalgia. He has not had fever or a cough. He has asthma and was treated for bronchitis 6 months ago with azithromycin. His mother has hypertension. He uses an over-the-counter inhaler. His temperature is 37.3°C (99.1°F), pulse is 110/min, and blood pressure is 130/84 mm Hg. Breath sounds are normal. Cardiac examination shows a high-pitched grating sound between S1 and S2. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Serum studies show:
Urea nitrogen 16 mg/dl
Glucose 103 mg/dL
Creatinine 0.7 mg/dL
Troponin I 0.230 ng/mL (N < 0.1 ng/mL)
An ECG shows diffuse ST elevations in all leads. The patient is at increased risk for which of the following conditions?" (B) Pulmonary infarction (E) Ventricular aneurysm (C) Mediastinitis (A) Papillary muscle rupture (D) Cardiac tamponade
Reason: The correct answer is (D) Cardiac tamponade, as the patient's presentation suggests acute pericarditis, characterized by sharp chest pain that improves with leaning forward, as well as the presence of a pericardial friction rub noted on examination. Cardiac tamponade can occur as a complication of pericarditis, leading to impaired cardiac function due to the accumulation of fluid in the pericardial space.
Answer: (D) Cardiac tamponade

Question: In a lab experiment, a researcher treats early cells of the erythrocyte lineage with a novel compound called Pb82. Pb82 blocks the first step of heme synthesis. However, the experiment is controlled such that the cells otherwise continue to develop into erythrocytes. At the end of the experiment, the cells have developed into normal erythrocytes except that they are devoid of heme. A second compound, anti-Pb82 is administered which removes the effect of Pb82.

Which of the following is likely to be true of the mature red blood cells in this study? (B) The cells will not produce heme since they lack mitochondria (D) The cells will not produce heme because they lack nucleoli (E) The cells will not produce heme because they lack iron (A) The cells will now produce heme (C) The cells will not produce heme because they lack cytosol
Reason: The correct answer is (A) The cells will now produce heme. Although mature erythrocytes do lose their mitochondria during development, they can produce heme when the effects of the compound Pb82 are removed and the heme synthesis pathway is reestablished. Mature erythrocytes have the necessary components to produce heme once the initial blockade is lifted, as they are capable of utilizing the cellular machinery that remains from their earlier stages of development.
Answer: (B) The cells will not produce heme since they lack mitochondria

Question: A 65-year-old woman presents to her physician with chronic breathlessness. Her condition has been progressively worsening over the last 20 years despite treatment with inhaled salbutamol, inhaled corticosteroids, and multiple courses of antibiotics. She has a 30-pack-year smoking history but quit 20 years ago. Her pulse is 104/min and respirations are 28/min. Physical examination shows generalized wasting. Chest auscultation reveals expiratory wheezes bilaterally and distant heart sounds. Pulmonary function testing shows a non-reversible obstructive pattern. Her carbon monoxide diffusion capacity of the lungs (DLCO) is markedly reduced. Which of the following explains the underlying mechanism of her condition? (E) Inflammation of the pulmonary bronchi (A) Accumulation of fluid in the alveolar space (B) Contraction of pulmonary smooth muscles (D) Diminished surface area for gas exchange (C) Decreased partial pressure of alveolar oxygen
Reason: The correct answer is (D) Diminished surface area for gas exchange. The patient's presentation, which includes chronic breathlessness, a non-reversible obstructive pattern in pulmonary function tests, and a markedly reduced carbon monoxide diffusion capacity (DLCO), suggests that her underlying lung disease is likely due to emphysema, a condition characterized by the destruction of alveoli and loss of surface area available for gas exchange. This diminished surface area impairs the lungs' ability to transfer oxygen into the bloodstream effectively.
Answer: (D) Diminished surface area for gas exchange

Question: A 37-year-old G4P3 presents to her physician at 20 weeks gestation for routine prenatal care. Currently, she has no complaints; however, in the first trimester she was hospitalized due to acute pyelonephritis and was treated with cefuroxime. All her past pregnancies required  cesarean deliveries for medical indications. Her history is also significant for amenorrhea after weight loss at 19 years of age and a cervical polypectomy at 30 years of age. Today, her vital signs are within normal limits and a physical examination is unremarkable. A transabdominal ultrasound shows a normally developing male fetus without morphologic abnormalities, anterior placement of the placenta in the lower uterine segment, loss of the retroplacental hypoechoic zone, and visible lacunae within the myometrium. Which of the following factors present in this patient is a risk factor for the condition she has developed? (C) A history of amenorrhea (A) Genitourinary infections during pregnancy (E) Intake of antibiotics in the first trimester (B) Cervical surgery (D) Multiple cesarean deliveries
Reason: The correct answer is (D) Multiple cesarean deliveries. The presence of anteriorly implanted placenta in the lower uterine segment, along with the loss of the retroplacental hypoechoic zone and visible myometrial lacunae, suggests the likelihood of placenta accreta or similar placental implantation disorders, which are known to occur with increased risk in women who have had multiple cesarean deliveries. The previous surgeries can lead to scarring and changes in the uterine wall, which contribute to abnormal placentation in subsequent pregnancies.

Question: A 7-year-old boy is brought to the hospital for evaluation, he is accompanied by agents from child protective services after he was rescued from a home where he was being neglected. He was found locked in a closet and says that he was fed only once every 2 days for the past month. On presentation, he is found to be extremely emaciated with protruding ribs and prominent joints. He is provided with an appropriate rehydration and nourishment therapy. Despite his prolonged nutritional deprivation, the patient demonstrates appropriate cognitive function for his age. The transporter responsible for preventing cognitive decline in this malnourished patient has which of the following characteristics? (C) Responsive to insulin (E) Transports glucose against its concentration gradient (D) Has high affinity for fructose (A) Facilitates insulin release (B) Has high affinity for glucose
Reason: The correct answer is (B) Has high affinity for glucose. In the context of malnourishment and cognitive function, the brain relies heavily on glucose as its primary energy source. The transporter responsible for glucose uptake in the brain, specifically the glucose transporter type 1 (GLUT1), has a high affinity for glucose, allowing the brain to uptake adequate glucose even in states of limited availability, which is crucial for maintaining cognitive function in this malnourished patient.

[INFO] CoT response generated.
Let's analyze the question step by step.

The patient is experiencing a hypertensive emergency, characterized by severely elevated blood pressure (220/140 mmHg), headache, chest pain, vomiting, papilledema, and altered consciousness. The treatment involves an intravenous medication that releases nitric oxide, which activates guanylate cyclase and increases cGMP in vascular smooth muscle, leading to vasodilation.

The key effects of this medication would include:

1. **Vasodilation**: The release of nitric oxide leads to relaxation of vascular smooth muscle, which decreases systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and lowers blood pressure.

2. **Decreased Preload**: As systemic vascular resistance decreases, there is a reduction in the return of blood to the heart (preload), which can lead to a decrease in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP).

3. **Decreased Pulmonary Capillary Wedge Pressure (PCWP)**: This is a reflection of left atrial pressure and is often used as an estimate of left ventricular filling pressure. With decreased preload and systemic vascular resistance, PCWP would also decrease.

Given these effects, the most appropriate answer from the options provided is:

**(D) Decreased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure.**

This is because the medication's vasodilatory effects would lead to a reduction in pressures associated with the heart's filling, including the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure.

Question: A 48-year-old female with a history of hypertension, type II diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, and asthma undergoes a scheduled total abdominal hysterectomy for symptomatic fibroids. She is given a dose of preoperative prophylactic antibiotics. Her urinary catheter is removed on post-operative day one. She is on low-molecular-weight heparin for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis. On post-operative day four, the patient complains of abdominal pain. She denies cough, nausea, vomiting, or dysuria, but has had 3-4 loose stools over her hospitalization. Her temperature is 101.0°F (38.3°C), blood pressure is 97/59 mmHg, pulse is 106/min, and respirations are 16/min. The surgical wound has new erythema with dusky patches and abundant cloudy discharge. The patient reports new decreased sensation around her wound site. Her lungs are clear to auscultation and abdomen is soft with hypoactive bowel sounds. She has no costovertebral angle tenderness. Urinalysis is within normal limits and urine culture grows >100,000 CFU/mL of Escherichia coli.

Which of the following is the best next step in management? (B) Oral levofloxacin for 3 days (E) Vancomycin/piperacillin-tazobactam/clindamycin and debridement of the surgical wound (D) Vancomycin/piperacillin-tazobactam/clindamycin and observation (C) Oral vancomycin for 10-14 days (A) Discontinue low-molecular-weight heparin
Reason: The patient's presentation, which includes fever, abdominal pain, new erythema around the surgical site with dusky patches, and abundant cloudy discharge, raises concern for a serious surgical site infection, possibly involving necrotizing fasciitis or an abscess. The presence of Escherichia coli in urine culture suggests a urinary tract infection, but the systemic signs and those at the wound site necessitate a broader and aggressive approach, including broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics (vancomycin/piperacillin-tazobactam/clindamycin) and surgical intervention for debridement to manage the infection effectively.
Answer: (E) Vancomycin/piperacillin-tazobactam/clindamycin and debridement of the surgical wound

Question: A 19-year-old college student presents to student health with 1 day of fever and chills. He says that he has also been coughing for 2 days. His roommate was sick 3 days ago with similar symptoms and was diagnosed with Mycoplasma infection. He has otherwise been healthy and has had all the required vaccines as scheduled. He is currently taking introductory biology as part of his premedical studies and recently learned about antibodies. He therefore asks his physician about what his body is doing to fight off the infection. At this stage of his infection, which of the following forms are the antibodies circulating in his serum? (E) Trimers (B) Monomers (A) Dimers (D) Tetramers (C) Pentamers
Reason: In the early stages of an infection, particularly one caused by organisms like Mycoplasma, the primary antibody produced is Immunoglobulin M (IgM), which is known to form pentameric structures. This pentameric form allows IgM to effectively bind to pathogens and agglutinate them, providing an early defense mechanism against the infection while the body starts to generate other types of antibodies.

Question: You are a resident in the surgical ICU. One of the patients you are covering is a 35-year-old pregnant G1P0 in her first trimester admitted for complicated appendicitis and awaiting appendectomy. Your attending surgeon would like you to start the patient on moxifloxacin IV preoperatively. You remember from your obstetrics clerkship, however, that moxifloxacin is Pregnancy Category C, and animal studies have shown that immature animals exposed to flouroquinolones like moxifloxicin may experience cartilage damage. You know that there are potentially safer antibiotics, such as piperacillin/tazobactam, which is in Pregnancy Category B. What should you do? (A) Administer piperacillin/tazobactam instead of moxifloxacin without discussing with the attending since your obligation is to "first, do no harm" and both are acceptable antibiotics for complicated appendicitis. (E) Wait to administer any antibiotics until you discuss your safety concerns with your attending. (B) Administer moxifloxacin since it is only Pregnancy Category C and, although studies may have revealed adverse effects in animals, there is no definite evidence that it causes risk in humans. (D) Discuss the adverse effects of each antibiotic with the patient, and then let the patient decide which antibiotic she would prefer. (C) Administer moxifloxacin since the attending is the executive decision maker and had to know the patient was pregnant when deciding on an antibiotic.
Reason: The best answer is (E) because it is crucial to ensure patient safety and to involve the attending surgeon in the decision-making process regarding antibiotic administration, especially in a pregnant patient. Discussing concerns about the potential risks of moxifloxacin in pregnancy allows for a collaborative decision that considers the clinical status of the patient and the safest treatment options available.

Current medications include metoprolol, lisinopril, spironolactone, metformin, and simvastatin. He has smoked half a pack of cigarettes daily for the past 25 years. His temperature is 38.5°C (101.3°F), pulse is 95/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 120/84 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 93%. Examination shows dullness to percussion and an increased tactile fremitus in the right lower lung field. Auscultation over this area shows bronchial breath sounds and whispered pectoriloquy. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of these findings? (A) Parenchymal consolidation (C) Alveolar transudate (E) Pulmonary infarction (D) Ruptured pulmonary blebs (B) Pleural fluid accumulation
Reason: The answer is (A) Parenchymal consolidation because the findings of dullness to percussion, increased tactile fremitus, bronchial breath sounds, and whispered pectoriloquy indicate that there is a solidification of lung tissue, typically caused by pneumonia or other forms of consolidation. This pattern is consistent with an area of lung that is filled with fluid or solid material rather than air, which explains the patient's shortness of breath, cough, and chest pain exacerbated by deep inspiration.

Reason: The answer is (B) ↑ reticulocyte count because reticulocytes are immature red blood cells that are released from the bone marrow in response to anemia and are typically the first indicator of the bone marrow's response to increased erythropoietin levels following treatment for iron deficiency anemia. When iron therapy is initiated, the body quickly mobilizes reticulocytes to compensate for the low hemoglobin levels, which results in an increased reticulocyte count within a few days, before hemoglobin levels show improvement.
Answer: (B) ↑ reticulocyte count

Question: A 42-year-old woman comes to the physician because of stiffness and pain in multiple joints. She says that the fingers on both of her hands have become increasingly stiff and difficult to move over the past 8 months. She also complains of nails that break easily and look spotty as well as chronic back pain. She had a urinary tract infection a year ago that was treated with antibiotics. She is sexually active with 2 male partners and uses condoms inconsistently. Her vitals are within normal limits. A photograph of her right hand is shown. There are multiple, well-demarcated red plaques with silvery-white scales over the shins and back. Serum studies show a negative rheumatoid factor and ANA. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? (B) Ankylosing spondylitis (C) Rheumatoid arthritis (D) Systemic lupus erythematosus (A) Secondary syphilis (E) Psoriatic arthritis
"
Reason: The answer is (E) Psoriatic arthritis because the patient's presentation of joint stiffness and pain, particularly in the hands, along with the presence of well-demarcated red plaques with silvery-white scales on the skin, is characteristic of psoriasis and its associated arthritis. Additionally, the negative rheumatoid factor and ANA further support a diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis rather than rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus, making it the most likely diagnosis given the clues provided.
Answer: (E) Psoriatic arthritis

Let's think step by step. The patient's symptoms of hip and back pain, particularly the description of pain that travels down his leg and feels "electrical," suggest a possible radiculopathy, which is often associated with nerve root compression, commonly seen in conditions like herniated discs or spinal stenosis.

To confirm the diagnosis of radiculopathy, the **straight leg raise test (C)** is a common and effective physical examination maneuver. This test helps to assess for nerve root irritation or compression, particularly of the L4-S1 nerve roots, which can cause pain that radiates down the leg.

Therefore, the most likely option to help confirm the diagnosis is:

**Answer: (C) Straight leg raise**

Question: A 65-year-old man is brought to his primary care provider by his concerned wife. She reports he has had this "thing" on his eye for years and refuses to seek care. He denies any pain or discharge from the affected eye. A picture of his eye is shown below. Given the diagnosis, what are you most likely to discover when taking this patient's history? (E) He suffered a burn to his eye while cleaning his bathroom with bleach 5 years earlier (B) He suffered from recurrent conjunctivitis in his youth (C) He grew up in Ecuador, where he worked outdoors as a farmer for 30 years (A) He experienced shingles three years ago, with a positive Hutchinson's sign (D) He was involved in a bar fight and experienced a ruptured globe 10 years ago
Reason: The most likely answer is (C) because the patient’s condition is possibly related to exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light, which can lead to a pterygium or pinguecula—a growth on the eye. Growing up in a sunny climate while working outdoors increases the likelihood of UV exposure, which is a well-known risk factor for these types of eye lesions.
Answer: (C) He grew up in Ecuador, where he worked outdoors as a farmer for 30 years

Question: A 50-year-old woman, gravida 5, para 5, comes to the physician for the evaluation of decreased sexual desire for approximately 6 months. She has been sexually active with her husband but reports that she has no desire in having sexual intercourse anymore. She states that she feels guilty and is worried about losing her husband if this problem goes on for a longer period of time. She also reports that they have had several fights recently due to financial problems. She has problems going to sleep and wakes up often, and is tired throughout the day. One year ago, the patient underwent hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy due to uterine prolapse. Her last menstrual period was 2 years ago. She does not smoke. She drinks 3–4 glasses of wine daily. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows no abnormalities except for an enlarged liver. Which of the following most likely explains this patient's loss of libido? (C) Decreased testosterone (D) Elevated prolactin (A) Chronic alcohol intake (B) Major depressive disorder (E) Stress
Reason: The most likely answer is (C) Decreased testosterone because hormonal changes, especially related to the removal of the ovaries during her surgery, can lead to decreased levels of testosterone, which is linked to a reduction in sexual desire. Additionally, other factors such as her age and possible hormonal imbalance following a hysterectomy could further compound her decreased libido.
Answer: (C) Decreased testosterone

Question: A 20-year-old man presents with a painless neck mass that has gradually increased in size. The mass is anteromedial to the right sternocleidomastoid muscle and has been present for 3 years. The mass increased in size and became more tender following an upper respiratory infection. An ultrasound of the neck identifies a single, round cystic mass with uniform, low echogenicity, and no internal septations. A contrast-enhanced CT scan of the neck shows a homogeneous mass with low attenuation centrally and with smooth rim enhancement. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? (E) Cervical lymphadenopathy (B) Ectopic thyroid tissue (D) Sternomastoid tumor (C) Second branchial cleft cyst (A) First branchial cleft cyst
Reason: The most likely diagnosis is (C) Second branchial cleft cyst because the presentation of a painless, gradually enlarging neck mass that became tender following an upper respiratory infection aligns with the typical characteristics of a branchial cleft cyst. Additionally, the ultrasound and CT findings of a cystic mass with low echogenicity, smooth margins, and lack of internal structures point towards a branchial cleft cyst rather than other potential diagnoses.

Question: A 31-year-old man presents with jaundice, scleral icterus, dark urine, and pruritus. He also says that he has been experiencing abdominal pain shortly after eating. He says that symptoms started a week ago and have not improved. The patient denies any associated fever or recent weight-loss. He is afebrile and vital signs are within normal limits. On physical examination, the patient’s skin appears yellowish. Scleral icterus is present. Remainder of physical examination is unremarkable. Laboratory findings are significant for:
Conjugated bilirubin 5.1 mg/dL
Total bilirubin 6.0 mg/dL
AST 24 U/L
ALT 22 U/L
Alkaline phosphatase 662 U/L
A contrast CT of the abdomen is unremarkable. An ultrasound of the right upper quadrant reveals a normal gallbladder, but the common bile duct is not visible. Which of the following is the next best step in the management of this patient? (D) Serologies for antimitochondrial antibodies (B) HIDA scan (C) Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) (E) Hepatitis serologies (A) Antibiotics and admit to observation
Reason: The next best step in the management of this patient is (C) Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) because the clinical presentation of jaundice, dark urine, and pruritus, along with the laboratory findings indicating elevated conjugated bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase, suggest a possible obstruction of the biliary tree. The unremarkable CT scan and the inability to visualize the common bile duct on ultrasound further indicate the need for ERCP to diagnose and potentially relieve any obstruction.

Question: A previously healthy 13-year-old girl is brought to the physician for evaluation of a 2-month history of fatigue. She reports recurrent episodes of pain in her right wrist and left knee. During this period, she has had a 4-kg (8.8-lb) weight loss. Her mother has rheumatoid arthritis. Her temperature is 38°C (100.4°F). Examination shows diffuse lymphadenopathy. Oral examination shows several painless oral ulcers. The right wrist and the left knee are swollen and tender. Laboratory studies show a hemoglobin concentration of 9.8 g/dL, a leukocyte count of 2,000/mm3, and a platelet count of 75,000/mm3. Urinalysis shows excessive protein. This patient's condition is associated with which of the following laboratory findings? (B) Anti-dsDNA antibodies (C) Anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies (D) Excessive lymphoblasts (E) Positive HLA-B27 test (A) Leukocytoclastic vasculitis with IgA and C3 immune complex deposition
Reason: The correct answer is (B) Anti-dsDNA antibodies because the clinical presentation of this 13-year-old girl, including fatigue, arthritis, lymphadenopathy, oral ulcers, and laboratory findings such as anemia and leukopenia, suggests a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Anti-dsDNA antibodies are characteristic markers associated with SLE and are often indicative of disease activity, which aligns with her symptoms and findings.

Question: A 60-year-old woman presents for an evaluation for snoring. According to her husband, her snoring has increased over the last year, and he can’t tolerate it anymore. He has also noticed that she wakes up at night regularly for a few seconds but then falls back asleep. During the day, the patient says she is sleepy most of the time and complains of headaches and poor concentration. Past medical history is significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Her temperature is 36.6°C (97.9°F), blood pressure is 156/98 mm Hg, pulse is 90/min and respirations are 20/min. Her body mass index (BMI) is 38 kg/m2. A polysomnographic study is ordered, and the result is shown below. While counseling the patient about her condition and available treatment options, she is asked if she wants to try a new therapy in which a device stimulates one of her cranial nerves. Which of the following muscles would most likely be stimulated by this method? (D) Palatoglossus muscle (B) Digastric muscle (E) Intercostal muscles (C) Hyoglossus muscle (A) Genioglossus muscle
Reason: The most likely answer is (A) Genioglossus muscle because this muscle plays a crucial role in maintaining airway patency by protruding the tongue and preventing airway obstruction during sleep. In the context of treating obstructive sleep apnea, a device that stimulates the hypoglossal nerve (which innervates the genioglossus muscle) can help reduce snoring and improve sleep apnea symptoms by promoting tongue movement away from the airway.

Question: A 70-year-old man is brought to the emergency room with complaints of severe substernal chest pain for the last hour. The pain started suddenly, and the patient describes the pain as “going into the shoulder”. The patient took aspirin at home and has been given multiple doses of sublingual nitroglycerin, but the pain has not subsided. He has a blood pressure of 112/84 mm Hg, the pulse is 63/min, the respiratory rate is 18/min, and the temperature is 36.9°C (98.0°F). Cardiac auscultation reveals normal S1 and S2 sounds, however, an additional S4 sound is heard. The patient is sweating profusely, and the lungs are clear to auscultation. No jugular venous distension or pedal edema is observed. His initial ECG shows ST elevation in leads II, III, and aVF. Which of the following will likely have the most benefit in this patient? (E) Percutaneous coronary intervention (B) Beta blockers (A) Antiarrhythmics (D) Thrombolytics (C) Clopidogrel
Reason: The most likely answer is (E) Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) because the patient is presenting with ST elevation in leads II, III, and aVF, indicative of an inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). In cases of STEMI, PCI is the preferred treatment to restore blood flow to the occluded coronary artery and reduce myocardial damage, particularly when the patient has persistent chest pain despite initial medical therapy.

To determine the most appropriate assessment of the woman's carrier status for the disease affecting her brother, we need to consider the inheritance pattern of the condition described. The symptoms of mild developmental delay and the need to limit dietary intake of phenylalanine suggest that her brother may have phenylketonuria (PKU), which is an autosomal recessive disorder.

In autosomal recessive inheritance:
- Both parents must be carriers (heterozygous) for their child to be affected.
- If the brother is affected, both parents must be carriers of the gene mutation.

Since the woman is healthy and has no symptoms, we need to assess her carrier status. The probability that she is a carrier depends on the carrier status of her parents. If both parents are carriers, the probability that she is a carrier is 2/3 (since she cannot be affected and has a 1/4 chance of being affected if both parents are carriers).

Thus, the most appropriate assessment of her carrier status is:

Question: A 39-year-old man presents to a primary care clinic for a routine physical exam. He denies any complaints. He has a long beard and hair, wears several copper bracelets, and a crystal amulet. When asked about his diet, he discloses eating mostly canned foods, which he has stockpiled in his cabin in case there is a natural disaster or "apocalypse" (though he admits that this is highly unlikely). He has a few close friends, but feels awkward when meeting new people. He seems happy overall and has many long-standing interests, including hiking and astrology. He has been steadily employed as a data scientist and a paranormal investigator. He has never been diagnosed with a mental illness, though he has a family history of schizophrenia. Review of systems is negative for depressed mood, anxiety, or hallucinations. Thought process is linear and reality testing is intact. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis for this patient? (E) Schizotypal personality disorder (D) Schizophreniform disorder (C) Schizophrenia (A) Brief psychotic disorder (B) Schizoid personality disorder
Reason: The patient's peculiar behaviors, such as his strong beliefs in astrology and stockpiling food for an unlikely apocalypse, alongside his eccentric appearance, suggest a diagnosis of schizotypal personality disorder. This condition is characterized by social anxiety, unusual beliefs or magical thinking, and eccentric behavior without the presence of full-blown psychosis, which aligns with the patient's well-functioning lifestyle and intact reality testing indicated in the vignette.

Question: A man is brought into the emergency department by police. The patient was found somnolent in the park and did not respond to questioning. The patient's past medical history is unknown, and he is poorly kempt. The patient's personal belongings include prescription medications and illicit substances such as alprazolam, diazepam, marijuana, cocaine, alcohol, acetaminophen, and a baggie containing an unknown powder. His temperature is 97.0°F (36.1°C), blood pressure is 117/58 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, respirations are 9/min, and oxygen saturation is 91% on room air. Physical exam reveals pupils that do not respond to light bilaterally, and a somnolent patient who only withdraws his limbs to pain. Which of the following is the best next step in management? (C) N-acetylcysteine (D) Naloxone (E) Supportive therapy, thiamine, and dextrose (A) Flumazenil (B) Intubation
Reason: The patient's respiratory depression, decreased level of consciousness, and the presence of multiple substances suggest potential opioid involvement, given the noted somnolence and low respiratory rate. Naloxone is the best next step in management to rapidly reverse opioid toxicity, which could restore adequate respiratory function and consciousness in this potentially life-threatening situation.

Question: A 56-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with an episode of nausea and severe unrelenting right upper abdominal pain. She had a cholecystectomy for gallstones a year earlier and has since experienced frequent recurrences of abdominal pain, most often after a meal. Her past medical history is otherwise unremarkable and she only takes medications for her pain when it becomes intolerable. Her physical exam is normal except for an intense abdominal pain upon deep palpation of her right upper quadrant. Her laboratory values are unremarkable with the exception of a mildly elevated alkaline phosphatase, amylase, and lipase. Her abdominal ultrasound shows a slightly enlarged common bile duct at 8 mm in diameter (N = up to 6 mm) and a normal pancreatic duct. The patient is referred to a gastroenterology service for an ERCP (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography) to stent her common bile duct. During the procedure the sphincter at the entrance to the duct is constricted. Which statement best describes the regulation of the function of the sphincter which is hampering the cannulation of the pancreatic duct in this patient? (D) A hormone released by the M cells of the duodenum is the most effective cause of relaxation. (A) A hormone released by the I cells of the duodenum in the presence of fatty acids is the most effective cause of relaxation. (B) The sphincter is contracted between meals. (C) Sphincter relaxation is enhanced via stimulation of opioid receptors. (E) Regulation of function of the sphincter of Oddi does not involve neural inputs.
Reason: The sphincter of Oddi controls the flow of bile and pancreatic juice into the duodenum and is primarily regulated by the hormone cholecystokinin (CCK), which is released by I cells in the duodenum in response to the presence of fatty acids. This hormone promotes relaxation of the sphincter, facilitating the passage of bile and pancreatic secretions; thus, its release is critical for proper digestive function, and understanding this regulation helps to elucidate why the sphincter might be constricted during endoscopic procedures, complicating access to the pancreatic duct.
Answer: (A) A hormone released by the I cells of the duodenum in the presence of fatty acids is the most effective cause of relaxation.

Question: A 37-year-old G1P000 presents to her obstetrician for her first prenatal visit. She states that her last menstrual period (LMP) was 11 weeks ago, though she is unsure of the exact date as her periods are sometimes irregular. She and her husband had 5 months of timed, unprotected intercourse before she had a positive home pregnancy test 2 weeks ago. She has been feeling generally well but notes some morning nausea and vomiting. She also mentions that for the last 6 months or so, she has felt increasing pelvic pressure and worsening urinary frequency but has not sought medical care for these symptoms. The patient has a history of obesity and hypertension but is not on any medications. Her mother had a hysterectomy at age 64 for fibroids, and her sister had a twin pregnancy after assisted reproduction. At this visit, the patient’s temperature is 98.3° F (36.8° C), blood pressure is 142/85 mmHg, pulse is 82/min, and respirations are 14/min. She has gained 4 pounds since the last time she weighed herself 4 months ago. On exam, the patient’s fundus is palpated at the umbilicus, her cervix is closed and firm, and there are no adnexal masses. Her lab results are shown below:

ß-hCG: 81,324 mIU/mL
Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH): 1.2 µIU/L

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? (A) Molar pregnancy (C) Leiomyomata (E) Anteverted uterus (D) Multiple gestation pregnancy (B) Dating error due to unreliable LMP
Reason: The patient's increasing pelvic pressure and worsening urinary frequency, along with the significant elevation of ß-hCG, suggest the presence of leiomyomata (uterine fibroids) rather than a molar pregnancy or multiple gestation, especially given the absence of atypical symptoms associated with those conditions. The elevated hormone levels could be attributed to the fibroids if they are large enough to affect the overall hormonal milieu, and her symptoms align with common presentations of fibroids, particularly in the context of her history and clinical findings.

Question: A 17-year-old girl comes to the physician because of a sore throat, fevers, and fatigue for the past 3 weeks. Her temperature is 37.8°C (100°F), pulse is 97/min, and blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg. Examination of the head and neck shows cervical lymphadenopathy, pharyngeal erythema, enlarged tonsils with exudates, and palatal petechiae. The spleen is palpated 2 cm below the left costal margin. Her leukocyte count is 14,100/mm3 with 54% lymphocytes (12% atypical lymphocytes). Results of a heterophile agglutination test are positive. This patient is at increased risk for which of the following conditions? (D) Hodgkin lymphoma (A) Rheumatic fever (C) Hepatocellular carcinoma (B) Kaposi sarcoma (E) Mycotic aneurysm
Reason: The patient's symptoms and positive heterophile agglutination test indicate infectious mononucleosis, which is typically caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Following an EBV infection, there is an established association with an increased risk for developing Hodgkin lymphoma later in life, particularly in adolescents and young adults, making this the most relevant condition linked to her current presentation.

Question: A 65-year-old male prisoner goes on a hunger strike to protest the conditions of his detainment. After 5 days without food, he suffers a seizure for which he is taken into a medical facility. On physical examination, he looks pale and diaphoretic. His blood glucose level is 50 mg/dL. In order to keep a constant supply of energy to his brain, which of the following molecules is his liver releasing into the bloodstream? (A) ß-hydroxybutyric acid (D) Glucose-6-phosphate (E) Glycogen (B) Fatty acids (C) Glucose-1-phosphate
Reason: During prolonged fasting or starvation, such as in this patient's case after 5 days without food, the liver shifts its metabolic processes. In this state, ketogenesis is stimulated, resulting in the production of ketone bodies, including ß-hydroxybutyric acid, which provides a crucial alternative energy source for the brain when glucose levels are low. Thus, the liver releases ß-hydroxybutyric acid into the bloodstream to help sustain energy levels in the brain during periods of inadequate glucose availability.
Answer: (A) ß-hydroxybutyric acid

Let's think step by step. 

The patient presents with signs of altered mental status, muscle rigidity, hyperthermia, and autonomic instability (elevated heart rate and blood pressure). These symptoms are suggestive of a serious condition known as neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) or possibly serotonin syndrome, especially given the context of his behavior at a party, which may indicate substance use.

In cases of NMS, the best next step in management after supportive care is to administer dantrolene, which is a muscle relaxant that can help reduce muscle rigidity and hyperthermia associated with this condition. 

Given that the patient's symptoms are persistent despite initial supportive measures, the best next step in management is:

He now wakes up 3–5 times every night to urinate. He has hypertension treated with hydrochlorothiazide and lisinopril. The patient has smoked a half-pack of cigarettes daily for the past 30 years. He appears well. His temperature is 37.3°C (99.1°F), pulse is 77/min, and blood pressure is 128/77 mm Hg. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. His abdomen is soft and nontender. Digital rectal examination shows a diffusely enlarged prostate with a firm nodule in the right posterior lobe. Urinalysis is within normal limits. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level is 6.5 ng/mL (N = 0–4). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? (C) Transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy (B) Repeat PSA level in one year (D) CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis (A) Cystoscopy (E) Simple prostatectomy
Reason: The most appropriate next step in management in this scenario is (C) Transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy. This patient has symptoms suggestive of prostate enlargement, along with a notable PSA elevation and a firm nodule on the prostate, which raises suspicion for prostate cancer. A biopsy is required to confirm or rule out the diagnosis of malignancy based on these concerning findings.

Question: An investigator is studying cardiomyocytes in both normal and genetically modified mice. Both the normal and genetically modified mice are observed after aerobic exercise and their heart rates are recorded and compared. After a 10-minute session on a treadmill, the average pulse measured in the normal mice is 680/min, whereas in the genetically modified mice it is only 160/min. Which of the following is most likely to account for the increased heart rate seen in the normal mice? (A) Greater cardiomyocyte size (D) Lower number of gap junctions (E) Greater T-tubule density (B) Lower threshold potential for Ca2+ channel opening (C) Greater ratio of heart to body weight
Reason: The most likely explanation for the increased heart rate observed in the normal mice is (E) Greater T-tubule density. Greater T-tubule density enhances the ability of cardiomyocytes to rapidly transmit action potentials and facilitate calcium entry during depolarization, which supports more effective and efficient heart contractions, resulting in a higher heart rate during exercise.
Answer: (E) Greater T-tubule density

The boy was born at 39 weeks gestation via spontaneous vaginal delivery. He is up to date on all vaccines and is meeting all developmental milestones. The past medical history is noncontributory. The boy takes a multivitamin every day. The mother reports that he does well in school and is helpful around the house. The boy’s vital signs include blood pressure 110/65 mm Hg, heart rate 110/min, respiratory rate 32/min, and temperature 38.3°C (101.0°F). On physical examination, the boy appears uncomfortable and has difficulty breathing. His heart is mildly tachycardic with a regular rhythm and his lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Oropharyngeal examination shows that his palatine tonsils are covered with pus and that there is erythema of the surrounding mucosa. Which of the following mediators is responsible for this patient’s elevated temperature? (B) Thromboxane A2 (D) Prostaglandin I2 (A) Leukotriene D4 (E) Prostaglandin F2 (C) Prostaglandin E2
Reason: The mediator responsible for the patient's elevated temperature is (C) Prostaglandin E2. Prostaglandin E2 is known to play a crucial role in the fever response by acting on the hypothalamus to increase body temperature, particularly during infections like the one suggested by this child's symptoms of fever, sore throat, and pus-covered tonsils.

Question: A 3-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department for nausea and vomiting for 1 day. His maternal uncle had a seizure disorder and died in childhood. He appears fatigued. Respirations are 32/min. Examination shows diffuse weakness in the extremities. Serum studies show a low pH, elevated lactate concentration, and normal blood glucose. A metabolic condition characterized by a defect in oxidative phosphorylation is suspected. Microscopic examination of a muscle biopsy specimen of this patient is most likely to show which of the following findings? (B) Muscle atrophy with perimysial inflammation (E) Subsarcolemmal accumulation of mitochondria (A) Fibrofatty replacement of normal muscle fibers (D) Endomysial inflammation with T cell infiltration (C) Intermyofibrillar accumulation of glycogen
Reason: The most likely finding in a muscle biopsy for this patient is (E) Subsarcolemmal accumulation of mitochondria. In conditions characterized by defects in oxidative phosphorylation, there is often an adaptive response seen in the muscle, which includes the accumulation of mitochondria near the muscle cell membrane (subsarcollemmal location) as the cells attempt to compensate for impaired energy production. This aligns with the symptoms and metabolic derangements observed in the patient.

The temperature is 38.8°C (101.8°F), the blood pressure is 110/65 mm Hg, the pulse is 82/min, and the respirations are 14/min. Examination of the catheter site, skin, head and neck, heart, lungs, abdomen, and perirectal area shows no abnormalities. The results of the laboratory studies show:
Hemoglobin 9 g/dL
Leukocyte count 800/mm3
Percent segmented neutrophils 40%
Platelet count 85,000/mm3
Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy at this time? (A) Caspofungin (B) Ciprofloxacin (C) Imipenem (D) Valacyclovir (E) Vancomycin
Reason: The most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient is (C) Imipenem. Given that she has acute myeloid leukemia and is demonstrating neutropenic fever (with a leukocyte count of 800/mm³ and relatively low neutrophils), she is at high risk for severe bacterial infections. Imipenem, a broad-spectrum carbapenem antibiotic, covers a wide range of potential pathogens and is commonly used for empirical treatment in febrile neutropenic patients until a specific source of infection is identified.
Answer: (C) Imipenem

Question: An investigator studying the immunologic profile of various cells notices that the blood of a test subject agglutinates upon addition of a serum containing antibodies against P blood group antigens. Infection with which of the following pathogens would most likely be prevented by these antibodies? (D) Epstein Barr virus (C) Plasmodium vivax (B) Babesia microti (A) Parvovirus B19 (E) Influenza virus
Reason: The antibodies against P blood group antigens are most likely to prevent infection with (A) Parvovirus B19. This is because Parvovirus B19 specifically utilizes the P antigen as a receptor for cellular entry. Consequently, the presence of antibodies against these antigens would inhibit the virus's ability to attach and infect target cells, thereby preventing the infection.
Answer: (A) Parvovirus B19

Question: A 51-year-old woman comes to the physician because of progressively worsening lower back pain. The pain radiates down the right leg to the lateral side of the foot. She has had no trauma, urinary incontinence, or fever. An MRI of the lumbar spine shows disc degeneration and herniation at the level of L5–S1. Which of the following is the most likely finding on physical examination? (D) Weak achilles tendon reflex (B) Exaggerated patellar tendon reflex (E) Diminished sensation of the anterior lateral thigh
" (C) Diminished sensation of the anus and genitalia (A) Difficulty walking on heels
Reason: The most likely finding on physical examination for this patient is (D) Weak achilles tendon reflex. The patient's symptoms, including lower back pain radiating down the right leg and the MRI findings of disc herniation at the L5-S1 level, suggest possible involvement of the S1 nerve root, which is responsible for the achilles tendon reflex. A herniated disc can compress this nerve root, leading to a diminished reflex response.
Answer: (D) Weak achilles tendon reflex

Question: A 56-year-old woman visits her family physician accompanied by her son. She has recently immigrated to Canada and does not speak English. Her son tells the physician that he is worried that his mother gets a lot of sugar in her diet and does not often monitor her glucose levels. Her previous lab work shows a HbA1c value of 8.7%. On examination, her blood pressure is 130/87 mm Hg and weight is 102 kg (224.9 lb). Which of the following is the correct location of where the glucose transport is most likely affected in this patient? (B) Liver (E) Red blood cells (A) Pancreas (C) Brain (D) Skeletal muscle
Reason: The correct location where glucose transport is most likely affected in this patient is (D) Skeletal muscle. In patients with diabetes, such as this woman with an HbA1c of 8.7%, insulin resistance commonly occurs, particularly in skeletal muscle, which impairs the ability of glucose to enter the cells. Since skeletal muscle is a major site for glucose uptake in response to insulin, its dysfunction in this case contributes to elevated blood glucose levels.
Answer: (D) Skeletal muscle

Let's analyze the situation step by step.

The patient has a mid-systolic murmur that radiates to the carotids, which is suggestive of aortic stenosis. When the physician instructs the patient to stand from a supine position, several hemodynamic changes occur due to the effects of gravity and the shift in blood volume.

1. **Standing from Supine Position**: When a person stands up, there is a transient decrease in venous return to the heart due to blood pooling in the lower extremities. This leads to a decrease in preload (the volume of blood in the ventricles at the end of diastole).

2. **Effects on Cardiac Function**: The decrease in preload results in a reduction in stroke volume and cardiac output initially. The body compensates for this by increasing heart rate and systemic vascular resistance.

3. **Changes in Pressures**:
   - **Left Ventricular End-Diastolic Pressure (LVEDP)**: This would decrease due to reduced preload.
   - **Right Atrial Pressure**: This would also decrease due to reduced venous return.
   - **Pulmonary Capillary Wedge Pressure (PCWP)**: This would decrease as well, as it reflects left atrial pressure, which is affected by left ventricular filling.
   - **Diastolic Filling Time**: This may be reduced due to an increased heart rate as a compensatory mechanism.

Given these considerations, the most appropriate answer to the question regarding the changes that would occur with the maneuver of standing from a supine position is:

**(E) A reduction in diastolic filling time.**

This is because the increased heart rate compensating for the decreased preload leads to a shorter diastolic filling time.

Question: A 24-year-old Asian woman comes to the office complaining of fatigue. She states that for weeks she has noticed a decrease in her energy. She is a spin instructor, and she has been unable to teach. She said that when she was bringing groceries up the stairs yesterday she experienced some breathlessness and had to rest after ascending 1 flight. She denies chest pain, palpitations, or dyspnea at rest. She has occasional constipation. She recently became vegan 3 months ago following a yoga retreat abroad. The patient has no significant medical history and takes no medications. She was adopted, and her family history is non-contributory. She has never been pregnant. Her last menstrual period was 3 days ago, and her periods are regular. She is sexually active with her boyfriend of 2 years and uses condoms consistently. She drinks a glass of red wine each evening with dinner. She denies tobacco use or other recreational drug use. Her temperature is 99°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 104/74 mmHg and pulse is 95/min. Oxygen saturation is 98% while breathing ambient air. On physical examination, bilateral conjunctiva are pale. Her capillary refill is 3 seconds. A complete blood count is drawn, as shown below:

Hemoglobin: 10 g/dL
Hematocrit: 32%
Leukocyte count: 10,000/mm^3 with normal differential
Platelet count: 200,000/mm^3

A peripheral smear shows hypochromic red blood cells and poikilocytosis. A hemoglobin electrophoresis reveals a minor reduction in hemoglobin A2. Which of the following is most likely to be seen on the patient’s iron studies? (D) D (C) C (E) E (B) B (A) A
Reason: The answer is (C) because the patient’s symptoms and laboratory findings are consistent with iron deficiency anemia, likely due to her recent dietary change to veganism. In iron studies for iron deficiency anemia, one would typically expect a low serum iron, low ferritin, and high total iron-binding capacity (TIBC). These iron profile changes correlate with the hypochromic and microcytic characteristics noted in the peripheral blood smear alongside her fatigue and pallor.
Answer: (C) C

Question: A 34-year-old woman with beta-thalassemia major is brought to the physician because of a 2-month history of fatigue, darkening of her skin, and pain in her ankle joints. She has also had increased thirst and frequent urination for 2 weeks. She receives approximately 5 blood transfusions every year; her last transfusion was 3 months ago. Physical examination shows hyperpigmented skin, scleral icterus, pale mucous membranes, and a liver span of 17 cm. Which of the following serum findings is most likely in this patient? (D) Elevated transferrin (A) Elevated hepcidin (C) Decreased transferrin saturation (B) Elevated ferritin (E) Decreased haptoglobin
Reason: The answer is (B) Elevated ferritin because in patients with beta-thalassemia major, frequent blood transfusions lead to iron overload, resulting in elevated serum ferritin levels. This patient’s symptoms of fatigue, hyperpigmentation, and joint pain, alongside the history of multiple transfusions, indicate secondary hemochromatosis, which is associated with increased ferritin and iron storage in tissues, hence explaining the elevated ferritin level.

Question: A 54-year-old man is referred to a tertiary care hospital with a history of 5 months of progressive difficulty in walking and left leg numbness. He first noticed mild gait unsteadiness and later developed gradual right leg weakness. His left leg developed progressive numbness and tingling. His blood pressure is 138/88 mm Hg, the heart rate is 72/min, and the temperature is 36.7°C (98.2°F). On physical examination, he is alert and oriented to person, place, and time. Cranial nerves are intact. Muscle strength is 5/5 in both upper extremities and left lower extremity, but 3/5 in the right leg with increased tone. The plantar reflex is extensor on the right. Pinprick sensation is decreased on the left side below the umbilicus. Vibration and joint position senses are decreased in the right foot and leg. All sensations are normal in the upper extremities. Finger-to-nose and heel-to-shin testing are normal. This patient’s lesion is most likely located in which of the following parts of the nervous system? (B) Left hemi-spinal cord (C) Right frontal lobe (A) Left frontal lobe (D) Right hemi-spinal cord (E) Right pons
Reason: The answer is (D) Right hemi-spinal cord because the clinical presentation suggests a classic case of Brown-Séquard syndrome, characterized by unilateral weakness and sensory deficits. The right leg weakness (indicating motor involvement on the same side) and the left sensory deficits (decreased pinprick sensation, while other modalities are relatively intact) correspond to a lesion affecting the right side of the spinal cord, disrupting the corticospinal tract (responsible for motor function) and the spinothalamic tract (responsible for pain and temperature sensation).

Question: A 29-year-old man comes to the physician for worsening restlessness over the past several days. Three weeks ago, he was started on trifluoperazine for the treatment of schizophrenia. He reports that, since then, he has often felt compelled to pace around his house and is unable to sit or stand still. He is switched to an alternative antipsychotic medication. Four weeks later, the patient reports improvement of his symptoms but says that he has developed increased drowsiness, blurred vision, and dry mouth. The patient was most likely switched to which of the following drugs? (C) Trimipramine (B) Chlorpromazine (A) Metoclopramide (E) Haloperidol (D) Fluphenazine
Reason: The answer is (B) Chlorpromazine because the patient’s worsening restlessness (akathisia) after starting trifluoperazine, a typical antipsychotic, suggests he was experiencing side effects typical of this class of medications. Chlorpromazine is another antipsychotic that, while still classified as a typical antipsychotic, has a more sedating profile and is often used to manage symptoms of psychosis while potentially reducing some of the more stimulating side effects associated with other agents like trifluoperazine, thus explaining the patient's subsequent symptoms of drowsiness.

Question: A 2-day-old infant dies of severe respiratory distress following a gestation complicated by persistent oligohydramnios. Upon examination at autopsy, the left kidney is noted to selectively lack cortical and medullary collecting ducts. From which of the following embryological structures do the cortical and medullary collecting ducts arise? (B) Mesonephros (D) Metanephric mesenchyme (E) Ureteric bud (C) Paramesonephric duct (A) Pronephros
Reason: The answer is (E) Ureteric bud because the collecting ducts of the kidney, including both the cortical and medullary segments, develop from the ureteric bud, which is an outgrowth of the mesonephric duct. During embryonic development, the ureteric bud interacts with the metanephric mesenchyme to form the final structures of the kidney, including the collecting ducts, thereby explaining the observed absence of these structures in the affected kidney of the infant.

Question: A 60-year-old woman with ovarian cancer comes to the physician with a 5-day history of fever, chills, and dyspnea. She has a right subclavian chemoport in which she last received chemotherapy 2 weeks ago. Her temperature is 39.5°C (103.1°F), blood pressure is 110/80 mm Hg, and pulse is 115/min. Cardiopulmonary examination shows jugular venous distention and a new, soft holosystolic murmur heard best in the left parasternal region. Crackles are heard at both lung bases. Echocardiography shows a vegetation on the tricuspid valve. Peripheral blood cultures taken from this patient is most likely to show which of the following findings? (C) Gram-positive, catalase-positive, coagulase-positive cocci in clusters (E) Gram-positive, catalase-negative, β-hemolytic, bacitracin-resistant cocci in chains (A) Gram-positive, catalase-negative, α-hemolytic, optochin-resistant cocci in chains (D) Gram-positive, catalase-negative, nonhemolytic, salt-sensitive cocci in chains (B) Gram-positive, catalase-positive, coagulase-negative, novobiocin-resistant cocci in clusters
Reason: The answer is (C) Gram-positive, catalase-positive, coagulase-positive cocci in clusters because this presentation is consistent with a diagnosis of infective endocarditis, which in this case is likely caused by Staphylococcus aureus. This organism is known to be a common pathogen associated with endocarditis in patients who have a chemoport, and it is typically found as gram-positive cocci in clusters that are catalase-positive and coagulase-positive. The presence of the vegetation on the tricuspid valve in this patient further supports this diagnosis.

Question: A 59-year-old presents with right-sided hemiparesis, right-sided sensory loss, leftward eye deviation, and slurred speech. A head CT is performed which is significant for a hyperdense lesion affecting the putamen. The patient has a history of hypertension treated with hydrochlorothiazide, but is non-adherent. Which of the following is most likely associated with the cause of this patient’s neurological deficits? (A) Thrombotic development over ruptured atherosclerotic plaque (D) Predisposed vessel rupture secondary to cortical atrophy (B) Vessel lipohyalinosis and microaneurysm formation (E) Saccular aneurysm rupture into the subarachnoid space (C) Amyloid deposition in small cortical vessels
Reason: The answer is (B) Vessel lipohyalinosis and microaneurysm formation because the hyperdense lesion in the putamen, combined with the patient’s history of untreated hypertension, is indicative of a lacunar stroke. In chronic hypertension, lipohyalinosis affects small penetrating arteries, leading to the development of small microaneurysms that can result in lacunar infarcts such as the one seen in this patient, which causes the identified neurological deficits.

Let's think step by step. The patient presents with hip pain that is progressively worsening, and she has a history of sarcoidosis. Given her symptoms and the context, one potential concern is avascular necrosis (AVN) of the hip, which can occur in patients with sarcoidosis due to corticosteroid treatment or other factors.

To determine the most sensitive test for detecting avascular necrosis of the hip, we can consider the following options:

- **Radiograph of the hip (C)**: This is often the first imaging study done, but it may not show early changes of AVN.
- **CT of the hip (A)**: This can provide more detail than a standard X-ray but is not the most sensitive for early detection.
- **MRI of the hip (B)**: MRI is the most sensitive imaging modality for detecting early changes of avascular necrosis, as it can identify changes in the bone marrow and soft tissue before they become apparent on X-rays or CT scans.
- **Radionuclide scan of the hip (D)**: This can show increased uptake in areas of increased blood flow but is not as specific or sensitive as MRI for AVN.
- **Ultrasound of the hip (E)**: This is not typically used for diagnosing AVN.

Given this information, the most sensitive test for detecting avascular necrosis of the hip in this patient is:

**Answer: (B) MRI of the hip**

Question: A 72-year-old man with coronary artery disease comes to the emergency department because of chest pain and shortness of breath for the past 3 hours. Troponin levels are elevated and an ECG shows ST-elevations in the precordial leads. Revascularization with percutaneous coronary intervention is performed, and a stent is successfully placed in the left anterior descending artery. Two days later, he complains of worsening shortness of breath. Pulse oximetry on 3L of nasal cannula shows an oxygen saturation of 89%. An x-ray of the chest shows distended pulmonary veins, small horizontal lines at the lung bases, and blunting of the costophrenic angles bilaterally. Which of the following findings would be most likely on a ventilation-perfusion scan of this patient? (B) Normal ventilation with multiple, bilateral perfusion defects (C) Matched ventilation and perfusion bilaterally (A) Increased apical ventilation with normal perfusion bilaterally (E) Normal perfusion with decreased ventilation at the right base (D) Normal perfusion with bilateral ventilation defects
Reason: The answer is (D) Normal perfusion with bilateral ventilation defects. This patient's symptoms and chest x-ray findings suggest the presence of pulmonary edema, likely due to heart failure following his recent myocardial infarction and cardiac intervention. In pulmonary edema, ventilation may be diminished due to fluid in the alveoli, leading to normal or reduced perfusion with concurrent defects in ventilation throughout the lungs.

Question: A 66-year-old man with congestive heart failure presents to the emergency department complaining of worsening shortness of breath. These symptoms have worsened over the last 3 days. He has a blood pressure of 126/85 mm Hg and heart rate of 82/min. Physical examination is notable for bibasilar crackles. A chest X-ray reveals bilateral pulmonary edema. His current medications include metoprolol succinate and captopril. You wish to add an additional medication targeted towards his symptoms. Of the following, which statement is correct regarding loop diuretics? (A) Loop diuretics decrease sodium, magnesium, and chloride but increase calcium (D) Loop diuretics can cause metabolic acidosis (B) Loop diuretics inhibit the action of the Na+/K+/Cl- cotransporter (C) Loop diuretics can cause ammonia toxicity (E) Loop diuretics can cause hyperlipidemia
Reason: The answer is (B) Loop diuretics inhibit the action of the Na+/K+/Cl- cotransporter. Loop diuretics, such as furosemide, act on the ascending limb of the loop of Henle in the kidney, where they inhibit the Na+/K+/Cl- cotransporter, leading to increased excretion of sodium, potassium, and chloride, as well as water. This mechanism effectively reduces fluid overload, which is particularly beneficial for patients experiencing symptoms of congestive heart failure and pulmonary edema, as seen in this patient.
Answer: (B) Loop diuretics inhibit the action of the Na+/K+/Cl- cotransporter

Let's analyze the situation step by step.

The patient is a 74-year-old man who has just undergone an open cholecystectomy and was extubated after showing signs of alertness. Shortly after extubation, he becomes unresponsive, and his vital signs indicate respiratory distress, with an oxygen saturation of only 73% despite being on a non-rebreather mask with 100% FiO2. 

The arterial blood gas analysis shows:
- pH 7.32 (acidic, indicating acidosis)
- PCO2 33 mm Hg (low, indicating respiratory compensation)
- PO2 73 mm Hg (low, indicating hypoxemia)
- HCO3 22 mEq/L (normal, indicating no metabolic compensation)

Given these findings, the patient is experiencing significant hypoxemia and respiratory acidosis. The low oxygen saturation and unresponsiveness indicate that he is not adequately ventilating or oxygenating, and he is likely at risk for respiratory failure.

Now, let's evaluate the options:
- (D) Close observation only: This is not appropriate given the patient's unresponsiveness and severe hypoxemia.
- (E) Start BiPAP: While BiPAP can be helpful for some patients with respiratory distress, the patient's level of unresponsiveness and severe hypoxemia suggests that he may not be able to protect his airway adequately.
- (B) Continue using the non-rebreather mask: This is not sufficient given the patient's worsening condition and lack of improvement.
- (A) Perform tracheostomy: This is an invasive procedure that is not the immediate next step in this acute situation.
- (C) Reintubate: Given the patient's unresponsiveness, severe hypoxemia, and inability to maintain adequate oxygenation, reintubation is the most appropriate next step to secure the airway and provide adequate ventilation.

Therefore, the best next step in the management of this patient is:

Chest X-ray reveals a large right-sided pleural effusion, and chest CT scan shows a large mass near the hilum of the right lung. Cytologic examination of pleural fluid shows evidence of malignancy. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis of this patient? (C) Non-small cell lung cancer (E) Metastatic lung disease (A) Pulmonary hamartoma (B) Mesothelioma (D) Small cell lung cancer
Reason: The presence of a large mass near the hilum of the right lung, recurrent episodes of bacterial pneumonia, and evidence of malignancy in the pleural fluid suggest an aggressive lung cancer. Given the patient's significant smoking history and the characteristics of the mass, small cell lung cancer is a likely diagnosis, as it is commonly associated with such pleural effusions and a tendency for recurrence. Additionally, small cell lung cancer often metastasizes early, leading to complex presentations like this one.
Answer: (D) Small cell lung cancer

Question: A 16-year-old girl is brought to the physician because she has not yet had her 1st period. She was born at 39 weeks gestation via spontaneous vaginal delivery. She is up to date on all vaccines and meeting all developmental milestones. She has no history of a serious illness and takes no medications. Physical examination shows underdeveloped breasts with scant pubic and axillary hair. Speculum examination shows a short vagina and no cervix. The remainder of the physical examination shows no abnormalities. Pelvic ultrasound shows no uterus. Which of the following is the most likely karyotype in this patient? (E) 47,XXY (A) 45,X (B) 46,XX (D) 46,XY (C) 46,XX/46,XY
Reason: The clinical presentation of this 16-year-old girl, including the absence of menstruation, underdeveloped secondary sexual characteristics, and the findings of a short vagina and no uterus on examination, is suggestive of androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS). In AIS, the individual has a male karyotype (46,XY) but external female characteristics due to the body's inability to respond to androgens, which aligns with the findings of a lack of typical female anatomy such as a uterus and cervix. Thus, the most likely karyotype in this patient is 46,XY.
Answer: (D) 46,XY

Question: A 2-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his parents because of difficulty walking and cold feet for the past 2 months. His parents report that he tires quickly from walking. The patient was born at 37 weeks' gestation and has met all developmental milestones. There is no personal or family history of serious illness. He is at the 50th percentile for height and 40th percentile for weight. His temperature is 36.9°C (98.4°F), pulse is 119/min, respirations are 32/min, and blood pressure is 135/85 mm Hg. A grade 2/6 systolic murmur is heard in the left paravertebral region. Pedal pulses are absent. Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following findings? (D) Right ventricular outflow obstruction (A) Rib notching (C) Interarm difference in blood pressure (E) Increased R wave amplitude in V5-V6 on ECG (B) Low tissue oxygenation in the legs
Reason: The clinical presentation of this 2-year-old boy, including difficulty walking, cold feet, absent pedal pulses, and hypertension, suggests a condition such as coarctation of the aorta, which can lead to reduced blood flow to the lower extremities. Consequently, the decreased perfusion to the legs would result in low tissue oxygenation, explaining his symptoms of cold feet and fatigue while walking. Therefore, low tissue oxygenation in the legs is a likely finding.
Answer: (B) Low tissue oxygenation in the legs

Question: A 41-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of fatigue, worsening abdominal discomfort, and progressive swelling of his legs for 3 months. The swelling is worse in the evenings. His only medication is ibuprofen for occasional joint pain. The patient does not smoke and drinks 2–3 beers each weekend. His temperature is 36°C (96.8°F), pulse is 88/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg. Pulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. Abdominal examination shows a mildly distended abdomen with shifting dullness. The liver is palpated 2–3 cm below the right costal margin. When pressure is applied to the right upper quadrant, the patient's jugular veins become visibly distended for 15 seconds. The 2nd and 3rd metacarpophalangeal joints of both hands are tender to palpation. There is 2+ edema in the lower extremities. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's edema? (C) Reduced glomerular filtration rate (E) Macrovesicular steatosis of the liver (D) Dermal deposition of glycosaminoglycans (A) Impaired hepatic protein synthesis (B) Impaired relaxation of the right ventricle
Reason: The patient's symptoms, including fatigue, abdominal discomfort, progressive leg swelling, and notable jugular vein distention, suggest signs of heart failure, specifically right-sided heart failure. Impaired relaxation of the right ventricle can lead to elevated pressures in the venous system, causing peripheral edema in the legs and potentially contributing to abdominal distension due to ascites, which aligns well with the clinical findings. Thus, impaired relaxation of the right ventricle is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's edema.
Answer: (B) Impaired relaxation of the right ventricle

Question: A 10-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his parents because they are concerned about his “strange behavior”. The parents state that he has always been a lonely kid without many friends, but recently he has been having behavioral problems that seem to be unprovoked and are occurring more frequently. The child throws tantrums for no reason and does not respond to punishment or reward. He also has a “strange obsession” with collecting rocks that he finds on his way to and from school to the point where his room is filled with rocks. He plays alone in his room, lining the rocks up, organizing them by size, shape, or color, and he will randomly bark or make high-pitched noises without provocation. His teachers say he daydreams a lot and is very good at art, being able to recreate his favorite cartoon characters in great detail. On physical assessment, the patient does not make eye contact with the physician but talks incessantly about his rock collection. The child’s grammar and vocabulary seem normal but his speech is slightly labored, and he can’t seem to tell that the physician is not really interested in hearing about his rock collection. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? (E) Pick disease (A) Autism spectrum disorder (C) Tourette’s syndrome (D) Obsessive-compulsive disorder (B) Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
Reason: The child's behaviors, such as difficulty with social interactions, repetitive play focused on collecting and organizing rocks, lack of eye contact, and obsessively discussing his interests, align with the characteristics of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Additionally, the presence of unusual vocalizations and the description of him as a loner further support the diagnosis, as individuals with ASD often display social communication deficits and restricted interests or repetitive behaviors. Therefore, Autism Spectrum Disorder is the most likely diagnosis in this case.
Answer: (A) Autism spectrum disorder

Question: A 14-year-old boy is brought to a child psychiatry office by his father, who is concerned about his grades and teachers’ comments that he has “problems focusing.” He has a B- average. The boy's teachers in math, social studies, and English say that he often appears to not be listening in class, instead talking to classmates, making jokes, and blurting out incorrect answers. He typically turns in his homework late or not at all. During other classes (band and science, which he enjoys), none of these behaviors are observed. At home, he enjoys playing chess and reads comic and fiction books for hours without pause. His father describes him as calm and organized at home. Formal testing reveals an intelligence quotient (IQ) of 102. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this patient’s grades? (B) Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (E) Reduced interest (C) Intellectual disability (D) Mood disorder (A) Absence seizures
Reason: The boy exhibits selective behavioral patterns, with attention issues primarily noted in subjects that he finds less engaging, indicating that he is likely not genuinely interested in those classes rather than having a disorder such as ADHD. His ability to focus intensely on activities he enjoys, such as chess and reading, suggests that reduced interest in certain academic subjects, rather than attentional deficits or cognitive impairments, is the primary explanation for his grades. Therefore, reduced interest is the most likely explanation for this patient's academic performance.
Answer: (E) Reduced interest

Question: A physician attempts to study cirrhosis in his state. Using a registry of admitted patients over the last 10 years at the local hospital, he isolates all patients who have been diagnosed with cirrhosis. Subsequently, he contacts this group of patients, asking them to complete a survey assessing their prior exposure to alcohol use, intravenous drug abuse, blood transfusions, personal history of cancer, and other medical comorbidities. An identical survey is given to an equal number of patients in the registry who do not carry a prior diagnosis of cirrhosis. Which of the following is the study design utilized by this physician? (D) Meta-analysis (E) Randomized controlled trial (B) Cohort study (A) Case-control study (C) Cross-sectional study
Reason: This study design is classified as a case-control study because the physician identifies two groups: patients with cirrhosis (cases) and patients without cirrhosis (controls) and then assesses their past exposures and medical histories retrospectively. The focus on comparing the two distinct groups based on their prior experiences and health backgrounds distinguishes this design from cohort, cross-sectional, or randomized controlled trials. Thus, the correct designation for this study is a case-control study.
Answer: (A) Case-control study

Let's think step by step. The patient is classified as pre-diabetic, and the goal is to increase insulin sensitivity to help manage her blood glucose levels and reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.

1. **Catecholamines (A)**: These hormones (like epinephrine) generally promote gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis, which can decrease insulin sensitivity.

2. **TNF-alpha (E)**: This cytokine is associated with inflammation and is known to decrease insulin sensitivity.

3. **Glucocorticoids (C)**: These hormones (like cortisol) can increase blood glucose levels and decrease insulin sensitivity.

4. **Glucagon (B)**: This hormone increases blood glucose levels by promoting gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis, which does not help with insulin sensitivity.

5. **Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (D)**: This is a nuclear receptor that, when activated, increases insulin sensitivity and is a target for certain diabetes medications (like thiazolidinediones).

Given this analysis, the correct answer is:

**Answer: (D) Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma**

Question: A 61-year-old G4P3 presents with a 5-year history of involuntary urine loss on coughing, sneezing, and physical exertion. She denies urine leakage at night. She has been menopausal since 51 years of age. She is otherwise healthy and is not on any medications, including hormone replacement therapy. The weight is 78 kg (172 lb) and the height is 156 cm (5.1 ft). The vital signs are within normal limits. The physical examination shows no costovertebral angle tenderness. The neurologic examination is unremarkable. The gynecologic examination revealed pale and thin vulvar and vaginal mucosa. The external urethral opening appears normal; there is urine leakage when the patient is asked to cough. The Q-tip test is positive. The bimanual exam reveals painless bulging of the anterior vaginal wall. Which of the following findings are most likely to be revealed by cystometry? (E) Normal residual volume, no involuntary detrusor contractions (A) Normal residual volume, involuntary detrusor contractions on maximal bladder filling (D) Increased residual volume, involuntary detrusor contractions on maximal bladder filling (C) Normal residual volume, involuntary detrusor contractions on minimal bladder filling (B) Increased residual volume, no involuntary detrusor contractions
Reason: The answer is (E) Normal residual volume, no involuntary detrusor contractions, because the patient's symptoms are consistent with stress urinary incontinence, which typically does not involve involuntary detrusor contractions. Cystometry in such cases usually shows a normal residual volume since the bladder is functioning adequately to empty, and there are no involuntary contractions present at the time of pressure testing.
Answer: (E) Normal residual volume, no involuntary detrusor contractions

Question: A 19-year-old woman undergoes an laparoscopic appendectomy for acute appendicitis. During the procedure, a black, discolored liver is noted. Other than the recent appendicitis, the patient has no history of serious illness and takes no medications. She has no medication allergies. She does not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. She has an uncomplicated postoperative course. At her follow-up visit 3 weeks later, her vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows scleral icterus, which the patient states has been present for many years. Abdominal examination shows healing scars without drainage or erythema. Serum studies show:
Aspartate aminotransferase 30 IU/L
Alanine aminotransferase 35 IU/L
Alkaline phosphatase 47 mg/dL
Total bilirubin 5.2 mg/dL
Direct bilirubin 4.0 mg/dL
Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?" (A) Type II Crigler-Najjar syndrome (E) Wilson disease (C) Gilbert syndrome (D) Rotor syndrome (B) Dubin-Johnson syndrome
Reason: The answer is (B) Dubin-Johnson syndrome because the patient presents with isolated conjugated hyperbilirubinemia (elevated direct bilirubin) and a black liver noted during surgery, which are characteristic features of this condition. Dubin-Johnson syndrome results from a genetic defect in the hepatic excretion of conjugated bilirubin, leading to its accumulation without significant elevation of liver enzymes, as seen in this patient’s laboratory results.
Answer: (B) Dubin-Johnson syndrome

Question: A 4-month-old girl is seen for ongoing lethargy and vomiting. She was born to a 31-year-old G2P2 mother with a history of hypertension. She has had 7 episodes of non-bloody, non-bilious vomiting and 3 wet diapers over the last 24 hours. Laboratory results are shown below.

Serum:
Na+: 132 mEq/L
Cl-: 100 mEq/L
K+: 3.2 mEq/L
HCO3-: 27 mEq/L
BUN: 13 mg/dL
Glucose: 30 mg/dL
Lactate: 2 mmol/L
Urine ketones: < 20 mg/dL

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? (D) Medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (C) Sphingomyelinase deficiency (B) Glucocerebrosidase deficiency (E) Galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase deficiency (A) Glucose-6-phosphatase deficiency
Reason: The answer is (D) Medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD) because the infant's symptoms of lethargy and vomiting, along with the laboratory findings of hypoglycemia (glucose 30 mg/dL) and low urine ketones, suggest an inability to adequately metabolize fatty acids. In MCADD, episodes of fasting or increased energy demands can lead to hypoglycemia and the lack of ketones indicates that the body is not able to utilize fat stores for energy, which is consistent with the child's presentation.
Answer: (D) Medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency

Question: A 36-year-old male suffered a gun-shot wound to the abdomen that required an emergent exploratory laparotomy to repair and resect damaged portions of the bowel. Four days later, the patient reports increased generalized abdominal pain. His vital signs are as follows: T 38.5, HR 110, BP 110/60, RR 18, SpO2 96%. Physical exam reveals extreme tenderness to palpation of the abdomen as well as rebound tenderness, worse in the bilateral lower quadrants. The abdomen is mildly distended with guarding and decreased bowel sounds. The surgical and bullet-entrance wounds appear intact without any evidence of leakage/drainage, erythema, or warmth. Initial lab-work shows an elevated white blood cell count of 17.1 x 10^9 cells/L. A CT scan of the abdomen shows a 4 cm abscess in the left lower quadrant. Which of the following organisms is the most likely cause of this patient's current presentation? (E) Streptococcus bovis (B) Salmonella enteritidis (C) Bacteroides fragilis (D) Enterococcus species (A) Pseudomonas aeruginosa
Reason: The answer is (C) Bacteroides fragilis because it is a common organism associated with intra-abdominal infections, particularly following bowel surgery or trauma due to its prevalence in the gut flora. Given the patient's presentation of post-operative abdominal pain, fever, elevated white blood cell count, and the presence of a left lower quadrant abscess, which is consistent with anaerobic infections, Bacteroides fragilis is the most likely causative organism.
Answer: (C) Bacteroides fragilis

Question: A 57-year-old female visits her primary care physician with 2+ pitting edema in her legs. She takes no medications and does not use alcohol, tobacco, or illicit drugs. 4.5 grams of protein are collected during 24-hour urine excretion. A kidney biopsy is obtained. Examination with light microscopy shows diffuse thickening of the glomerular basement membrane. Electron microscopy shows subepithelial spike and dome deposits. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis: (B) Postinfectious glomerulonephritis (C) Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (D) Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (E) Membranous nephropathy (A) Minimal change disease
Reason: The answer is (E) Membranous nephropathy because the clinical presentation of nephrotic syndrome (evidenced by significant proteinuria of 4.5 grams per day) alongside the biopsy findings of diffuse thickening of the glomerular basement membrane and subepithelial spike and dome deposits on electron microscopy are characteristic of this condition. Moreover, membranous nephropathy is often associated with nephrotic syndrome in adults, making it a likely diagnosis in this scenario.

Question: A 45-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after being found down outside of a bar. He does not have any identifying information and is difficult to arouse. On presentation, his temperature is 101.2°F (38.4°C), blood pressure is 109/72 mmHg, pulse is 102/min, and respirations are 18/min. Physical exam reveals an ill-appearing and disheveled man with labored breathing and coughing productive of viscous red sputum. Lung auscultation demonstrates consolidation of the left upper lobe of the patient. Given these findings, cultures are obtained and broad spectrum antibiotics are administered. Which of the following agar types should be used to culture the most likely organism in this case? (D) Löwenstein-Jensen agar (C) Eaton agar (A) Blood agar (B) Charcoal yeast extract agar (E) MacConkey agar
Reason: The answer is (E) MacConkey agar because the patient's presentation, including productive cough with viscous red sputum and consolidation in the left upper lobe, is suggestive of pneumonia caused by a gram-negative organism such as Klebsiella pneumoniae, which is known to produce such sputum characteristics. MacConkey agar is specifically designed to isolate and differentiate gram-negative bacteria, particularly those in the family Enterobacteriaceae, making it the most appropriate choice for culturing in this clinical scenario.

Question: A 66-year-old man weighing 50 kg (110 lb) is admitted to the hospital because of sepsis complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome. The physician decides to initiate total parenteral nutrition and prescribes short-term hypocaloric intake of 20 kcal/kg/day with 20% of the total energy requirement provided by proteins and 30% provided by fats. The physician calculates that a total volume of 1100 mL/day should be infused during the parenteral nutrition therapy to maintain fluid balance. A colloid containing 10 g/dL of albumin and an emulsion with a fat concentration of 33 g/dL are used to prepare parenteral nutrition modules. Which of the following is the most appropriate module to meet the carbohydrate requirement in this patient over the next 24 hours? (C) 750 mL of 25% dextrose solution (D) 750 mL of 10% dextrose solution (A) 500 mL of 10% dextrose solution (B) 250 mL of 50% dextrose solution (E) 500 mL of 25% dextrose solution
Reason: The answer is (E) 500 mL of 25% dextrose solution because the patient's prescribed caloric intake is 20 kcal/kg/day, which amounts to 1000 kcal per day for a 50 kg man. Since 50% of the total caloric intake should come from carbohydrates (the remaining calories from protein and fat), this means 500 kcal should be derived from carbohydrates. A 25% dextrose solution provides approximately 100 kcal per 100 mL (or 1 kcal/mL), thus 500 mL would provide the required 500 kcal from carbohydrates.
Answer: (E) 500 mL of 25% dextrose solution

Question: A 35-year-old woman presents to an outpatient clinic during winter for persistant rhinorrhea. She states it is persistent and seems to be worse when she goes outside. Otherwise, she states she is generally healthy and only has a history of constipation. Her temperature is 98.7°F (37.1°C), blood pressure is 144/91 mmHg, pulse is 82/min, respirations are 14/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Nasal sputum cytology reveals eosinophilia and boggy turbinates. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? (D) Staphylococcus aureus (B) Coronavirus (A) Cold weather (E) Streptococcus pneumonia (C) Environmental allergen
Reason: The answer is (C) Environmental allergen because the patient's persistent rhinorrhea that worsens with outdoor exposure, combined with the findings of eosinophilia in nasal sputum cytology and boggy turbinates, strongly suggest an allergic response. Eosinophilia and the symptoms of nasal congestion and rhinorrhea are characteristic of allergic rhinitis, which is commonly triggered by environmental allergens such as pollen, dust, or molds.
Answer: (C) Environmental allergen

Let's analyze the information step by step.

1. **Patient Presentation**: The 21-year-old woman presents with right arm pain, limited range of motion, diarrhea, nausea, and pain during intercourse. She has vague abdominal tenderness and a history of multiple ER visits for similar symptoms.

2. **Symptoms**: The combination of arm pain without trauma, gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea and nausea), and pelvic pain (pain during intercourse) suggests a complex presentation. The absence of erythema or edema in the arm indicates that the pain may not be due to a physical injury.

3. **History of Visits**: The fact that she has been to the ER multiple times for similar symptoms suggests a chronic issue rather than an acute medical condition.

4. **Diagnosis Options**:
   - **(D) Somatoform pain disorder**: This involves experiencing pain that cannot be fully explained by a medical condition, but it is more focused on pain as the primary symptom.
   - **(B) Illness anxiety disorder**: This involves excessive worry about having a serious illness, which does not seem to fit her presentation.
   - **(E) Conversion disorder**: This involves neurological symptoms (like weakness or paralysis) that cannot be explained by medical conditions, but her symptoms are more somatic and diffuse.
   - **(C) Somatization disorder**: This involves multiple physical complaints that cannot be fully explained by a medical condition, which aligns with her history of multiple symptoms and ER visits.
   - **(A) Ulcerative colitis**: While she has gastrointestinal symptoms, the arm pain and the nature of her visits suggest a more psychological component.

5. **Conclusion**: Given her history of multiple symptoms, the lack of a clear medical explanation for her physical complaints, and the chronic nature of her visits, the most fitting diagnosis is **(C) Somatization disorder**. 

**Final Answer**: (C) Somatization disorder

Question: A 38-year-old woman comes to the physician for a 6-week history of sleeping difficulties because she thinks that someone is watching her through security cameras. Her anxiety started 6 weeks ago when a security camera was installed outside her house by the police. Ever since, she has felt that she is being monitored by security cameras throughout the city. She avoids going outside whenever possible and refuses to take the subway. Whenever she needs to leave the house she wears large hats or hooded sweaters so that she cannot be recognized by the cameras. As soon as she arrives at her office or at home she feels safer. She was recently promoted to the team manager of a small advertising agency. She takes no medications. On mental status examination, she is alert, oriented, and shows normal range of affect. Urine toxicology screening is negative. The patient's symptoms are best described as which of the following? (C) Derealization (D) Disorganized thoughts (E) Hallucinations (B) Delusions (A) Agoraphobia
Reason: The patient's belief that she is being watched through security cameras despite no evidence to support this is indicative of a delusion, which is defined as a firmly held false belief. Her avoidance of going outside due to this belief further reinforces that her symptoms align with delusional thinking rather than other psychiatric conditions, as her thoughts are not related to a misperception of reality in the conventional sense.

Question: A researcher is studying receptors that respond to epinephrine in the body and discovers a particular subset that is expressed in presynaptic adrenergic nerve terminals. She discovers that upon activation, these receptors will lead to decreased sympathetic nervous system activity. She then studies the intracellular second messenger changes that occur when this receptor is activated. She records these changes and begins searching for analogous receptor pathways. Which of the following receptors would cause the most similar set of intracellular second messenger changes? (D) Muscarinic cholinoreceptors in the gastrointestinal tract (E) Vasopressin receptors in the kidney (A) Aldosterone receptors in the kidney (C) Growth hormone receptors in the musculoskeletal system (B) Dopamine receptors in the brain
Reason: The presynaptic adrenergic receptors mentioned in the question likely belong to the alpha-2 adrenergic receptor subtype, which inhibits the release of norepinephrine and decreases sympathetic activity. Dopamine receptors, particularly the D2 subtype, also function via similar intracellular signaling pathways that involve inhibiting adenylate cyclase and reducing cyclic AMP levels, leading to comparable effects on neurotransmitter release and sympathetic nervous system activity.

Question: A 28-year-old woman presents to a psychiatrist with a 10-year history of unexplained anxiety symptoms. To date, she has not visited any psychiatrist, because she believes that she should not take medicines to change her emotions or thoughts. However, after explaining the nature of her disorder, the psychiatrist prescribes daily alprazolam. When she comes for her first follow-up, she reports excellent relief from her symptoms without any side-effects. The psychiatrist encourages her to continue her medication for the next 3 months and then return for a follow-up visit. After 3 months, she tells her psychiatrist that she has been experiencing excessive sedation and drowsiness over the last few weeks. The psychiatrist finds that she is taking alprazolam in the correct dosage, and she is not taking any other medication that causes sedation. Upon asking her about any recent changes in her lifestyle, she mentions that for the last 2 months, she has made a diet change. The psychiatrist tells her that diet change may be the reason why she is experiencing excessive sedation and drowsiness. Which of the following is the most likely diet change the psychiatrist is talking about? (E) Daily consumption of grapefruit juice (B) Daily consumption of cruciferous vegetables (C) Daily consumption of charcoal-broiled foods (D) Daily consumption of St. John's wort (A) Daily consumption of tomatoes
Reason: The excessive sedation and drowsiness reported by the patient can be attributed to her daily consumption of grapefruit juice, which is known to inhibit the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme in the liver. Alprazolam, being metabolized by this enzyme, can have increased plasma levels when grapefruit juice is consumed, leading to heightened sedation and differing effects than initially experienced.

Question: A 62-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his wife for high blood pressure readings at home. He is asymptomatic. He has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia for which he takes atenolol and atorvastatin, however, his wife reports that he recently ran out of atenolol and has not been able to refill it due to lack of health insurance. His temperature is 36.8°C (98.2°F), the pulse 65/min, the respiratory rate 22/min, and the blood pressure 201/139 mm Hg. He has no papilledema on fundoscopic examination. A CT scan shows no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or ischemia. Of the following, what is the next best step? (E) Admit him to the ICU and start intravenous medication to reduce blood pressure by 25% in the first 4 hours (B) Start or restart low-dose medication to reduce blood pressure aggressively over the next 24–48 hours (D) Admit him to the ICU and start intravenous medication to reduce blood pressure by 10% in the first hour (C) Start high-dose medication to bring his blood pressure to under 140/90 within 24 hours (A) Start or restart low-dose medication to reduce blood pressure gradually over the next 24–48 hours
Reason: The scenario describes a patient with severely elevated blood pressure (211/139 mm Hg) but without any acute end-organ damage or symptoms suggestive of hypertensive emergency. Therefore, the appropriate management is to start or restart low-dose oral antihypertensive medication to gradually lower the blood pressure over the next 24–48 hours, as aggressive or rapid reductions can lead to complications, especially in patients without end-organ damage.
Answer: (A) Start or restart low-dose medication to reduce blood pressure gradually over the next 24–48 hours

Question: A 46-year-old man comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Current medications include metformin and lisinopril. He reports that he has adhered to his diet and medication regimen. His hemoglobin A1c is 8.6%. Insulin glargine is added to his medication regimen. Which of the following sets of changes is most likely to occur in response to this new medication?
$$$ Glycolysis %%% Glycogenesis %%% Lipolysis %%% Gluconeogenesis $$$ (B) ↑ ↑ ↓ ↓ (C) ↓ ↓ ↑ ↑ (D) ↓ ↑ ↓ ↑ (A) ↑ ↓ ↑ ↓ (E) ↑ ↓ ↑ ↑
Reason: The addition of insulin glargine to the patient's regimen is intended to promote glucose uptake by cells, thereby increasing glycolysis and glycogenesis while decreasing lipolysis and gluconeogenesis. Insulin facilitates the conversion of glucose to glycogen for storage (glycogenesis) and promotes energy production through glycolysis, while it inhibits the breakdown of fats (lipolysis) and the production of new glucose from non-carbohydrate sources (gluconeogenesis).

Question: A 14-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his mom after she found him complaining of headaches, nausea, lightheadedness, and muscle pain. He has had type I diabetes for 3 years with very well managed blood sugars, and he is otherwise healthy. He recently returned from a boy scout skiing trip where he drank from a mountain stream, ate unusual foods, and lived in a lodge with a wood-fired fireplace and cooking stove. On physical exam he has a diffuse redness of his skin. Which of the following changes to this patient's pulmonary system would cause oxygen to exhibit similar transport dynamics as the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms? (A) Interstitial fibrosis (E) Nitrous oxide administration (C) Increasing capillary transit time (B) Interstitial thinning (D) Increasing capillary length
Reason: The patient's symptoms, including headache, nausea, lightheadedness, muscle pain, and the diffuse redness of the skin, suggest possible carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning, given his recent exposure to a wood-fired stove. In the context of CO toxicity, interstitial fibrosis in the lungs could reduce the effective surface area for gas exchange, paralleling how CO interferes with the transport and binding of oxygen to hemoglobin, ultimately impairing oxygen delivery to tissues.
Answer: (A) Interstitial fibrosis

Let's think step by step. The scenario describes a 12-year-old boy with a spontaneous nosebleed (epistaxis) from the left nostril, which is common in children and often due to local trauma or dryness. 

1. **Initial Management**: The first step in managing a nosebleed is to control the bleeding. The recommended initial approach is to have the patient sit up, lean forward slightly, and pinch the nostrils together for about 10 minutes. This helps to apply pressure to the bleeding site and allows for clot formation.

2. **Options Analysis**:
   - (B) Oxymetazoline nasal spray: This can help constrict blood vessels but is not the first-line initial therapy.
   - (A) Anterior packing and topical antibiotics: This is more invasive and typically used if initial measures fail.
   - (C) Placement of an epinephrine gauze in the left nostril: This is also more advanced and not the first step.
   - (D) Silver nitrate cauterization: This is used for persistent bleeding but is not the first step.
   - (E) Squeezing the nostrils manually for 10 minutes with the head elevated: This is the correct initial management for a nosebleed.

Given this reasoning, the most appropriate initial therapy is:

**Answer: (E) Squeezing the nostrils manually for 10 minutes with the head elevated.**

Question: A 57-year-old female presents to her primary care physician with a chief complaint of feeling tired all the time. She states her symptoms began several months ago, around the time that her husband committed suicide. Since then she has had thoughts of joining her husband. She complains of feeling excessively weak and states that she no longer has enough energy to go to the gym which she attributes to her 15 pound weight gain over the last month. The patient's medical history includes joint pain, a skin rash that recently resolved, obstructive sleep apnea, and metabolic syndrome. The patient takes ibuprofen and omeprazole as needed but otherwise cannot remember any other medications that she takes. On physical exam you note an overweight woman who has an overall depressed affect. The patient's cardiac exam reveals a normal rate and rhythm. The pulmonary exam reveals bilateral clear lung fields with good air movement. The patient's skin is very dry and tight appearing and her hair is coarse. Overall the patient appears somewhat unkempt.

Laboratory work is performed and reveals the following:

Hemoglobin: 13.0 g/dL
Hematocrit: 37%
Leukocyte count: 4,500 cells/mm^3 with normal differential
Platelets: 250,000/mm^3

Serum:
Na+: 140 mEq/L
K+: 4.4 mEq/L
Cl-: 102 mEq/L
BUN: 15 mg/dL
Glucose: 122 mg/dL
Creatinine: 1.0 mg/dL
Thyroid-stimulating hormone: 5.3 µU/mL
Ca2+: 10.2 mg/dL
AST: 11 U/L
ALT: 13 U/L

Which of the following laboratory findings is most likely to be abnormal in this patient? (A) Anti-DNA topoisomerase antibodies (E) 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid in CSF (C) Anti-histidyl-tRNA synthetase antibodies (D) Anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies (B) Anti-nuclear antibodies
Reason: The answer is (D) Anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies. This patient presents with signs and symptoms suggestive of hypothyroidism, such as fatigue, weight gain, dry skin, and coarse hair, alongside a slightly elevated TSH level (5.3 µU/mL), which indicates possible thyroid dysfunction. The presence of anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies would support a diagnosis of Hashimoto's thyroiditis, an autoimmune condition that is commonly associated with hypothyroidism.

Question: A 60-year-old man presents with severe chronic neck pain. 6 months ago, the patient was in a motor vehicle accident where he sustained a severe whiplash injury. Initial radiographs were negative for fractures, and he was treated with cyclobenzaprine and tramadol and discharged with outpatient follow-up. He says that despite being compliant with his medication, the pain is not going away. It keeps him up at night and prevents him from focusing at work or at home. He also feels that none of the other doctors can help him. Past medical history includes hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and gout for which he takes chlorthalidone, atorvastatin, and allopurinol. He has no family and lives alone. He has never attempted to take his life but thinks that it might be better than living in pain forever. He has a gun at home and plans to commit suicide in the near future. Which of the following is the single best initial treatment option for this patient’s condition? (A) Admission into the hospital (C) Treat the the patient with outpatient psychotherapy only (E) Work with local police to confiscate the gun and release the patient home (D) Treat the patient with outpatient pharmacotherapy only (B) Treat the patient with outpatient pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy only
Reason: The answer is (A) Admission into the hospital. Given the patient's significant risk of suicide, as indicated by his thoughts of self-harm and access to a firearm, immediate hospitalization is necessary for safety and to provide appropriate psychiatric evaluation and intervention. In situations where a patient expresses suicidal ideation, prioritizing their safety through hospitalization is essential before considering any other treatment modalities.

Question: A 49-year-old man presents to his primary care physician complaining of multiple symptoms. He states that over the past 8 months he has noticed voice changes and difficulty swallowing. The dysphagia started with just dry foods like crackers but has progressed to include smoothies and ice cream. He works as a newspaper editor and has also noticed trouble writing with his dominant hand. He is accompanied by his wife, who complains that he snores and drools in his sleep. His medical history is significant for hypertension and a bicuspid aortic valve. He takes hydrochlorothiazide. On physical examination, there is atrophy of the right hand. The patient’s speech is slow. A systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border is appreciated. Tapping of the left patellar tendon causes the patient’s left lower extremity to forcefully kick out. Stroking of the plantar aspect of the patient’s left foot causes his left toes to extend upward. Which of the following therapies is most likely to slow the progression of the patient’s symptoms? (D) Reserpine (A) Amantadine (B) Beta interferon (C) Donepezil (E) Riluzole
Reason: The answer is (E) Riluzole. This patient exhibits symptoms consistent with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), including dysphagia, voice changes, and hand muscle atrophy, along with abnormal reflexes. Riluzole is the only medication approved for the treatment of ALS that has been shown to slow disease progression and extend survival, making it the most appropriate choice in this scenario.

Question: A 38-year-old woman comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. She was diagnosed with immune thrombocytopenic purpura at the age of 37 years and has been treated with glucocorticoids and intravenous immune globulin. She has visited the emergency department 3 times in the past 4 months for nose bleeds, which required cauterization. Her platelet counts on her previous visits were 18,320/mm3, 17,500/mm3, and 19,100/mm3. Current medications include dexamethasone and a multivitamin. She has no children. Her immunizations are up-to-date. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows petechiae on the bilateral lower extremities. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. The abdomen is soft and nontender; there is no organomegaly. Her hemoglobin concentration is 13.3 g/dL, leukocyte count is 8,100/mm3, and platelet count is 13,000/mm3. Her blood type is A negative. Serology for hepatitis C and HIV is negative. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? (E) Schedule splenectomy (C) Danazol therapy (B) Rituximab therapy (D) Observation and follow-up (A) Romiplostim therapy
Reason: The answer is (E) Schedule splenectomy. This patient has persistent immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) despite ongoing treatment with glucocorticoids and intravenous immune globulin, as indicated by her low platelet counts and recurrent bleeding episodes. Splenectomy is an effective treatment option for chronic ITP, as the spleen is involved in the destruction of platelets; removing it can often lead to a significant and durable increase in platelet counts.
Answer: (E) Schedule splenectomy

Question: A 62-year-old man presents to the emergency department concerned about a large amount of blood in his recent bowel movement. He states he was at home when he noticed a large amount of red blood in his stool. He is not experiencing any pain and otherwise feels well. The patient has a past medical history of diabetes and obesity. His temperature is 98.9°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 147/88 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 13/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam reveals a non-distressed man. His abdomen is non-tender, and he has normoactive bowel sounds. Stool guaiac test is positive for blood. The patient is started on IV fluids and kept nil per os. His next bowel movement 4 hours later appears grossly normal. Which of the following interventions will most likely reduce future complications in this patient? (C) Reduce red meat consumption (B) Increase fiber and fluid intake (D) Sigmoid colon resection (E) Sitz baths (A) Ciprofloxacin and metronidazole
Reason: The answer is (B) Increase fiber and fluid intake. This patient exhibits a sudden episode of bright red blood per rectum, which could suggest a bleeding source such as diverticulosis or hemorrhoids, particularly in the context of his age and past medical history. Increasing fiber and fluid intake can help prevent constipation and reduce straining during bowel movements, which may lower the risk of recurrence of diverticular disease or hemorrhoids, thereby minimizing future complications related to these conditions.

Question: A 5-year-old boy presents to the emergency department with a sore throat and trouble breathing. His mother states that his symptoms started last night and have rapidly been worsening. The patient is typically healthy, has received all his childhood immunizations, and currently takes a daily multivitamin. His temperature is 103°F (39.4°C), blood pressure is 100/64 mmHg, pulse is 155/min, respirations are 29/min, and oxygen saturation is 95% on room air. Physical exam is notable for an ill-appearing child who is drooling and is leaning forward to breathe. He does not answer questions and appears very uncomfortable. He will not comply with physical exam to open his mouth for inspection of the oropharynx. Which of the following is the most likely infectious etiology of this patient's symptoms? (D) Streptococcus pneumoniae (E) Streptococcus viridans (B) Epstein-Barr virus (A) Candidia albicans (C) Haemophilus influenzae
Reason: The answer is (C) Haemophilus influenzae. This patient's presentation, which includes drooling, respiratory distress, a high fever, and leaning forward (tripod position), is suggestive of acute epiglottitis, a life-threatening condition often caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) in unvaccinated children. Although Streptococcus pneumoniae can cause throat infections, the specific symptoms and age of the patient strongly point toward Hib as the most likely infectious etiology, particularly since immunization against Hib has significantly decreased its prevalence but remains relevant in unvaccinated populations or in cases where vaccinations are incomplete.

Question: A 23-year-old man comes to the physician because of a tremor in his right hand for the past 3 months. The tremor has increased in intensity and he is unable to perform his daily activities. When he wakes up in the morning, his pillow is soaked in saliva. During this period, he has been unable to concentrate in his college classes. He has had several falls over the past month. He has no past history of serious illness. He appears healthy. His vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows a broad-based gait. There is a low frequency tremor that affects the patient's right hand to a greater extent than his left. When the patient holds his arms fully abducted with his elbows flexed, he has a bilateral low frequency arm tremor that increases in amplitude the longer he holds his arms up. Muscle strength is normal in all extremities. Sensation is intact. Deep tendon reflexes are 4+ bilaterally. Dysmetria is present. A photograph of the patient's eye is shown. Mental status examination shows a restricted affect. The rate and rhythm of his speech is normal. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy? (D) Prednisone (E) Levodopa
" (A) Penicillamine (B) Propranolol (C) Deferoxamine
Reason: The answer is (A) Penicillamine. The presentation of this 23-year-old man, with tremors, drooling, cognitive difficulties, and a broad-based gait, is suggestive of Wilson's disease, a genetic disorder leading to copper accumulation in the body, particularly affecting the liver and brain. Penicillamine is a chelating agent that helps remove excess copper from the body, making it the appropriate choice for pharmacotherapy in the management of Wilson's disease, particularly when neurological symptoms are present.
Answer: (A) Penicillamine

Let's think step by step. 

This patient has a positive RPR and FTA-ABS, indicating a diagnosis of syphilis. Given his CD4 count of 175, he is at risk for opportunistic infections, but he currently has no neurological symptoms or signs of neurosyphilis. 

In the case of syphilis, the treatment approach depends on the stage of the disease. Since the patient has a positive RPR with a titer of 1:64, this suggests he may have early syphilis (primary or secondary), especially since he is asymptomatic and has no neurological signs.

For early syphilis, the standard treatment is a single injection of benzathine penicillin G. However, if there is any concern for neurosyphilis (which is not indicated here since the neurological examination is normal), a lumbar puncture would be warranted.

Since the patient is asymptomatic and there are no signs of CNS involvement, the most appropriate next step in management is to treat with a single injection of penicillin and then obtain titers in 6 months to monitor treatment response.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**(E) Treat with a single injection of penicillin, obtain titers in 6 months.**

Question: A 23-year-old woman presents with a 4-week menstrual delay. She also complains of irritability, increased somnolence, and occasional nausea. She had her first menarche at the age of 13, and her menstrual cycle became regular at the age of 15. She has been sexually active since the age of 20 but has had the same sexual partner since then. They stopped using birth control protection approximately 6 months ago. She does not smoke and consumes alcohol occasionally. Her blood pressure is 120/80 mm Hg, heart rate is 71/min, respiratory rate is 14/min, and temperature is 36.6℃ (98.2℉). Physical examination is significant only for slight breast engorgement and nipple pigmentation. Gynecologic examination reveals cervical softening and cyanosis. Which of the following drugs would be recommended for this patient? (C) Folic acid (B) Biphasic oral contraceptive (A) Progesterone (D) Vitamin A (E) Combination of natural estrogen and progestin
Reason: The answer is (C) Folic acid because the clinical presentation suggests that the patient is likely pregnant, given her missed menstrual period, breast changes, and cervical signs consistent with early pregnancy. Folic acid is recommended for pregnant women to help prevent neural tube defects in the developing fetus.

Question: A 6-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of worsening headaches and a rash for 2 weeks. His mother reports that the rash started on his abdomen and diffusely spread to other areas. Over the past 2 months, he has had recurrent episodes of otitis media. Examination shows a diffuse, erythematous, papular rash involving the groin, abdomen, chest, and back. His cervical lymph nodes are palpable bilaterally. An x-ray of the skull shows well-defined lytic lesions of the left occipital bone and the mastoid bone. Electron microscopy of a biopsy of the patient's posterior cervical lymph nodes shows polygonal cells with organelles shaped like tennis rackets. The cells stain positive for S-100. Clonal proliferation of which of the following types of cells is most likely seen on microscopy? (A) Natural killer cells (E) Plasma cells (B) B cells (C) Langerhans cells (D) Eosinophils
Reason: The answer is (C) Langerhans cells because the presence of polygonal cells with tennis racket-shaped organelles suggests the diagnosis of Langerhans cell histiocytosis, which is characterized by the proliferation of these specific dendritic cells. The symptoms described, such as the skin rash, recurrent infections, and bone lesions, further support this diagnosis, as they are associated with Langerhans cell involvement.

Question: A 41-year-old man presents to a New Mexico emergency department with a 12 hour history of shortness of breath and a nonproductive cough. He says that last week he experienced fevers, chills, fatigue, and myalgias but assumed that he simply had a cold. The symptoms went away after 3 days and he felt fine for several days afterward until he started experiencing shortness of breath even at rest. He works as an exterminator and recently had a job in a rodent infested home. Physical exam reveals a thin, tachypneic man with diffuse rales bilaterally. The most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is associated with which of the following? (E) Widened mediastinum on chest radiograph (A) Binding to sialic acid residues in human cells (D) Safety pin-shaped organisms on peripheral blood smear (C) Decreased serum albumin level (B) Cerebral spinal fluid pleocytosis
Reason: The answer is (C) Decreased serum albumin level because the patient's symptoms, including shortness of breath and the recent history of febrile illness, suggest a possible infection, such as hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, which can lead to pulmonary edema and a decrease in serum albumin due to increased capillary permeability. This decrease in serum albumin may contribute to the overall clinical picture of respiratory distress he is experiencing following his recent exposure to rodent droppings.
Answer: (C) Decreased serum albumin level

Let's analyze the information step by step.

The patient is a 17-year-old woman who has not had her menstrual period for 4 months, has a history of regular menses, and has recently experienced binge eating. She has enlarged cheeks (which could suggest facial swelling or "moon facies") and calluses on the dorsum of her hands, which are indicative of repeated trauma or friction, often seen in individuals who engage in binge eating and purging behaviors.

Given these findings, the most likely diagnosis is bulimia nervosa, which is characterized by episodes of binge eating followed by compensatory behaviors such as vomiting, excessive exercise, or fasting. 

In bulimia nervosa, one common physical finding is dental erosion due to the exposure of teeth to stomach acid from vomiting. Therefore, the expected finding in this patient would be:

**Answer: (C) Erosion of tooth enamel.** 

This finding aligns with the behaviors associated with bulimia nervosa and is a common consequence of the condition.

Question: A 34-year-old woman comes to the physician for a routine health maintenance examination. She has gastroesophageal reflux disease. She recently moved to a new city. Her father was diagnosed with colon cancer at age 46. Her father's brother died because of small bowel cancer. Her paternal grandfather died because of stomach cancer. She takes a vitamin supplement. Current medications include esomeprazole and a multivitamin. She smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 6 years but quit 2 years ago. She drinks one to two alcoholic beverages on weekends. She appears healthy. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Colonoscopy is unremarkable. Germline testing via DNA sequencing in this patient shows mutations in DNA repair genes MLH1 and MSH2. Which of the following will this patient most likely require at some point in her life? (B) Surgical removal of a desmoid tumor (E) Prophylactic proctocolectomy with ileoanal anastomosis (C) Celecoxib or sulindac therapy (D) Bilateral prophylactic mastectomy (A) Hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy
Reason: The patient's profile suggests a hereditary cancer syndrome, particularly Lynch syndrome (hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer), which is associated with increased risks of various cancers, including endometrial and ovarian cancers. Given her family history of colon cancer and the identified mutations in MLH1 and MSH2, a hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy may be recommended as a preventive measure to reduce the potential risk of developing these cancers.
Answer: (A) Hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy

Question: A 20-year-old woman visits the clinic for her annual physical examination. She does not have any complaints during this visit. The past medical history is insignificant. She follows a healthy lifestyle with a balanced diet and moderate exercise schedule. She does not smoke or drink alcohol. She does not take any medications currently. The family history is significant for her grandfather and uncle who had their parathyroid glands removed. The vital signs include: blood pressure:122/88 mm Hg, pulse 88/min, respirations 17/min, and temperature 36.7°C (98.0°F). The physical exam is within normal limits. The lab test results are as follows:
Blood Urea Nitrogen 12 mg/dL
Serum Creatinine 1.1 mg/dL
Serum Glucose (Random) 88 mg/dL
Serum chloride 107 mmol/L
Serum potassium 4.5 mEq/L
Serum sodium 140 mEq/L
Serum calcium 14.5 mmol/L
Serum albumin 4.4 gm/dL
Parathyroid Hormone (PTH) 70 pg/mL (Normal: 10-65 pg/mL)
24-Hr urinary calcium 85 mg/day (Normal: 100–300 mg/day)
Which of the following is the next best step in the management of this patient? (B) Start IV fluids to keep her hydrated (E) Give glucocorticoids (A) Parathyroidectomy (D) Start her on pamidronate (C) No treatment is necessary
Reason: The patient presents with hypercalcemia, indicated by a serum calcium level of 14.5 mmol/L, but her parathyroid hormone (PTH) level is elevated, suggesting primary hyperparathyroidism. However, her urinary calcium is low, which indicates that the source of the hypercalcemia may not be due to excessive PTH activity. Given the absence of symptoms and the high calcium level without significant urinary calcium loss, monitoring her condition without immediate intervention is reasonable at this stage. Thus, no treatment is necessary as long as she remains asymptomatic.

Question: A 58-year-old department store manager comes to his doctor’s office complaining that he had recently been waking up in the middle of the night with abdominal pain. This has happened several nights a week in the past month. He has also been experiencing occasional discomfort in the afternoon. The patient's appetite has suffered as a result of the pain he was experiencing. His clothes hang on him loosely. The patient does not take any prescription or over the counter medications. The remainder of the patient’s history and physical exam is completely normal. The doctor refers the patient to a gastroenterologist for a stomach acid test and an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy which revealed that this patient is a heavy acid producer and has a gastric peptic ulcer. This ulcer is most likely found in which part of the stomach? (C) Proximal gastroesophageal ulcer near the gastroesophageal junction (B) Along the lesser curve at the incisura angularis (E) Multiple sites throughout the stomach (A) In the pyloric channel within 3 cm of the pylorus (D) In the body
Reason: Gastric peptic ulcers are often associated with increased acid production, and they commonly occur in the pyloric channel, which is the area just before the duodenum. Given the patient’s history of significant acid production as identified by gastrointestinal testing, it is reasonable to conclude that his ulcer is most likely located in the pyloric channel due to the high acidity and potential for ulcer formation in that region.
Answer: (A) In the pyloric channel within 3 cm of the pylorus

Question: Two weeks after undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplant for multiple myeloma, a 55-year-old man develops a severely pruritic rash, abdominal cramps, and profuse diarrhea. He appears lethargic. Physical examination shows yellow sclerae. There is a generalized maculopapular rash on his face, trunk, and lower extremities, and desquamation of both soles. His serum alanine aminotransferase is 115 U/L, serum aspartate aminotransferase is 97 U/L, and serum total bilirubin is 2.7 mg/dL. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition? (E) Preformed cytotoxic anti-HLA antibodies (B) Newly formed anti-HLA antibodies (D) Activated recipient T cells (A) Donor T cells in the graft (C) Proliferating transplanted B cells
Reason: The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings suggest acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), which often occurs after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. This condition is characterized by the donor T cells in the graft recognizing the recipient's tissues as foreign, leading to an immune response that causes skin rash, gastrointestinal symptoms, and liver dysfunction, making donor T cells in the graft the most likely underlying cause of his condition.
Answer: (A) Donor T cells in the graft

Question: A 46-year-old woman comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. She had a blood pressure recording of 148/94 mm Hg on her previous visit one week ago. Her home blood pressure log shows readings of 151/97 and 146/92 mm Hg in the past week. She has no history of serious illness and takes no medications. She is 160 cm (5 ft 3 in) tall and weighs 52 kg (115 lb); BMI is 20 kg/m2. Her pulse is 88/min and blood pressure is 150/96 mm Hg. Cardiopulmonary examination is unremarkable. Abdominal examination shows no abnormalities. The extremities are well perfused with strong peripheral pulses. Serum concentrations of electrolytes, creatinine, lipids, TSH, and fasting glucose are within the reference range. A urinalysis is within normal limits. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? (A) Electrocardiogram (D) Echocardiography (B) Plasma renin activity (C) Polysomnography (E) Renal ultrasonography
Reason: Given the patient presents with persistently elevated blood pressure readings and no significant abnormalities in her lab work or urinalysis, it is essential to assess for any possible underlying cardiovascular issues. An electrocardiogram (ECG) is a standard initial test to evaluate cardiac health and can help identify any changes consistent with hypertension, such as left ventricular hypertrophy, making it a crucial next step in her management.
Answer: (A) Electrocardiogram

Question: A 74-year-old woman with no significant past medical history presents with 1 week of fever, unremitting headache and hip and shoulder stiffness. She denies any vision changes. Physical examination is remarkable for right scalp tenderness and range of motion is limited due to pain and stiffness. Neurological testing is normal. Laboratory studies are significant for an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) at 75 mm/h (normal range 0-22 mm/h for women). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? (A) Obtain CT head without contrast (E) Start IV methylprednisolone (D) Start oral prednisone (C) Perform a temporal artery biopsy (B) Perform a lumbar puncture
Reason: The patient's symptoms and significantly elevated ESR suggest giant cell arteritis (temporal arteritis), which is a condition associated with inflammation of the temporal arteries and can lead to complications such as vision loss. Given the presence of symptoms such as unilateral scalp tenderness, headache, and stiffness, starting oral prednisone is appropriate for immediate treatment to reduce inflammation and prevent serious complications, while a temporal artery biopsy can be performed later to confirm the diagnosis.
Answer: (D) Start oral prednisone

Question: On a medical trip to Nicaragua, you observe a sweet odor in the cerumen of 12-hour female newborn. Within 48 hours, the newborn develops ketonuria, poor feeding, and a sweet odor is also noticed in the urine. By 96 hours, the newborn is extremely lethargic and opisthotonus is observed. In order to prevent a coma and subsequent death, which of the following amino acids should be withheld from this newborn's diet? (E) Threonine (A) Phenylalanine (C) Tyrosine (D) Methionine (B) Valine
Reason: The symptoms described in the newborn — including the sweet odor of the cerumen and urine, along with ketosis and lethargy — suggest a disorder known as maple syrup urine disease (MSUD), which is characterized by an inability to metabolize certain branched-chain amino acids, including valine. In order to prevent further metabolic disturbances, including coma and potential death, it is essential to withhold valine from the newborn's diet, as it is one of the precursor amino acids that contributes to the condition.
Answer: (B) Valine

Let's think step by step. The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) has specific guidelines regarding the work hours of residents to ensure patient safety and the well-being of the residents themselves. 

1. **Current Work Hours**: The resident is currently working 60 hours per week in his residency program.
2. **External Work**: He is also working an additional 10-hour shift on Saturdays, bringing his total to 70 hours per week.
3. **ACGME Guidelines**: According to ACGME standards, residents are limited to a maximum of 80 hours of work per week, averaged over a 4-week period. This includes both residency and any moonlighting hours.
4. **Moonlighting**: Residents are allowed to moonlight, but it must not interfere with their residency training or exceed the maximum work hour limits.

Given that the resident is already working 70 hours per week, he has only 10 hours left to reach the 80-hour limit. Therefore, he cannot work more hours without exceeding the ACGME limit.

Considering these points, the most accurate statement regarding this resident’s moonlighting and patient safety is:

**Answer: (A) He is already overcommitting and must reduce the number of hours.** 

This is because he is close to the maximum allowed hours, and any additional work would exceed the ACGME's limits.

Question: A 25-year-old G1P0 gives birth to a male infant at 33 weeks’ gestation. The mother immigrated from Sudan one month prior to giving birth. She had no prenatal care and took no prenatal vitamins. She does not speak English and is unable to provide a medical history. The child’s temperature is 101.0°F (38.3°C), blood pressure is 90/50 mmHg, pulse is 140/min, and respirations are 30/min. Physical examination reveals flexed upper and lower extremities, minimal response to stimulation, and slow and irregular respirations. A murmur is best heard over the left second intercostal space. The child’s lenses appear pearly white. Which of the following classes of pathogens is most likely responsible for this patient’s condition? (A) Togavirus (D) Herpesvirus (B) Retrovirus (C) Protozoan (E) Spirochete
Reason: The symptoms described in the infant suggest congenital infection, particularly the presence of cataracts (indicated by the "pearly white" lenses) and the murmur. Togaviruses, such as the rubella virus, are known to cause congenital syndromes that include cataracts, cardiac defects, and growth restrictions, especially in instances of maternal infection during pregnancy. Given the mother's lack of prenatal care and vaccination history, rubella is a likely cause of these findings, making the choice of Togavirus (A) appropriate.

Question: A 16-year-old boy presents with acute left-sided weakness. The patient is obtunded and can not provide any history other than his stomach hurts. The patient’s friend states that the patient has had episodes like this in the past and that “he has the same weird disease as his mom”. On physical examination, strength is 1 out of 5 in the left upper and lower extremities. A noncontrast CT scan of the head is normal. Laboratory tests reveal an anion gap metabolic acidosis. Which of the following is a normal function of the structure causing this patient’s condition? (C) Conversion of pyruvate to oxaloacetate (B) Extracellular potassium homeostasis (A) Extrinsic pathway of apoptosis (D) Synthesis of globin chains of hemoglobin (E) Creation of exogenous reactive oxygen species
Reason: The combination of acute left-sided weakness, episodes of similar symptoms in the past, and metabolic acidosis suggests a potential disorder related to the metabolic function of the mitochondria. Mitochondria play a crucial role in energy metabolism, including converting pyruvate to oxaloacetate in the gluconeogenesis pathway, which is important for glucose production. Given that this patient’s symptoms may relate to a metabolic disorder, option (C), which describes a normal mitochondrial function, is the most relevant answer.
Answer: (C) Conversion of pyruvate to oxaloacetate

Question: A 31-year-old woman presents with dysuria and pain in the lower abdomen. It is the first time she has experienced such symptoms. She denies a history of any genitourinary or gynecologic diseases. The blood pressure is 120/80 mm Hg, heart rate is 78/min, respiratory rate is 13/min, and temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F). The physical examination is within normal limits. A urine culture grew the pathogens pictured. The presence of which of the following factors specifically allows this pathogen to cause urinary tract infections? (C) Heat-labile toxin (D) Heat-stable toxin (A) P-fimbriae (B) K-capsule (E) Hemolysin
Reason: P-fimbriae, or pyelonephritis-associated fimbriae, are hair-like structures on the surface of certain bacteria, particularly uropathogenic Escherichia coli, that allow them to adhere to the uroepithelial cells lining the urinary tract. This adherence is crucial for the initiation and persistence of urinary tract infections, as it enables the bacteria to resist being flushed out by urine flow during micturition. Therefore, option (A) is the correct answer since P-fimbriae specifically facilitate the colonization of the urinary tract by pathogens.
Answer: (A) P-fimbriae

Question: A 30-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1, abortus 1, comes to the physician because of failure to conceive for 12 months. She is sexually active with her husband 2–3 times per week. Her first child was born at term after vaginal delivery 2 years ago. At that time, the postpartum course was complicated by hemorrhage from retained placental products, and the patient underwent dilation and curettage. Menses occur at regular 28-day intervals and previously lasted for 5 days with normal flow, but now last for 2 days with significantly reduced flow. She stopped taking oral contraceptives 1 year after the birth of her son. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Speculum examination shows a normal vagina and cervix. The uterus is normal in size, and no adnexal masses are palpated. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? (B) Estrogen/progestin withdrawal test (D) Hysteroscopy with potential adhesiolysis (A) Measurement of antisperm antibody concentration (C) Measurement of serum FSH and LH concentrations (E) Dilation and curettage
Reason: The patient's history of retained placental products followed by dilation and curettage raises concern for possible intrauterine scarring, known as Asherman's syndrome, particularly given her current menstrual changes of reduced flow and shortened duration. Hysteroscopy allows for direct visualization of the uterine cavity and the possibility of adhesiolysis if scar tissue is present, making it the most appropriate next step in management (D) for evaluating and potentially treating her condition to facilitate conception.
Answer: (D) Hysteroscopy with potential adhesiolysis

Let's analyze the question step by step.

The patient is a 28-year-old woman who has been trying to conceive for 2 years. Given her history of prior abdominal surgery and family history of endocrine abnormalities, it is likely that she may have issues related to ovulation or hormonal imbalances. The treatment mentioned is administered intermittently one week before her normal menstrual cycle, which suggests it is likely a medication that is used to induce ovulation or regulate menstrual cycles.

In the context of fertility treatments, one common medication that fits this description is Clomiphene citrate (Clomid), which is often used to treat anovulation in women with conditions like polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). 

Now, the question asks what other condition could be treated by this drug if it were administered differently. Clomiphene citrate is not typically used for the other options listed, but it is important to note that it is not used for Parkinson's disease, diabetes, premature labor, or prostate cancer.

However, if we consider the context of treating conditions related to hormonal regulation, Clomiphene citrate can also be used in certain cases of male infertility, particularly in cases of hypogonadism, where it can stimulate the hypothalamus and pituitary to increase testosterone production.

Among the options provided, the most relevant condition that could be treated with a drug like Clomiphene citrate (if administered differently) is:

(C) Polycystic ovarian syndrome

This is because Clomiphene citrate is commonly used to treat PCOS-related infertility by inducing ovulation. 

So, the answer is:
Answer: (C) Polycystic ovarian syndrome

Question: Researchers are investigating a new mouse model of glycogen regulation. They add hepatocyte enzyme extracts to radiolabeled glucose to investigate glycogen synthesis, in particular two enzymes. They notice that the first enzyme adds a radiolabeled glucose to the end of a long strand of radiolabeled glucose. The second enzyme then appears to rearrange the glycogen structure such that there appears to be shorter strands that are linked. Which of the following pairs of enzymes in humans is most similar to the enzymes being investigated by the scientists? (C) Glycogen synthase and branching enzyme (A) Debranching enzyme and branching enzyme (D) Glycogen synthase and debranching enzyme (B) Branching enzyme and debranching enzyme (E) Glycogen phosphorylase and glycogen synthase
Reason: The pair of enzymes most similar to the ones being investigated is glycogen synthase and branching enzyme (C) because glycogen synthase is responsible for adding glucose units to the growing glycogen chain, while branching enzyme introduces α(1→6) linkages, creating branch points in the glycogen structure. This matches the observed activity of the first enzyme adding glucose to the chain and the second enzyme rearranging the glycogen to form branched structures, which are characteristic features of glycogen metabolism in humans.
Answer: (C) Glycogen synthase and branching enzyme

Question: An investigator is studying the genotypes of wingless fruit flies using full exome sequencing. Compared to wild-type winged fruit flies, the wingless fruit flies are found to have a point mutation in the gene encoding wing bud formation during embryogenesis. The point mutation in the gene causes the mRNA transcript to have a 'UUG' segment instead of an 'AUG' segment. Which of the following processes is most likely affected by this mutation? (B) Shift of peptidyl-tRNA from A to P site (A) Binding of met-tRNA to 60S complex (C) Dissociation of mRNA from ribosome complex (E) Cleavage of 5' intron (D) Catalyzation of peptide bond formation
Reason: The process most likely affected by this mutation is the binding of methionine-tRNA (met-tRNA) to the 60S ribosomal complex (A), because the point mutation changes the start codon from 'AUG' (which codes for methionine and serves as the translation initiation site) to 'UUG', a codon that does not initiate protein synthesis properly. As 'AUG' is the canonical start codon, its alteration would directly impact the ability of the ribosome to correctly recognize and bind the initiator tRNA necessary for starting translation.
Answer: (A) Binding of met-tRNA to 60S complex

Question: A 36-year-old primigravid woman at 34 weeks' gestation comes to the physician because of a 1-week history of upper abdominal discomfort, nausea, and malaise. She had a mild upper respiratory tract infection a week ago. She has a 10-year history of polycystic ovarian syndrome and a 3-year history of hypertension. Her medications include metformin, labetalol, folic acid, and a multivitamin. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 147/84 mm Hg. Examination shows a nontender uterus consistent in size with a 34-week gestation. There is mild tenderness of the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. The fetal heart rate is reactive with no decelerations. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? (C) HBsAg and IgM anti-HBc serology (B) Stool antigen assay for H. pylori (A) Serum bile acid levels (D) Reassurance and follow-up (E) Serum transaminase levels and platelet count
Reason: The most appropriate next step in management is to obtain serum transaminase levels and platelet count (E) because the patient presents with symptoms that raise concern for liver dysfunction, particularly given her history of hypertension and the timing of her pregnancy. In the context of pregnancy, especially in the third trimester, conditions such as preeclampsia and acute fatty liver of pregnancy need to be ruled out, and monitoring liver enzymes and platelet counts can provide critical information about her hepatic function and overall health.

Let's analyze the information provided step by step.

The patient is a 68-year-old man with confusion, increased somnolence, and frequent urination. His laboratory results show hypercalcemia (Ca2+ of 12.2 mg/dL) and low parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels (8 pg/mL). The combination of hypercalcemia and low PTH suggests a primary cause of hypercalcemia that is not due to primary hyperparathyroidism, such as malignancy or other conditions leading to hypercalcemia.

Given the context, the most likely cause of the patient's hypercalcemia is malignancy, possibly due to paraneoplastic syndromes (e.g., squamous cell carcinoma leading to parathyroid hormone-related peptide secretion). 

In terms of long-term management of hypercalcemia, the best option among the choices provided is to use a bisphosphonate, which helps to inhibit bone resorption and lower serum calcium levels over time.

**Answer: (A) Alendronate** 

Alendronate is a bisphosphonate that can be used for long-term management of hypercalcemia, particularly in cases related to malignancy.

Question: A 24-year-old previously healthy man comes to his physician because of dyspnea and hemoptysis for the past week. Examination shows inspiratory crackles at both lung bases. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. His hemoglobin concentration is 14.2 g/dL, leukocyte count is 10,300/mm3, and platelet count is 205,000/mm3. Urine dipstick shows 2+ proteins. Urinalysis shows 80 RBC/hpf and 1–2 WBC/hpf. An x-ray of the chest shows pulmonary infiltrates. Further evaluation is most likely to show increased serum titers of which of the following? (B) Anti-GBM antibody (A) Immunoglobulin A (C) Anti-dsDNA antibody (D) Anti-PLA2R antibody (E) P-ANCA
Reason: The patient in this scenario presents with signs suggestive of pulmonary hemorrhage (dyspnea, hemoptysis, and pulmonary infiltrates) alongside renal involvement (hematuria and proteinuria). These findings are characteristic of Goodpasture syndrome, which is associated with the presence of anti-GBM antibodies. The elevated titers of these antibodies can lead to both lung and kidney damage, making their detection a fundamental part of the diagnostic process in such cases.
Answer: (B) Anti-GBM antibody

Question: A 5-week-old infant boy presents to the pediatrician with intermittent vomiting for the last 2 weeks. The mother reports that the vomiting is non-bilious and immediately follows feeding. After vomiting, the baby is hungry and wants to feed again. The frequency of vomiting has been increasing progressively over 2 weeks. The vital signs are within normal limits. The examination of the abdomen reveals the presence of a firm mass of approx. 2 cm in length, above and to the right of the umbilicus. The mass is movable, olive-shaped, and hard on palpation. Which of the following is the most likely surgical treatment for this infant’s condition? (C) Duodenoduodenostomy (D) Diverticulectomy (B) Pyloromyotomy (A) Surgical ligation of the fistula and primary end-to-end anastomosis of the esophagus (E) Endorectal pull-through procedure
Reason: The clinical presentation of this 5-week-old infant, including the non-bilious vomiting immediately after feeding, increased frequency of vomiting, and the characteristic "olive-shaped" mass in the abdomen, suggests hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. The most effective surgical treatment for this condition is a pyloromyotomy, which involves the surgical division of the thickened pyloric muscle to alleviate the gastric outlet obstruction.
Answer: (B) Pyloromyotomy

Question: A 21-year-old man undergoes orthopedic surgery for a leg fracture that he has sustained in a motorbike accident. After induction of anesthesia with desflurane, the patient's respiratory minute ventilation decreases notably. Which of the following additional effects is most likely to occur in response to this drug? (D) Increased intracranial pressure (B) Increased cerebral metabolic rate (A) Increased glomerular filtration rate (C) Decreased seizure threshold (E) Increased skeletal muscle tonus
Reason: Desflurane is a volatile anesthetic known to have several physiological effects when used in anesthesia. Given its potential to cause cerebral vasodilation, one might expect that it could increase intracranial pressure, especially if the minute ventilation decreases, which can lead to increased carbon dioxide levels in the blood (hypercapnia). This, in turn, can cause further vasodilation and contribute to elevated intracranial pressure.
Answer: (D) Increased intracranial pressure

Question: A 54-year-old man presents to the emergency department after vomiting blood an hour ago. He says this happens to him occasionally but denies feeling pain in these episodes. The man is disheveled and has slurred speech as he describes his symptoms. He is reluctant to give further history and wants immediate treatment of his condition. Upon examination, the patient has evidence of tortuous veins visible on his abdomen plus a yellow tinge to his sclerae. He suddenly begins vomiting copious amounts of blood and soon becomes unresponsive. His blood pressure drops to 70/40 mm Hg. He is given 3 units of whole blood but passes away shortly after the incident. Which of the following was the most likely cause of his vomiting of blood? (D) Decreased GABA activity due to downregulation of receptors (E) Inflammation of the portal tract due to a chronic viral illness (B) Lacerations of the mucosa at the gastroesophageal junction (A) Increased pressure in the distal esophageal vein due to increased pressure in the left gastric vein (C) Perforation of the gastric mucosa
Reason: The patient's presentation suggests he experienced esophageal variceal bleeding, likely due to portal hypertension caused by liver disease or cirrhosis, as indicated by the visible tortuous veins on his abdomen and the jaundice. The increased pressure in the left gastric vein leads to increased pressure in the distal esophageal veins, causing these veins to become engorged and ultimately resulting in variceal rupture, which would account for the profuse vomiting of blood and the rapid decline in his clinical status.
Answer: (A) Increased pressure in the distal esophageal vein due to increased pressure in the left gastric vein

Question: A 19-year-old man and recent immigrant from Brazil present to the clinic. He has no known past medical, past surgical, or family history. The patient admits to having several regular sexual partners. Today, he complains of a skin rash on his back. He is unclear when it started but became aware when one of his partners pointed it out. A review of systems is otherwise negative. Physical examination reveals numerous hypopigmented skin lesions over his upper back. When questioned, he states that they do not get darker after spending time in the sun. On examination, there is a 5 cm (1.9 in) patch of hypopigmented skin in the center of his back with a fine-scale overlying it. What is the most likely diagnosis? (A) Tinea versicolor (E) Secondary syphilis (B) Mycosis fungoides (D) Vitiligo (C) Pityriasis rosea
Reason: The clinical presentation of numerous hypopigmented skin lesions with a fine scale that do not darken upon sun exposure is characteristic of tinea versicolor, which is caused by a fungal infection of the skin. The fact that the patient is a recent immigrant from Brazil and has multiple sexual partners may also suggest he has been exposed to various infectious agents, but the distinct appearance of the lesions and their behavior in sunlight strongly supports the diagnosis of tinea versicolor.
Answer: (A) Tinea versicolor

Question: A 16-year-old girl with celiac disease is brought to the physician because of a 1-week history of generalized weakness and tingling around her mouth and in her fingertips. She also complains of abdominal cramps and nausea. In addition to following a gluten-free diet, she has been following a vegan diet for the past 2 years. Physical examination shows involuntary contractions of the muscle at the corner of her mouth and nose that are elicited by tapping on her right cheek. Her parathyroid hormone concentration is 834 pg/mL. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause for this patient's current condition? (A) Decreased conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to cholecalciferol (B) Decreased levels of renal 1α-hydroxylase (E) Autoimmune-mediated destruction of parathyroid tissue (D) Decreased intestinal absorption of ergocalciferol (C) Decreased dietary intake of ergocalciferol
Reason: The patient's history of celiac disease suggests that her intestine's ability to absorb nutrients, including vitamins, is compromised. Given her vegan diet, which excludes animal products, including vitamin D sources, her malabsorption due to celiac disease likely leads to a deficiency in vitamin D (ergocalciferol), which is not being adequately absorbed in the intestines, contributing to her symptoms of weakness, tingling, and increased parathyroid hormone levels indicative of secondary hyperparathyroidism.
Answer: (D) Decreased intestinal absorption of ergocalciferol

Question: A 35-year-old man presents with erectile dysfunction. Past medical history is significant for diabetes mellitus type 1 diagnosed 25 years ago, managed with insulin, and for donating blood 6 months ago. The patient denies any history of smoking or alcohol use. He is afebrile, and his vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows a bronze-colored hyperpigmentation on the dorsal side of the arms bilaterally. Nocturnal penile tumescence is negative. Routine basic laboratory tests are significant for a moderate increase in glycosylated hemoglobin and hepatic enzymes. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient? (A) Hemochromatosis (C) Wilson's disease (E) Chronic hepatitis (B) Psychogenic erectile dysfunction (D) Porphyria cutanea tarda
Reason: The presence of bronze-colored hyperpigmentation on the skin, coupled with the patient's long-standing type 1 diabetes and abnormal liver enzymes, strongly suggests hemochromatosis, a condition characterized by excessive iron accumulation in the body. This excess iron can lead to symptoms affecting multiple organs, including the liver and endocrine systems, contributing to erectile dysfunction in this patient as well.

Let's analyze the situation step by step.

The infant is one week old and presents with jaundice (yellowing of the skin), which is common in newborns. The mother reports that the infant is breastfeeding well and has a good feeding pattern. 

In newborns, jaundice can be classified into two main types: physiological and pathological. Physiological jaundice typically appears after the first 24 hours of life and resolves within the first week or two. It is usually due to the immature liver's inability to process bilirubin effectively. 

Given that this infant is exclusively breastfed and is otherwise healthy, the jaundice is likely physiological. In cases of physiological jaundice, the best management is often to continue normal breastfeeding, as breastfeeding can help promote bilirubin elimination through stool.

Now, let's evaluate the options:
- (E) Continue normal breast feeding: This is appropriate for physiological jaundice.
- (C) Plasma exchange: This is typically reserved for severe cases of hemolytic disease of the newborn, not for physiological jaundice.
- (D) Switch from breast milk to formula: This is not necessary unless there is a concern for breastfeeding failure or significant dehydration.
- (A) Phototherapy: This is used for more severe jaundice, particularly if bilirubin levels are high enough to pose a risk of kernicterus.
- (B) Phenobarbital administration: This is not a standard treatment for jaundice in newborns.

Given the information provided, the best treatment for this infant's condition is to continue normal breastfeeding.

Answer: (E) Continue normal breast feeding.

Question: A 72-year-old man with type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and systolic heart failure comes to the physician because of a 5-day history of progressively worsening shortness of breath at rest. Physical examination shows jugular venous distention, diffuse crackles over the lower lung fields, and bilateral lower extremity edema. As a part of treatment, he is given a derivative of a hormone that acts by altering guanylate cyclase activity. This drug has been found to reduce pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and causes systemic hypotension as an adverse effect. The drug is most likely a derivative of which of the following hormones? (A) Angiotensin II (D) Prostacyclin (B) Aldosterone (C) Brain natriuretic peptide (E) Somatostatin
Reason: The correct answer is (C) Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP). This hormone is produced by the heart in response to increased wall stress and works by activating guanylate cyclase, which leads to vasodilation and reduced preload on the heart, effectively alleviating symptoms of heart failure. The adverse effect of systemic hypotension and the impact on pulmonary capillary wedge pressure support the identification of BNP as the hormone derivative used in this patient’s treatment.
Answer: (C) Brain natriuretic peptide

Question: A 5-year-old child presents with lower-extremity edema for the past 4 days. Three weeks ago, he experienced several days of cough and fever that was treated with acetaminophen. His medical history is unremarkable; he was born after an uneventful term pregnancy. His vaccinations are up to date. At presentation, his blood pressure is 81/42 mm Hg, and heart rate is 111/min. The child is playful and in no acute distress. Physical examination is remarkable only for ocular 'puffiness' and lower-extremity edema. Chest auscultation is clear, and there are no abnormalities during abdominal inspection. A urinalysis shows the presence of proteinuria, but there is no hematuria. What is the most appropriate treatment for this patient? (C) Plasmapheresis (D) Intravenous cyclophosphamide (A) Oral prednisone (E) No treatment is required (B) Oral azathioprine
Reason: The correct answer is (A) Oral prednisone. This child likely has minimal change disease, a common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children characterized by heavy proteinuria and edema. Oral prednisone is the first-line treatment for this condition, as it helps reduce inflammation and manage symptoms effectively.

She claims she has had these lesions for 3 or 4 years. The lesions are painless, not pruritic, and have never bled. However, she is moderately distressed about the potential malignancy of these lesions after she heard that a close friend was just diagnosed with a melanoma. The medical history is unremarkable. Physical examination reveals a few well-demarcated, round, verrucous lesions, with a stuck-on appearance, distributed on the patient’s back and face (see image). Under a dermatoscope, the lesions showed multiple comodo-openings, milia cysts, and a cerebriform pattern. What is the best next step of management? (D) Shave excision (E) Topical fluorouracil (A) Excisional biopsy (C) Cryotherapy (B) Reassure the patient and provide general recommendations
Reason: The correct answer is (B) Reassure the patient and provide general recommendations. The lesions described are likely seborrheic keratoses, which are benign and common in older adults. Given their characteristic features and long-standing presence without change, these lesions do not require invasive treatment, and reassuring the patient can help alleviate her concerns about malignancy.

Question: A 57-year-old man is brought to the emergency department for crushing substernal chest pain at rest for the past 2 hours. The pain began gradually while he was having an argument with his wife and is now severe. He does not take any medications. He has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for 35 years. He is diaphoretic. His temperature is 37.1°C (98.8°F), pulse is 110/min, respirations are 21/min, and blood pressure is 115/65 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 97%. Cardiac examination shows an S4 gallop. The lungs are clear to auscultation. An ECG is shown. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition? (C) Diffuse coronary vasospasm (B) Thromboembolism to the right interlobar pulmonary artery (A) Occlusion of the left anterior descending artery (D) Occlusion of the left circumflex artery (E) Tear in the intimal lining of the aorta
Reason: The correct answer is (A) Occlusion of the left anterior descending artery (LAD). The patient's presentation of severe crushing chest pain, diaphoresis, S4 gallop, and history of significant risk factors such as smoking suggest acute coronary syndrome, likely related to myocardial ischemia due to an obstruction in the coronary arteries. The left anterior descending artery supplies a large portion of the heart muscle, and its occlusion is commonly associated with ischemic heart disease and acute myocardial infarctions, particularly in patients with risk factors like this man.

Let's analyze the information step by step.

The patient presents with several key symptoms and laboratory findings:

1. **Symptoms**: 
   - Headache, palpitations, and diaphoresis suggest catecholamine excess, which is often seen in pheochromocytoma.
   - Diffuse thyroid swelling (thyromegaly) indicates a thyroid issue, possibly hyperthyroidism.
   - Pain in long bones and anxiety could be related to hypercalcemia or other metabolic disturbances.

2. **Vital Signs**: 
   - The patient has hypertension (196/102 mm Hg) and tachycardia (pulse of 116/min), which can be associated with pheochromocytoma or hyperthyroidism.

3. **Laboratory Findings**: 
   - Elevated 24-hour urinary VMA and metanephrines indicate catecholamine-secreting tumors, such as pheochromocytoma.
   - Elevated serum epinephrine suggests adrenal involvement.
   - Elevated calcitonin indicates possible medullary thyroid carcinoma.
   - Hypercalcemia and hyperglycemia can be associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes.

4. **Diagnosis Consideration**:
   - The combination of pheochromocytoma (elevated catecholamines), medullary thyroid carcinoma (elevated calcitonin), and possibly primary hyperparathyroidism (elevated parathormone and hypercalcemia) points towards Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia (MEN) syndrome.
   - MEN 2B specifically includes pheochromocytoma, medullary thyroid carcinoma, and mucosal neuromas, and it is associated with a marfanoid habitus, which could explain the patient's thin build.

Given these considerations, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is:

Which of the following antibodies would you expect to find in this patient? (B) Anti-endomysial IgA (D) Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) (E) Anti-double stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) (A) Anti-mitochondrial antibody (C) Perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (p-ANCA)
Reason: The clinical presentation of jaundice, bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, hepatomegaly, and elevated liver enzymes suggests a possible inflammatory bowel disease, such as ulcerative colitis, which can be associated with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and liver involvement. The presence of perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (p-ANCA) is a common serological finding in patients with ulcerative colitis, making it a likely expected antibody in this patient.
Answer: (C) Perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (p-ANCA)

Question: A 70-year-old man presents to the emergency department with severe substernal chest pain of one hour’s duration. The patient was taking a morning walk when the onset of pain led him to seek care. His past medical history includes coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension. Medications include aspirin, losartan, and atorvastatin. An electrocardiogram reveals ST elevations in the inferior leads II, III, and avF as well as in leads V5 and V6. The ST elevations found in leads V5-V6 are most indicative of pathology in which of the following areas of the heart? (D) Left atrium, left main coronary artery (B) Interventricular septum, left anterior descending coronary artery (C) Lateral wall of left ventricle, left circumflex coronary artery (E) Right ventricle, left main coronary artery (A) Inferior wall, right coronary artery
Reason: The ST elevations observed in the inferior leads (II, III, aVF) suggest inferior wall ischemia, typically associated with occlusion of the right coronary artery (RCA) in a right-dominant coronary system. However, the presence of ST elevations in leads V5 and V6 indicates that the lateral wall of the left ventricle is also involved, which is typically supplied by the left circumflex coronary artery. Thus, option (C) correctly identifies the lateral wall of the left ventricle as the area impacted by the pathology in this patient's case.
Answer: (C) Lateral wall of left ventricle, left circumflex coronary artery

Let's analyze the information step by step.

1. **Study Design**: The study compares young patients with myocardial infarction (MI) to healthy controls, focusing on educational status as a potential risk factor.

2. **Odds Ratio**: An odds ratio (OR) of 2.1 suggests that individuals with low educational status are more than twice as likely to experience MI compared to those with high educational status.

3. **Confidence Interval**: The confidence interval (CI) of 0.9–9.7 includes 1. This indicates that the association is not statistically significant because a CI that includes 1 means that we cannot rule out the possibility that there is no effect (i.e., no association).

4. **Statistical Significance**: Since the CI includes 1, we conclude that the association between low education and the risk of MI is not statistically significant.

5. **Risk Factor Conclusion**: Although the odds ratio suggests a potential association, the lack of statistical significance means we cannot definitively say that low education is a risk factor based on this study.

Based on this analysis, the most appropriate inference is:

**Answer: (A) The association is not statistically significant, and low education is not a risk factor.**

Question: A 55-year-old man presents to his primary care physician for a wellness checkup. He states that he generally feels well and has no complaints at this time. The patient consumes alcohol frequently, eats a high sodium diet, and is sedentary. His temperature is 97.5°F (36.4°C), blood pressure is 167/108 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. The patient’s blood pressure at his last 2 appointments were 159/100 mmHg and 162/99 mmHg, respectively. His physician wants to intervene to manage his blood pressure. Which of the following is the most effective treatment for this patient’s hypertension? (B) Exercise (D) Sodium restriction (A) DASH diet (E) Weight loss (C) Reduce alcohol consumption
Reason: Weight loss is often cited as one of the most effective interventions for managing hypertension, particularly in individuals who are overweight or sedentary. In this scenario, the patient exhibits several risk factors for hypertension, including a high-sodium diet, sedentary lifestyle, and frequent alcohol consumption; thus, reducing weight could significantly impact his blood pressure levels.
Answer: (E) Weight loss

Question: A 23-year-old woman presents to a medical office for a check-up. The patient has a 5-year history of epilepsy with focal-onset motor seizures and currently is seizure-free on 50 mg of lamotrigine 3 times a day. She does not have any concurrent illnesses and does not take other medications, except oral contraceptive pills. She is considering pregnancy and seeks advice on possible adjustments or additions to her therapy. Which of the following changes should be made? (D) Change lamotrigine to oxcarbazepine prior to conception (C) Recommend 100 μg of vitamin K daily with no changes to antiepileptic therapy (B) Recommend 5 mg of folic acid daily with no changes to antiepileptic therapy (E) No changes or additions to the patient’s regimen are indicated (A) Decrease the dose of lamotrigine to 50 mg 2 times a day
Reason: Recommending 5 mg of folic acid daily is essential for women considering pregnancy, especially those on antiepileptic medications, as it helps reduce the risk of neural tube defects in the developing fetus. While the patient's lamotrigine dose may not need to change, adequate folic acid supplementation is crucial to support a healthy pregnancy outcome.
Answer: (B) Recommend 5 mg of folic acid daily with no changes to antiepileptic therapy

Question: A 13-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department because of a 2-day history of fever, headache, and irritability. He shares a room with his 7-year-old brother, who does not have any symptoms. The patient appears weak and lethargic. His temperature is 39.1°C (102.4°F) and blood pressure is 99/60 mm Hg. Physical examination shows several purple spots over the trunk and extremities. A lumbar puncture is performed. Gram stain of the cerebrospinal fluid shows numerous gram-negative diplococci. Administration of which of the following is most likely to prevent infection of the patient's brother at this time? (E) Doxycycline (A) Penicillin G (C) Conjugated vaccine (D) Rifampin (B) Cephalexin
Reason: Rifampin is the appropriate choice for prophylaxis against meningococcal infection in close contacts of a patient with meningococcal disease, as it effectively eliminates the bacteria from the nasopharynx and helps prevent the spread of infection. Given the presence of gram-negative diplococci in the cerebrospinal fluid, which is indicative of Neisseria meningitidis, initiating prophylactic treatment with rifampin for the patient's brother is critical to reduce the risk of him developing meningococcal disease.
Answer: (D) Rifampin

Question: A 24-year-old man presents to the emergency room with a stab wound to the left chest at the sternocostal junction at the 4th intercostal space. The patient is hemodynamically unstable, and the trauma attending is concerned that there is penetrating trauma to the heart as. Which cardiovascular structure is most likely to be injured first in this stab wound? (A) Left atrium (C) Right atrium (D) Right ventricle (E) Aorta (B) Left ventricle
Reason: The right ventricle is the most likely cardiovascular structure to be injured first in a stab wound to the left chest at the sternocostal junction because it lies anteriorly and is located close to the chest wall. Due to its position, any penetrating injury to this region is more likely to damage the right ventricle before affecting deeper structures, such as the left ventricle or the aorta.
Answer: (D) Right ventricle

Question: A previously healthy 26-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 30 minutes after collapsing during soccer practice. The patient appears well. His pulse is 73/min and blood pressure is 125/78 mm Hg. Cardiac examination is shown. Rapid squatting decreases the intensity of the patient's auscultation finding. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's condition? (B) Fibrinoid necrosis of the mitral valve (D) Calcification of the aortic valve (A) Asymmetric hypertrophy of the septum (E) Dilation of the aortic root (C) Eccentric dilatation of the left ventricle
Reason: Asymmetric hypertrophy of the septum is characteristic of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which can lead to dynamic obstruction of the left ventricular outflow tract, causing symptoms such as syncope during exertion. The fact that rapid squatting decreases the intensity of the auscultation finding suggests that increased venous return temporarily mitigates the outflow obstruction, supporting the diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy due to septal hypertrophy.
Answer: (A) Asymmetric hypertrophy of the septum

Question: A 60-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of recurrent episodes of fatigue, palpitations, nausea, and diaphoresis over the past 6 months. The episodes have become more frequent in the last 2 weeks and he has missed work several times because of them. His symptoms usually improve after he drinks some juice and rests. He has had a 2-kg (4.5-lb) weight gain in the past 6 months. He has a history of bipolar disorder, hypertension, and asthma. His sister has type 2 diabetes mellitus and his mother has a history of medullary thyroid carcinoma. His medications include lithium, hydrochlorothiazide, aspirin, and a budesonide inhaler. His temperature is 36.3°C (97.3°F), pulse is 92/min and regular, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 118/65 mm Hg. Abdominal examination shows no abnormalities. Serum studies show:
Na+ 145 mEq/L
K+ 3.9 mEq/L
Cl- 103 mEq/L
Calcium 9.2 mg/dL
Glucose 88 mg/dL
Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?" (B) 24-hour urine catecholamine test (C) 72-hour fasting test (A) Oral glucose tolerance test (D) Water deprivation test (E) Corticotropin stimulation test
Reason: The recurrent episodes of fatigue, palpitations, nausea, and diaphoresis that improve with juice consumption suggest episodes of hypoglycemia, which could be due to an insulinoma or another form of hypoglycemia-related disorder. A 72-hour fasting test is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis because it allows for the observation of blood glucose levels and the assessment of endogenous insulin production to determine the presence of an insulinoma or other causes of reactive hypoglycemia.
Answer: (C) 72-hour fasting test

Question: A 72-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of a 2-week history of worsening shortness of breath, lower extremity swelling, and a 3-kg (6.6-lb) weight gain. Crackles are heard on auscultation of the chest. Cardiac examination shows a dull, low-pitched early diastolic sound at the 5th left intercostal space that becomes louder in the left lateral decubitus position at end-expiration. Which of the following is the most likely cause of these auscultation findings? (D) Decreased left-ventricular filling pressure (A) Decreased left myocardial compliance (B) Increased ventricular contractility (E) Increased capacity of the pulmonary circulation (C) Increased left ventricular end-systolic volume
Reason: The presence of a dull, low-pitched early diastolic sound (likely a third heart sound, or S3) that becomes louder in the left lateral decubitus position is indicative of increased left ventricular end-systolic volume, which can occur due to heart failure or volume overload. This sound reflects the sudden deceleration of blood flow into a distended left ventricle, suggesting that the heart's ability to accommodate blood is compromised, resulting in increased end-systolic volume and a clinical presentation consistent with congestive heart failure.
Answer: (C) Increased left ventricular end-systolic volume

Question: A 55-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a headache, blurry vision, and abdominal pain. He states that his symptoms started several hours ago and have been gradually worsening. His temperature is 99.3°F (37.4°C), blood pressure is 222/128 mmHg, pulse is 87/min, respirations are 16/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Physical exam is notable for an uncomfortable and distressed man. The patient is started on an esmolol and a nitroprusside drip thus lowering his blood pressure to 200/118 mmHg. The patient states that he feels better, but complains of feeling warm and flushed. An hour later, the patient seems confused and states his headache has resurfaced. Laboratory values are ordered as seen below.

Serum:
Na+: 138 mEq/L
Cl-: 101 mEq/L
K+: 4.4 mEq/L
HCO3-: 17 mEq/L
BUN: 31 mg/dL
Glucose: 199 mg/dL
Creatinine: 1.4 mg/dL
Ca2+: 10.2 mg/dL

Which of the following is the best treatment for this patient? (E) Labetalol (B) Hydroxocobalamin (C) Insulin (A) Amyl nitrite (D) IV fluids
Reason: The patient's presentation of confusion, headache, and elevated blood pressure, combined with the administration of nitroprusside, raises concerns for potential cyanide toxicity, which can occur due to the metabolism of nitroprusside. Hydroxocobalamin is the best treatment in this scenario as it acts as an antidote for cyanide toxicity by binding to cyanide ions to form non-toxic cyanocobalamin, allowing for safe excretion.
Answer: (B) Hydroxocobalamin

Let's analyze the scenario step by step.

1. **Patient Presentation**: The patient is a 26-year-old woman involved in a high-speed motor vehicle collision. She is lethargic, incoherent, in respiratory distress, and has severe facial lacerations. Her vital signs indicate tachycardia (pulse of 130/min), tachypnea (respirations of 29/min), and hypotension (blood pressure of 90/58 mm Hg). 

2. **Oxygen Saturation**: The oxygen saturation is critically low at 70%, indicating significant respiratory compromise.

3. **Physical Examination Findings**: 
   - Dullness to percussion and decreased breath sounds over the left lung base suggest fluid accumulation or a mass effect in the left thoracic cavity.
   - Abdominal examination shows diffuse tenderness but no guarding or rebound, which may indicate intra-abdominal injury but is not specific.

4. **Imaging Findings**: 
   - The chest x-ray shows a fractured left second rib, depression of the left mainstem bronchus, deviation of the nasogastric tube to the right, and a widened mediastinum. 
   - A widened mediastinum is particularly concerning for potential vascular injury, such as a thoracic aortic rupture.

5. **Differential Diagnosis**:
   - **Tension pneumothorax**: Would typically present with tracheal deviation away from the affected side and hyper-resonance on percussion, which is not indicated here.
   - **Thoracic aortic rupture**: The combination of a widened mediastinum, rib fracture, and the mechanism of injury (high-speed collision) strongly suggests this diagnosis.
   - **Traumatic bronchial rupture**: Would likely present with different findings, such as subcutaneous emphysema or significant respiratory distress without the mediastinal widening.
   - **Diaphragmatic rupture**: Would typically present with bowel sounds in the thorax or respiratory distress but is less likely given the mediastinal findings.
   - **Cardiac tamponade**: Would present with hypotension, muffled heart sounds, and jugular venous distension, but the mediastinal widening is more indicative of aortic injury.

Given the mechanism of injury, the imaging findings, and the clinical presentation, the most likely diagnosis is:

**Answer: (C) Thoracic aortic rupture**

Question: A 24-year-old man presents to the emergency department after a motor vehicle accident. The patient was at a stop when he was rear-ended from behind by a vehicle traveling at 11 miles per hour. The patient complains of severe back pain but states he otherwise feels well. The patient is currently seeing a physical therapist who is giving him exercises to alleviate the back pain that is present every morning, relived by activity, and worse with inactivity. He is a student at the university and is struggling with his grades. His temperature is 98.4°F (36.9°C), blood pressure is 117/78 mmHg, pulse is 116/min, respirations are 12/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Physical exam demonstrates a decreased range of motion of the patient's spine and tenderness to palpation over the vertebrae. The rest of the exam is deferred due to pain. The patient is requesting a note to excuse him from final exams and work. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient? (E) Vertebral fracture (C) Musculoskeletal strain (D) Spondylolisthesis (B) Malingering (A) Herniated nucleus pulposus
Reason: Reasoning: The presentation of severe back pain following a motor vehicle accident, along with physical examination findings of decreased range of motion and tenderness over the vertebrae, raises concern for a vertebral fracture. The mechanism of injury, coupled with the acute onset of symptoms, supports this diagnosis, making it the most likely initial evaluation finding.

Question: A 48-year-old woman is brought to her primary care physician by her sister who is concerned about a deterioration in the patient’s general status. The patient was diagnosed with HIV 7 years ago. She says that her last T cell count was "good enough", so she has been been skipping every other dose of her antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Her sister has had to drive her home from work several times this month because she has become disoriented and confused about her surroundings. Motor strength is 4/5 on the right and 3/5 on the left. She is able to walk unassisted, but her gait appears mildly uncoordinated. There is diplopia when the right eye is covered. Her CD4 count is 75 cells/µL. MRI shows numerous asymmetric, hyperintense, non-enhancing lesions bilaterally without mass effect. Brain biopsy shows demyelination and atypical astrocytes. Which of the following is most likely responsible for this patient's current condition? (E) Toxoplasma gondii (C) John Cunningham virus (JC virus) (A) Autoimmune demyelination (B) HIV associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) (D) Primary CNS lymphoma (PCNSL)
Reason: Reasoning: This patient's history of HIV with a severely low CD4 count (75 cells/µL) and MRI findings of numerous hyperintense lesions without mass effect are highly suggestive of Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML), a demyelinating disease caused by JC virus. The presence of demyelination and atypical astrocytes observed in the brain biopsy further supports this diagnosis, distinguishing it from other conditions such as toxoplasmosis or primary CNS lymphoma.
Answer: (C) John Cunningham virus (JC virus)

Question: A 55-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his friends after he was found vomiting copious amounts of blood. According to his friends, he is a chronic alcoholic and lost his family and job because of his drinking. The admission vital signs were as follows: blood pressure is 100/75 mm Hg, heart rate is 95/min, respiratory rate is 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 97% on room air. He is otherwise alert and oriented to time, place, and person. The patient was stabilized with intravenous fluids and a nasogastric tube was inserted. He is urgently prepared for endoscopic evaluation. An image from the procedure is shown. Which of the following sets of pathologies with the portacaval anastomoses is paired correctly? (D) External hemorrhoids | Caval (systemic): middle and inferior rectal veins | Portal (hepatic): superior rectal vein (B) Anorectal varices | Caval (systemic): inferior rectal vein | Portal (hepatic): middle rectal vein (A) Caput medusae | Caval (systemic): epigastric veins | Portal (hepatic): paraumbilical vein (C) Esophageal varices | Caval (systemic): azygos vein | Portal (hepatic): esophageal vein (E) Internal hemorrhoids | Caval (systemic): retroperitoneal veins | Portal (hepatic): colic veins
Reason: Reasoning: Caput medusae refers to the presence of distended and engorged superficial epigastric veins due to increased pressure in the portosystemic circulation, typically caused by portal hypertension. In this condition, the blood is redirected from the paraumbilical veins (which drain into the portal vein) to the epigastric veins (which drain into the systemic circulation), establishing the correct pairing of the systemic and portal venous systems in this pathology.
Answer: (A) Caput medusae | Caval (systemic): epigastric veins | Portal (hepatic): paraumbilical vein

Question: A 48-year-old woman is transferred from her primary care physician's office to the emergency department for further evaluation of hypokalemia to 2.5 mEq/L. She was recently diagnosed with hypertension 2 weeks ago and started on medical therapy. The patient said that she enjoys all kinds of food and exercises regularly, but has not been able to complete her workouts as she usually does. Her temperature is 97.7°F (36.5°C), blood pressure is 107/74 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, respirations are 15/min, and SpO2 is 94% on room air. Her physical exam is unremarkable. Peripheral intravenous (IV) access is obtained. Her basic metabolic panel is obtained below.

Serum:
Na+: 135 mEq/L
Cl-: 89 mEq/L
K+: 2.2 mEq/L
HCO3-: 33 mEq/L
BUN: 44 mg/dL
Glucose: 147 mg/dL
Creatinine: 2.3 mg/dL
Magnesium: 2.0 mEq/L

What is the next best step in management? (E) Obtain urine sodium and creatinine (D) Administer isotonic saline 1 liter via peripheral IV (A) Obtain an electrocardiogram (C) Administer potassium chloride 40mEq via peripheral IV (B) Administer potassium bicarbonate 50mEq per oral
Reason: Reasoning: In a patient presenting with severe hypokalemia (K+ of 2.2 mEq/L) and stable vital signs, it is crucial to ensure adequate hydration and maintain renal perfusion before addressing potassium supplementation. Administering isotonic saline helps to dilute the serum potassium, improves renal function, and may aid in correcting the underlying causes of hypokalemia, such as potential volume depletion or kidney function issues.

Question: A 23-year-old man complains of lower back pain that began approximately 6 months ago. He is unsure why he is experiencing this pain and notices that this pain is worse in the morning after waking up and improves with physical activity. Ibuprofen provides significant relief. He denies bowel and bladder incontinence or erectile dysfunction. Physical exam is notable for decreased chest expansion, decreased spinal range of motion, 5/5 strength in both lower extremities, 2+ patellar reflexes bilaterally, and an absence of saddle anesthesia. Which of the following is the most appropriate next test for this patient? (E) Slit-lamp examination (D) Radiograph sacroiliac joint (C) MRI sacroiliac joint (A) ESR (B) HLA-B27
Reason: Reasoning: The clinical presentation of this patient, including lower back pain that is worse in the morning and improves with activity, along with decreased spinal range of motion, is suggestive of ankylosing spondylitis, a type of inflammatory arthritis. A radiograph of the sacroiliac joint is the most appropriate initial test to evaluate for characteristic findings of sacroiliitis, which can help confirm the diagnosis and guide further management.

Question: A 68-year-old man presents to the office for his annual physical examination. He has no current complaints. Past medical history is unremarkable. He reports a 30-pack-year smoking history but no alcohol or drug use. Review of systems is only remarkable for thicker mucous production that is worse in the morning when he coughs. A non-contrast CT scan of his chest is performed, and the doctor informs him that a 2 cm nodule has been identified in his upper lobe of the left lung near the left main bronchus and that further testing is required to rule out malignancy. The patient is surprised by this news since he has never experienced any alarming symptoms. The doctor informs him that lung cancers don’t usually present with symptoms until late in the course of the disease. The doctor says that sometimes it may take several years before it becomes severe enough to cause symptoms, which is why patients with risk factors for developing lung cancer are screened at an earlier age than the general public. Which of the following concepts is being described by the doctor to this patient? (B) Confounding bias (E) Lead time bias (D) Latent period (A) Surveillance bias (C) Induction period
Reason: Reasoning: The physician's explanation to the patient highlights that lung cancers may develop and become detectable through screening before they cause any noticeable symptoms, which is characteristic of a latent period. This concept refers to the time during which a disease is present but not yet symptomatic, emphasizing the importance of early detection in individuals at risk, such as this patient with a significant smoking history.

Question: A 3-month-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his mom for breathing difficulty after a recent fall. His parents say that he rolled off of the mattress and landed on the hard wood floor earlier today. After an extensive physical exam, he is found to have many purplish bruises and retinal hemorrhages. A non-contrast head CT scan shows a subdural hemorrhage. He was treated in the hospital with full recovery from his symptoms. Which of the following is the most important follow up plan? (C) Provide home nursing visits (B) Provide parents with anticipatory guidance (D) Reassurance that accidents are common (A) Inform child protective services (E) Referral to genetics for further testing
Reason: Reasoning: The presentation of this 3-month-old boy with bruising, retinal hemorrhages, and a subdural hemorrhage raises significant concern for potential non-accidental trauma, such as child abuse. The presence of these findings, especially in a child who has sustained what appears to be a relatively minor fall, necessitates reporting to child protective services to ensure the child's safety and to investigate any possible abuse or neglect.

Question: A 49-year-old woman comes to the physician because of difficulty walking and dizziness for the past 2 weeks. She has also had fatigue, heartburn, and diarrhea for 4 months. The stools are foul-smelling and do not flush easily. Over the past 4 months, she has had a 2.2-kg (5-lb) weight loss. Her only medication is an over-the-counter antacid. Her mother has autoimmune thyroid disease and Crohn disease. She is 150 cm (4 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 43 kg (95 lb); BMI is 19.1 kg/m2. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows a wide-based gait. Muscle strength and tone are normal in all extremities. Rapid alternating movement of the hands is impaired. The abdomen is soft and there is mild tenderness to palpation in the epigastric area. Her hemoglobin concentration is 11.1 mg/dL, and levels of vitamin E and vitamin D are decreased. Upper endoscopy shows several ulcers in the gastric antrum and the descending duodenum. Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's symptoms? (A) Autoantibodies against the intestinal mucosa (E) Small intestine bacterial overgrowth (B) Inactivation of pancreatic enzymes (C) T. whipplei infiltration of intestinal villi (D) Intestinal inflammatory reaction to gluten
Reason: Reasoning: This patient's symptoms, including foul-smelling diarrhea, weight loss, and nausea, combined with the findings of steatorrhea (indicated by the characteristics of the stools), suggest a malabsorption syndrome likely due to insufficient pancreatic enzyme activity. The presence of gastric ulcers and the patient's gastrointestinal complaints strengthen the possibility of pancreatic insufficiency, which can result from various conditions; thus, inactivation of pancreatic enzymes is a plausible underlying mechanism for her symptoms.
Answer: (B) Inactivation of pancreatic enzymes

Let's analyze the situation step by step.

1. **Patient Background**: The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of myocardial infarction, which suggests he may have underlying heart failure or reduced cardiac output.

2. **Symptoms**: He presents with dyspnea on exertion and swollen feet and ankles, which are common signs of fluid retention and heart failure.

3. **Physical Exam Findings**: The elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP) indicates increased central venous pressure, which is often seen in heart failure. The presence of 2+ pitting edema in the lower extremities suggests fluid accumulation in the interstitial spaces.

4. **Mechanism of Edema**: In heart failure, the heart's inability to pump effectively leads to increased pressure in the venous system. This increased pressure in the capillaries (capillary hydrostatic pressure) causes fluid to leak out into the interstitial space, resulting in edema.

5. **Options Analysis**:
   - (D) Increase in colloid osmotic pressure: This would typically decrease edema, not cause it.
   - (C) Increase in capillary permeability: This can cause edema but is not the primary mechanism in heart failure.
   - (E) Increase in interstitial fluid pressure: This is a consequence of edema but not the primary cause.
   - (A) Increase in capillary pressure: This is consistent with heart failure and explains the edema.
   - (B) Decrease in plasma proteins: This can cause edema but is not indicated in this patient.

Based on this analysis, the most likely explanation for this patient's lower extremity edema is:

**Answer: (A) Increase in capillary pressure**

Question: A 10-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department due to vomiting and weakness. He is attending a summer camp and was on a hike with the other kids and a camp counselor. His friends say that the boy skipped breakfast, and the counselor says he forgot to pack snacks for the kids during the hike. The child’s parents are contacted and report that the child has been completely healthy since birth. They also say there is an uncle who would have to eat regularly or he would have similar symptoms. At the hospital, his heart rate is 90/min, respiratory rate is 17/min, blood pressure is 110/65 mm Hg, and temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F). Physical examination reveals a visibly lethargic child with slight disorientation to time and place. Mild hepatosplenomegaly is observed but no signs of dehydration are noted. A blood sample is drawn, and fluids are started via an intravenous line.

Question: A 40-year-old male presents to the clinic. The patient has begun taking large doses of vitamin E in order to slow down the aging process and increase his sexual output. He has placed himself on this regimen following reading a website that encouraged this, without consulting a healthcare professional. He is interested in knowing if it is alright to continue his supplementation. Which of the following side-effects should he be concerned about should he continue his regimen? (B) Deep venous thrombosis (D) Hemorrhage (C) Peripheral neuropathy (E) Retinopathy (A) Night blindness
Reason: The concern for hemorrhage arises from the fact that high doses of vitamin E can interfere with the blood clotting process by inhibiting platelet aggregation and affecting the normal function of vitamin K. Thus, excessive supplementation can increase the risk of bleeding disorders, especially in individuals who may also be taking anticoagulants or have underlying clotting issues.
Answer: (D) Hemorrhage

Question: A 33-year-old man presents to his physician with a 3-year history of gradually worsening tics and difficulty walking. He was last seen by the physician 5 years ago for anxiety, and he has been buying anti-anxiety medications from an internet website without a prescription as he cannot afford to pay for doctor’s visits. Now, the patient notes that his anxiety is somewhat controlled, but motor difficulties are making it difficult for him to work and socialize. Family history is unobtainable as his parents died in an accident when he was an infant. He grew up in foster care and was always a bright child. An MRI of the brain is ordered; it shows prominent atrophy of the caudate nucleus. Repeats of which of the following trinucleotides are most likely responsible for this patient’s disorder? (B) CGG (D) CAG (C) GAA (A) CCG (E) CTG
Reason: The symptoms presented in this case, including tics, difficulty walking, and prominent atrophy of the caudate nucleus, suggest a neurodegenerative disorder such as Huntington's disease, which is associated with CAG trinucleotide repeat expansions. This condition is characterized by motor and cognitive decline due to the degeneration of specific brain regions, particularly the basal ganglia, including the caudate nucleus, leading to the motor dysfunction observed in the patient.

Let's analyze the case step by step. 

The patient is a 32-year-old woman presenting with a history of amenorrhea (last menstrual period 4 months ago), a grape-like mass protruding from the vagina, and a significantly enlarged uterus. The absence of fetal heart sounds and the ultrasound findings indicating no fetal parts suggest a diagnosis of a molar pregnancy, specifically a complete hydatidiform mole.

In a complete hydatidiform mole, the typical genotype is 46XX, which arises from the fertilization of an empty ovum by a sperm that duplicates its genetic material, leading to a diploid set of chromosomes that is entirely paternal in origin. 

Given this information, the most appropriate answer regarding the genotype of the substance that will be aspirated by dilation and evacuation is:

Question: While performing a Western blot, a graduate student spilled a small amount of the radiolabeled antibody on her left forearm. Although very little harm was done to the skin, the radiation did cause minor damage to the DNA of the exposed skin by severing covalent bonds between the nitrogenous bases and the core ribose leaving several apurinic/apyrimidinic sites. Damaged cells would most likely repair these sites by which of the following mechanisms? (E) Homologous recombination (A) Nucleotide excision repair (B) Base excision repair (D) Nonhomologous end joining repair (C) Mismatch repair
Reason: Base excision repair is the correct answer because it specifically addresses small-scale DNA damage, such as the creation of apurinic/apyrimidinic sites caused by radiation. This mechanism involves the removal of damaged or non-canonical bases and subsequent replacement, effectively restoring the integrity of the DNA at the site of the damage.

Question: A 22-year-old man presents with multiple, target-like skin lesions on his right and left upper and lower limbs. He says that the lesions appeared 4 days ago and that, over the last 24 hours, they have extended to his torso. Past medical history is significant for pruritus and pain on the left border of his lower lip 1 week ago, followed by the development of an oral ulcerative lesion. On physical examination, multiple round erythematous papules with a central blister, a pale ring of edema surrounding a dark red inflammatory zone, and an erythematous halo are noted. Mucosal surfaces are free of any ulcerative and exudative lesions. Which of the following statements best explains the pathogenesis underlying this patient’s condition? (D) IgA deposition in the papillary dermis (E) Interferon (IFN) gamma production by CD4+ T cells in the skin (A) Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha production by CD4+ T cells in the skin (C) Circulating anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies (B) Circulating anti-desmoglein antibodies
Reason: The correct choice is (E) Interferon (IFN) gamma production by CD4+ T cells in the skin, as this aligns with the pathogenesis of erythema multiforme, which typically involves a hypersensitivity reaction often triggered by infections, such as herpes simplex virus, leading to the activation of CD4+ T cells. The target lesions described in the patient’s presentation are consistent with this condition, which is associated with immune responses in the skin.

Then, 3 days ago, he noted small painful red bumps on his hands and feet, which quickly worsened and spread to involve his extremities and upper torso. At the same time, multiple painful oral ulcers appeared, which have not improved. He denies any trouble breathing, pruritus, hemoptysis, hematochezia, or similar symptoms in the past. Past medical history is significant for a recent methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) skin infection 2 weeks ago secondary to a laceration on his left leg for which he has been taking trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. No other current medications. The patient is afebrile, and his vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination reveals multiple raised, erythematous, circular papules averaging 1–2 cm in diameter with a central bulla, as shown in the exhibit (see image below). The cutaneous lesions occupy < 10% of his total body surface area (BSA). Nicolsky sign is negative. Multiple mucosal erosions are noted in the oral cavity. Generalized lymphadenopathy is present. A well-healing laceration is present on the left leg with no evidence of drainage or fluctuance. A cutaneous punch biopsy of one of the lesions is performed. Which of the following histopathologic features would most likely be found on this patient’s biopsy? (C) Presence of intradermal blister and separation of suprabasal epidermal cells from basal cells (D) Presence of a subepidermal blister and a polymorphous inflammatory infiltrate with an eosinophilic predominance (B) Rich dermal inflammatory infiltrate, predominantly composed of CD4+ T cells (E) Mucin deposition in the dermal layer (A) Scant dermal inflammatory infiltrate, predominantly composed of macrophages and dendritic cells
Reason: The clinical presentation of painful oral ulcers, rash with raised erythematous papules, generalized lymphadenopathy, and a recent history of a MRSA skin infection suggests a post-infectious autoimmune or inflammatory response, possibly akin to conditions like drug eruptions or viral exanthems. The presence of a rich dermal inflammatory infiltrate, particularly with CD4+ T cells, supports the diagnosis of a T-cell mediated process, which aligns with the severe cutaneous manifestations and systemic symptoms observed in this patient.

Question: A 68-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of difficulty swallowing pieces of meat and choking frequently during meal times. He also sometimes regurgitates foul-smelling, undigested food particles. Examination shows a 3 x 3 cm soft cystic, immobile mass in the upper third of the left side of his neck anterior to the left sternocleidomastoid muscle that becomes prominent when he coughs. A barium swallow shows an accumulation of contrast on the lateral aspect of the neck at the C5 level. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause for this patient's condition? (B) Remnant of the embryological omphalomesenteric duct (A) Inadequate relaxation of lower esophageal sphincter (D) Remnant of the thyroglossal duct (C) Increased intrapharyngeal pressure (E) Remnant of the second branchial cleft
Reason: The patient’s symptoms of dysphagia, regurgitation of undigested food, and the presence of a cystic neck mass that becomes more prominent with coughing suggest the presence of a diverticulum in the esophagus, specifically a Zenker diverticulum. Increased intrapharyngeal pressure during swallowing can lead to the formation of a diverticulum as pressure builds up and outpouches through the weakened area of the pharyngeal wall, which fits the clinical picture seen in this patient.

Question: A 34-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department following a motor vehicle accident. She was walking on the sidewalk when a car traveling at high speed knocked her off her feet. She did not sustain any obvious injury but has painful breathing. An X-ray of the chest is taken to exclude a rib fracture and contusion of the lungs. The X-ray is found to be normal except for a solitary calcified nodule located in the left hilar region. The physician then asks the patient if she is or was a smoker, or has any pertinent medical history to explain the nodule. Her past medical history is insignificant, including any previous lung infections. Physical examination does not reveal any significant signs indicative of a tumor. A chest CT is ordered and a solitary nodule of 0.5 cm is confirmed. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient? (C) Sputum cytology (A) Positron emission scan (B) Mediastinoscopy (E) Repeat chest CT scan in 6 months (D) CT scan of abdomen
Reason: Given that the patient is 34 years old, has no significant smoking history, and presents with a solitary calcified nodule that has been stable, it is likely a benign granuloma, possibly from a past infection such as histoplasmosis or tuberculosis. The recommendation for a repeat chest CT scan in 6 months is consistent with current guidelines for the management of incidentally discovered pulmonary nodules, allowing for follow-up to monitor for changes while minimizing unnecessary invasive procedures.
Answer: (E) Repeat chest CT scan in 6 months

Let's analyze the question step by step.

The question describes a gunshot victim with a penetrating wound at the level of L3. At this level, we need to consider the anatomy of the major vascular structures in the abdomen and pelvis.

1. **Renal artery**: The renal arteries branch off the abdominal aorta at the level of L1-L2, so they are not likely to be injured at L3.

2. **Inferior vena cava (IVC)**: The IVC runs along the right side of the vertebral column and is located at the level of L5, but it can be affected by injuries at L3 due to its proximity.

3. **Internal iliac artery**: The internal iliac arteries branch off the common iliac arteries, which bifurcate at the level of L4-L5. While they are located in the pelvis, they are not directly at the L3 level.

4. **Internal iliac vein**: Similar to the internal iliac artery, the internal iliac veins are also located in the pelvis and are not directly at the L3 level.

5. **Portal vein**: The portal vein is formed by the union of the superior mesenteric vein and the splenic vein, and it is located more superiorly in the abdomen, typically at the level of L2.

Given this analysis, the most likely vascular structure that could be injured by a penetrating wound at the level of L3 is the **inferior vena cava (IVC)**, as it is in close proximity to that level and can be affected by trauma in that area.

Therefore, the answer is: **(A) Inferior vena cava**.

Question: A 40-year-old woman with a recent history of carcinoma of the breast status post mastectomy and adjuvant chemotherapy one week ago presents for follow-up. She reports adequate pain control managed with the analgesic drug she was prescribed. Past medical history is significant for hepatitis C and major depressive disorder. The patient denies any history of smoking or alcohol use but says she is currently using intravenous heroin and has been for the past 10 years. However, she reports that she has been using much less heroin since she started taking the pain medication, which is confirmed by the toxicology screen. Which of the following is the primary mechanism of action of the analgesic drug she was most likely prescribed? (B) Pure antagonist at opioid receptors (A) Mixed agonist-antagonist at opioid receptors (E) Central action via blockade of serotonin reuptake (C) Inhibits prostaglandin synthesis (D) Pure agonist at the µ-opioid receptor
Reason: The analgesic drug this patient was most likely prescribed is a mixed agonist-antagonist at opioid receptors. This is supported by the fact that patients with a history of substance use disorder, particularly with substances like heroin, may be prescribed such medications to mitigate pain while also addressing their risk of addiction, as mixed agonist-antagonists can provide pain relief without the same level of risk for respiratory depression or euphoria associated with pure agonists.
Answer: (A) Mixed agonist-antagonist at opioid receptors

Question: The physician recommends that the patient receive an influenza vaccine. The patient becomes nervous and reports that he has never received an influenza vaccination because of an allergy to eggs. The allergy was diagnosed many years ago, after he developed hives upon eating scrambled eggs. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? (D) End the examination without additional measures (B) Administer oseltamivir (A) Administer inactivated influenza vaccine (C) Administer influenza immunoglobulins (E) Prescribe oseltamivir for standby emergency treatment
Reason: The most appropriate next step in management is to administer the inactivated influenza vaccine, as it is now widely recognized that individuals with a history of egg allergies can safely receive the inactivated influenza vaccine. Current guidelines suggest that egg-allergic patients may have the vaccine without any special precautions, provided they do not have a history of severe allergic reactions to the vaccine components.

Question: A 45-year-old gentleman with a history of poorly controlled diabetes mellitus is referred to a nephrologist for evaluation of the possibility of early stage kidney failure. Upon evaluation, the nephrologist decides to assess the patient's renal plasma flow by performing a laboratory test. Which of the following substances would be the best for estimating this value? (E) Urea (A) Creatinine (B) Inulin (D) Para-aminohippurate (PAH) (C) Glucose
Reason: The best substance for estimating renal plasma flow is para-aminohippurate (PAH) because it is both freely filtered by the glomeruli and actively secreted by the renal tubules, allowing for a clear measurement of effective renal plasma flow. Unlike creatinine, which is primarily used to estimate glomerular filtration rate, PAH is specifically utilized for assessing renal plasma flow due to its unique pharmacokinetic properties.

Question: A 67-year-old man presents to the emergency department with confusion. The patient is generally healthy, but his wife noticed him becoming progressively more confused as the day went on. The patient is not currently taking any medications and has no recent falls or trauma. His temperature is 102°F (38.9°C), blood pressure is 126/64 mmHg, pulse is 120/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for a confused man who cannot participate in a neurological exam secondary to his confusion. No symptoms are elicited with flexion of the neck and jolt accentuation of headache is negative. Initial laboratory values are unremarkable and the patient's chest radiograph and urinalysis are within normal limits. An initial CT scan of the head is unremarkable. Which of the following is the best next step in management? (C) MRI of the head (B) CT angiogram of the head and neck (D) PCR of the cerebrospinal fluid (E) Vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, and dexamethasone (A) Acyclovir
Reason: The best next step in management is to administer acyclovir due to the concern for viral encephalitis, particularly herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE), given the patient's presentation of confusion, fever, and unremarkable CT scan results. Prompt treatment with acyclovir is critical because early intervention can significantly improve outcomes in cases of HSE, even before confirmatory tests such as PCR of the cerebrospinal fluid are obtained.

Let's analyze the case step by step.

1. **Patient Presentation**: The 35-year-old woman has intermittent episodes of heart palpitations, chest pain localized to the left 3rd intercostal space, a pulse of 110/min that is irregularly irregular, and signs of hyperthyroidism (fine tremor, digital swelling, retraction of the left upper eyelid). 

2. **Clinical Signs**: The irregularly irregular pulse suggests atrial fibrillation, which is often associated with hyperthyroidism. The presence of tremors and eyelid retraction further supports this diagnosis.

3. **Heart Murmur**: The systolic ejection murmur heard along the right upper sternal border could indicate aortic stenosis or flow-related murmurs, but in the context of hyperthyroidism, it may be related to increased cardiac output.

4. **Management of Atrial Fibrillation**: In patients with atrial fibrillation, especially when associated with hyperthyroidism, the primary goal is to control the heart rate and manage the underlying hyperthyroid condition.

5. **Pharmacotherapy Options**:
   - **Propranolol (A)**: A non-selective beta-blocker that can help control heart rate and alleviate symptoms of hyperthyroidism.
   - **Diltiazem (E)**: A calcium channel blocker that can also be used to control heart rate in atrial fibrillation.
   - **Digoxin (B)**: Can be used for rate control but is less effective in hyperthyroid patients due to increased heart rate.
   - **Amiodarone (C)**: An antiarrhythmic that can be used for rhythm control but is not the first line for rate control.
   - **Warfarin (D)**: An anticoagulant used to prevent thromboembolism in atrial fibrillation but does not address the immediate symptoms.

Given the patient's symptoms of hyperthyroidism and atrial fibrillation, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy to control her heart rate and alleviate symptoms would be **Propranolol (A)**.

Question: A 72-year-old man with type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and systolic heart failure comes to the physician because of a 5-day history of progressively worsening shortness of breath at rest. Physical examination shows jugular venous distention, diffuse crackles over the lower lung fields, and bilateral lower extremity edema. As a part of treatment, he is given a derivative of a hormone that acts by altering guanylate cyclase activity. This drug has been found to reduce pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and causes systemic hypotension as an adverse effect. The drug is most likely a derivative of which of the following hormones? (D) Prostacyclin (C) Brain natriuretic peptide (B) Aldosterone (E) Somatostatin (A) Angiotensin II
Reason: The reasoning behind the answer is that the drug described is likely a synthetic derivative of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), which acts by promoting vasodilation through the stimulation of guanylate cyclase activity. In this case, the reduction in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure indicates effective treatment for heart failure symptoms, while the drug's potential to cause systemic hypotension aligns with the vasodilatory effects of BNP.

Menarche was at the age of 13 years. Menses occur at regular 28-day intervals and last 5–6 days with moderate flow. She is sexually active with one male partner. Her only medication is a combination oral contraceptive. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 88 kg (193 lb); BMI is 31 kg/m2. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows coarse dark hair on the upper lip and periumbilical and periareolar skin. Her external genitalia appear normal. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Midcycle serum studies show:
Fasting glucose 95 mg/dL
Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate 3.1 μg/mL (N = 0.5–5.4)
Luteinizing hormone 95 mIU/mL
Follicle-stimulating hormone 75 mIU/mL
17α-Hydroxyprogesterone 190 ng/dL (N = 20–300)
Testosterone 1.1 nmol/L (N < 3.5)
Dihydrotestosterone 435 pg/mL (N < 300)
A urine pregnancy test is negative. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptom?" (B) Androgen-producing tumor of the adrenals (A) Increased activity of 5-alpha reductase (C) Deficiency of 21-hydroxylase (D) Peripheral insulin resistance (E) Tumor of granulosa-theca cells of the ovary
"
Reason: The reasoning behind the answer is that the patient displays signs consistent with hirsutism and elevated levels of dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which is often a result of increased activity of the enzyme 5-alpha reductase converting testosterone to its more potent form, DHT. The normal levels of testosterone and the specific elevation in DHT, alongside her symptoms, suggest that increased 5-alpha reductase activity is the most likely underlying cause of her excessive hair growth rather than other options that would typically present differently.
Answer: (A) Increased activity of 5-alpha reductase

Question: A 3-year-old male presents with his parents to a pediatrician for a new patient visit. The child was recently adopted and little is known about his prior medical or family history. The parents report that the child seems to be doing well, but they are concerned because the patient is much larger than any of the other 3-year-olds in his preschool class. They report that he eats a varied diet at home, and that they limit juice and snack foods. On physical exam, the patient is in the 73rd percentile for weight, 99th percentile for height, and 86th percentile for head circumference. He appears mildly developmentally delayed. He has a fair complexion and tall stature with a prominent sternum. The patient also has joint hypermobility and hyperelastic skin. He appears to have poor visual acuity and is referred to an ophthalmologist, who diagnoses downward lens subluxation of the right eye.

This child is most likely to develop which of the following complications? (D) Thromboembolic stroke (B) Medullary thyroid cancer (E) Wilms tumor (A) Aortic dissection (C) Osteoarthritis
Reason: The reasoning behind the answer is that the child's features, including tall stature, joint hypermobility, skin hyperelasticity, and lens subluxation, are suggestive of Marfan syndrome, a connective tissue disorder. Individuals with Marfan syndrome have an increased risk of cardiovascular complications, particularly aortic dissection, but they can also develop thromboembolic complications due to the increased incidence of vascular abnormalities and heart valve issues associated with the syndrome, which may lead to a higher risk of strokes as well. 
Answer: (D) Thromboembolic stroke

Let's think step by step. 

The question is about the rationale behind conjugating capsular polysaccharides to protein carriers in vaccine development, particularly for vaccines against encapsulated bacteria like Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib).

1. **Understanding Polysaccharide Vaccines**: Capsular polysaccharides are T cell-independent antigens, meaning they can stimulate B cells directly without the help of T cells. However, this type of response is typically weaker and does not lead to the generation of high-affinity IgG antibodies or immunological memory.

2. **Role of Protein Carriers**: By conjugating polysaccharides to protein carriers (like tetanus toxoid), the immune response is converted to a T cell-dependent response. This allows for:
   - Activation of T helper cells, which in turn help B cells produce high-affinity IgG antibodies.
   - Generation of immunological memory, which is crucial for long-term protection.

3. **Infant Immunity**: Infants have immature immune systems and often do not respond well to T cell-independent antigens. Conjugating polysaccharides to protein carriers enhances the immune response in infants, making the vaccine more effective.

4. **Antibody Response**: The conjugation leads to a more robust IgG response rather than just IgM, which is typically produced in T cell-independent responses.

Given this understanding, the best response to the medical student's question is:

**(E) Conjugation with a protein carrier provides effective protection to infants.**

This option highlights the importance of the conjugation in enhancing the immune response, particularly in the vulnerable infant population.

Question: A 56-year-old man comes to the clinic complaining of intermittent abdominal pain for the past 2 months. He reports that the pain improves with oral intake and is concentrated at the epigastric area. The pain is described as gnawing in quality and improves when he takes his wife’s ranitidine. He denies weight changes, fever, chest pain, or recent travel but endorses “brain fog” and decreased libido. An upper endoscopy reveals ulcerations at the duodenum and jejunum. Physical examination demonstrates bilateral hemianopsia, gynecomastia, and diffuse pain upon palpation at the epigastric area. Laboratory findings are demonstrated below:

Serum:
Na+: 137 mEq/dL
Cl-: 96 mEq/L
K+: 3.9 mEq/dL
HCO3-: 25 mEq/L
Glucose: 110 mg/dL
Creatinine: .7 mg/dL
Ca2+: 13.5 mg/dL

What is the best explanation for this patient’s findings? (B) Infection with Helicobacter pylori (C) Mutation of the APC gene (E) Mutation of the RET gene (D) Mutation of the MEN1 gene (A) Gastrin secreting tumor of the pancreas
Reason: The best explanation for this patient's findings is (D) mutation of the MEN1 gene, as he presents with symptoms consistent with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 1 (MEN1), which includes hyperparathyroidism, pancreatic endocrine tumors, and pituitary tumors. The presence of elevated calcium levels (hypercalcemia) and the signs of bilateral hemianopsia and gynecomastia point towards an endocrine disturbance that could be related to this genetic condition.
Answer: (D) Mutation of the MEN1 gene

Question: A 25-year-old man comes to the physician because of left-sided knee pain for 2 weeks. The pain started while playing basketball after suddenly hearing a popping sound. He has been unable to run since this incident. He has asthma, allergic rhinitis, and had a progressive bilateral sensorineural hearing impairment at birth treated with cochlear implants. His only medication is a salbutamol inhaler. The patient appears healthy and well-nourished. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 67/min, and blood pressure is 120/80 mm Hg. Examination of the left knee shows medial joint line tenderness. Total knee extension is not possible and a clicking sound is heard when the knee is extended. An x-ray of the left knee shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient? (C) Reassurance and follow-up (E) Arthroscopy of the left knee (A) Arthrocentesis of the left knee (B) Open meniscal repair (D) MRI scan of the left knee
Reason: The most appropriate next step in the management of this patient is (E) arthroscopy of the left knee because his symptoms, including a "popping" sound, medial joint line tenderness, and clicking upon extension, are indicative of a potential meniscal tear or other intra-articular injury. Since the x-ray findings are normal and his symptoms persist, an arthroscopy allows for direct visualization and potential treatment of any underlying structural issues in the knee.
Answer: (E) Arthroscopy of the left knee

Question: A 40-year-old woman visits your office with her pathology report after being subjected to total abdominal hysterectomy a month ago. She explains that she went through this procedure after a long history of lower abdominal pain that worsened during menses and heavy menstrual bleeding. She is a mother of 5 children, and they are all delivered by cesarean section. The pathology gross examination report and microscopic examination report from the specimen from surgery describes an enlarged, globular uterus with invading clusters of endometrial tissue within the myometrium. What is the most likely diagnosis for this patient? (C) Uterine adenomyosis (A) Endometrial carcinoma (D) Endometrial polyp (E) Endometrial hyperplasia (B) Uterine leiomyoma
Reason: The most likely diagnosis for this patient is (C) uterine adenomyosis, as indicated by the findings of invading clusters of endometrial tissue within the myometrium, which is characteristic of this condition. The patient's symptoms of chronic pelvic pain that worsens during menses and heavy menstrual bleeding further correlate with the typical presentation of adenomyosis, as it involves abnormal endometrial tissue present in the muscular wall of the uterus.
Answer: (C) Uterine adenomyosis

Question: A 59-year-old man comes to the clinic for an annual well-exam. He was lost to follow-up for the past 3 years due to marital issues but reports that he feels fine. The patient reports, “I feel tired but it is probably because I am getting old. I do feel a little feverish today - I think I got a cold.” His past medical history is significant for hypertension that is controlled with hydrochlorothiazide. He reports fatigue, congestion, cough, and night sweats. He denies any sick contacts, recent travel, weight changes, chest pain, or dizziness. His temperature is 101°F (38.3°C), blood pressure is 151/98 mmHg, pulse is 97/min, and respirations are 15/min. His laboratory values are shown below:

Hemoglobin: 13.5 g/dL
Hematocrit: 41%
Leukocyte count:  25,000/mm^3
Segmented neutrophils: 73%
Bands: 8% 
Eosinophils: 1%
Basophils: 2%
Lymphocytes: 15%
Monocytes: 2%
Platelet count: 200,000/mm^3

What diagnostic test would be helpful in distinguishing this patient’s condition from pneumonia? (D) Magnetic resonance imaging of the chest (C) Leukocyte alkaline phosphatase (B) Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (A) C-reactive protein (E) Presence of smudge cells
Reason: The diagnostic test that would be helpful in distinguishing this patient's condition from pneumonia is (C) leukocyte alkaline phosphatase (LAP) levels. This patient presents with leukocytosis and symptoms such as fatigue, fever, and night sweats, which could suggest either an infectious process (like pneumonia) or a hematologic condition (such as chronic myeloid leukemia). Measuring LAP levels can help differentiate between myeloid and reactive leukocytosis, as LAP is usually low in chronic myeloid leukemia, and higher in infections like pneumonia.
Answer: (C) Leukocyte alkaline phosphatase

Question: A 7-year-old girl is brought to the physician by her mother because of a 2-week history of generalized fatigue, intermittent fever, and progressively worsening shortness of breath. Physical examination shows pallor, jugular venous distention, and nontender cervical and axillary lymphadenopathy. Inspiratory stridor is heard on auscultation of the chest. The liver is palpated 3 cm below the right costal margin. Her hemoglobin concentration is 9.5 g/dL, leukocyte count is 66,000 mm3, and platelet count is 102,000 mm3. An x-ray of the chest shows a mediastinal mass. A bone marrow aspirate predominantly shows leukocytes and presence of 35% lymphoblasts. Which of the following additional findings is most likely in this patient? (B) Positive myeloperoxidase staining (E) Positive CD3/CD7 staining (A) t(8;14) translocation (C) t(9;22) translocation (D) Reed-Sternberg cells
Reason: The additional finding most likely in this patient is (E) positive CD3/CD7 staining, indicative of T-cell lineage, as the clinical presentation and laboratory findings suggest acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The presence of lymphoblasts in the bone marrow, the elevated leukocyte count, and the mediastinal mass, combined with age and symptoms, point towards T-cell ALL, which is characterized by positive immunophenotyping for T-cell markers such as CD3 and CD7.
Answer: (E) Positive CD3/CD7 staining

Question: A 26-year-old woman, gravida 1, para 0, at 22 weeks' gestation is brought to the emergency department by her husband because of a 2-day history of confusion and falls. Pregnancy has been complicated by excessive vomiting and an 8-kg (17-lb) weight loss over the past 10 weeks. Physical examination shows vertical nystagmus and a wide-based gait. Muscle tone and tendon reflexes are diminished in all extremities. An MRI of the brain shows periventricular diffusion abnormalities. Treatment is initiated with a vitamin followed by a dextrose infusion. The primary reason to administer the vitamin first is to ensure the function of which of the following enzymes? (C) α-Ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (E) Succinate dehydrogenase (B) Methionine synthase (D) Fatty acid synthase (A) Pyruvate carboxylase
Reason: The primary reason to administer the vitamin first is to ensure the function of (C) α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase because this enzyme requires thiamine (vitamin B1) as a cofactor, and its deficiency can lead to neurological symptoms. In this pregnant woman, her excessive vomiting and weight loss suggest possible thiamine deficiency, which could impair the function of multiple enzymes in the Krebs cycle, including α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, causing metabolic disturbances that lead to her neurological symptoms.
Answer: (C) α-Ketoglutarate dehydrogenase

Question: A 35-year-old man and his 9-year-old son are brought to the emergency department following a high-speed motor vehicle collision. The father was the restrained driver. He is conscious. His pulse is 135/min and his blood pressure is 76/55 mm Hg. His hemoglobin concentration is 5.9 g/dL. His son sustained multiple body contusions and loss of consciousness. He remains unresponsive in the emergency department. A focused assessment of the boy with sonography is concerning for multiple organ lacerations and internal bleeding. The physician decides to move the man's son to the operating room for emergency surgical exploration. The father says that he and his son are Jehovah's witnesses and do not want blood transfusions. The physician calls the boy's biological mother who confirms this religious belief. She also asks the physician to wait for her arrival before any other medical decisions are undertaken. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step for the physician? (B) Proceed to surgery on the son without transfusion (E) Wait for the son's mother before providing further treatment (D) Transfuse packed red blood cells to the son but not to father (C) Seek a court order for medical treatment of the son (A) Consult hospital ethics committee for medical treatment of the son
Reason: The most appropriate next step for the physician is (D) transfuse packed red blood cells to the son but not to the father, with the understanding that medical emergencies may override certain religious beliefs when the patient's life is at immediate risk. In this situation, the son is in critical condition due to multiple organ lacerations and internal bleeding, and timely intervention, including blood transfusion, is essential to save his life, which may necessitate prioritizing his medical needs over the religious beliefs expressed by the father and confirmed by the mother.
Answer: (D) Transfuse packed red blood cells to the son but not to father

Question: A 55-year-old man presents to the hospital with chief complaints of unintentional weight loss, anorexia, fever, and sweating. The patient has pleuritic chest pain, progressive dyspnea, and dry cough. There is no history of orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. On examination, the patient is afebrile and pericardial friction rub is noted. ECG shows diffuse ST-segment elevation in V1-V4 along with T wave inversion. Chest X-ray and CT scan show anterior and inferior pericardial eggshell calcification. Echocardiography reveals thickened pericardium and signs of diastolic right ventricular collapse. Pericardial fluid is sent for Ziehl-Neelsen staining to detect acid-fast bacilli. Mycobacterium tuberculosis is detected by PCR. What is the most likely mechanism associated with the patient’s condition? (B) Dystrophic calcification (E) Age-related amyloidosis (D) Secondary amyloidosis (C) Primary amyloidosis (A) Metastatic calcifications
Reason: The most likely mechanism associated with the patient’s condition is (B) dystrophic calcification, as it occurs in the context of tissue injury or inflammation, particularly in conditions like tuberculosis that can lead to granulomatous disease involving the pericardium. In this case, the eggshell calcification around the pericardium is a classic sign of past inflammatory processes, such as tuberculosis, that have resulted in calcification of previously damaged tissue, consistent with dystrophic calcification rather than metastatic calcification, which typically occurs in the setting of hypercalcemia.
Answer: (B) Dystrophic calcification

Let's think step by step. 

The patient has poorly controlled hypertension and is already on enalapril (an ACE inhibitor) and metformin (for diabetes). The physician adds another antihypertensive medication, and one month later, the patient presents with new onset lower extremity swelling.

Among the options provided:

- (A) Metoprolol: This is a beta-blocker, which is less commonly associated with peripheral edema.
- (B) Verapamil: This is a calcium channel blocker, but it is more likely to cause constipation than peripheral edema.
- (C) Nifedipine: This is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker that is known to cause peripheral edema as a side effect.
- (D) Hydrochlorothiazide: This is a thiazide diuretic, which typically does not cause peripheral edema and is more likely to cause electrolyte imbalances.
- (E) Spironolactone: This is a potassium-sparing diuretic, which can cause some fluid retention but is not typically associated with significant peripheral edema.

Given that the patient developed lower extremity swelling after the addition of a new antihypertensive medication, the most likely medication prescribed is (C) Nifedipine, as it is known to cause peripheral edema.

Answer: (C) Nifedipine

Question: A 4-month-old girl with Down syndrome is brought into the pediatrician’s office by her father for her first well-child visit. The father states she was a home birth at 39 weeks gestation after an uneventful pregnancy without prenatal care. The child has not received any routine immunizations. The father states that sometimes when she is crying or nursing she "gets a little blue", but otherwise the patient is healthy. The patient is within the normal range of weight and height. Her blood pressure is 110/45 mm Hg, the pulse is 185/min, the respiratory rate is 25/min, and the temperature is 37.1°C (98.7°F). The physician notes an elevated heart rate, widened pulse pressure, and some difficulty breathing. On exam, the patient is playful and in no apparent distress. On lung exam, some faint crackles are heard at the lung bases without wheezing. Cardiac exam is significant for a harsh, machine-like murmur. An echocardiogram verifies the diagnosis. What is the next step in treatment of this patient? (B) Indomethacin (A) Antibiotics (E) Heart transplant (D) Emergent open heart surgery (C) PGE2
Reason: The answer is (B) Indomethacin because the clinical presentation suggests a diagnosis of a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), which is common in infants with Down syndrome. Indomethacin can help close a PDA by inhibiting prostaglandin production, thus facilitating the closure of the ductus arteriosus and improving cardiac function.
Answer: (B) Indomethacin

Question: A 70-year-old man comes to the physician for evaluation of worsening nocturia, fatigue, and shortness of breath on exertion. While he used to be able to walk for 15 minutes at a time, he now has to pause every 5 minutes. Recently, he has started using two pillows to avoid waking up short of breath at night. He has a history of hypertension treated with daily amlodipine and prazosin; he has difficulty adhering to his medication regimen. His pulse is 75/min, and blood pressure is 150/90 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a laterally displaced apical heartbeat and 2+ bilateral pitting edema of the lower legs. Auscultation shows an S4 gallop and fine bibasilar rales. Further evaluation is most likely to show which of the following pathophysiologic changes in this patient? (E) Retention of potassium (D) Reduction of alveolar surface tension (B) Increase in urinary bicarbonate excretion (A) Constriction of efferent renal arterioles (C) Decrease in total peripheral vascular resistance
Reason: The answer is (A) Constriction of efferent renal arterioles because the patient's symptoms are consistent with heart failure, leading to reduced renal perfusion. In response to decreased blood flow, the kidneys may activate the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), resulting in the constriction of efferent arterioles to maintain glomerular filtration rate and blood pressure.
Answer: (A) Constriction of efferent renal arterioles

Question: A 4-year-old male presents to the pediatrician with a one week history of fever, several days of bloody diarrhea, and right-sided abdominal pain. The mother explains that several other children at his son's pre-K have been having similar symptoms. She heard the daycare owner had similar symptoms and may have her appendix removed, but the mother claims this may just have been a rumor. Based on the history, the pediatrician sends for an abdominal ultrasound, which shows a normal vermiform appendix. She then sends a stool sample for culturing. The cultures demonstrate a Gram-negative bacteria that is motile at 25 C but not at 37 C, non-lactose fermenter, and non-hydrogen sulfide producer. What is the most likely causative agent? (D) Clostridium perfringens (A) Yersinia enterocolitica (C) Vibrio cholerae (E) Rotavirus (B) Enterotoxigenic E. coli
Reason: The answer is (A) Yersinia enterocolitica because the characteristics of the cultured bacteria match this organism: it is a Gram-negative bacterium that is motile at 25°C, which is consistent with Yersinia enterocolitica's growth preferences, and it typically causes gastrointestinal symptoms such as bloody diarrhea and abdominal pain. Additionally, outbreaks of Yersinia enterocolitica infection often occur in settings like daycare centers, supporting the epidemiological context described in the scenario.

Question: A 50-year-old woman, gravida 5, para 5, comes to the physician for the evaluation of decreased sexual desire for approximately 6 months. She has been sexually active with her husband but reports that she has no desire in having sexual intercourse anymore. She states that she feels guilty and is worried about losing her husband if this problem goes on for a longer period of time. She also reports that they have had several fights recently due to financial problems. She has problems going to sleep and wakes up often, and is tired throughout the day. One year ago, the patient underwent hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy due to uterine prolapse. Her last menstrual period was 2 years ago. She does not smoke. She drinks 3–4 glasses of wine daily. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows no abnormalities except for an enlarged liver. Which of the following most likely explains this patient's loss of libido? (E) Stress (A) Chronic alcohol intake (D) Elevated prolactin (B) Major depressive disorder (C) Decreased testosterone
Reason: The answer is (C) Decreased testosterone because the patient underwent a hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, which removed her ovaries and caused a significant drop in estrogen and testosterone production. This hormonal change can lead to sexual dysfunction, including decreased libido, which is consistent with her reported symptoms following the surgery.

Question: A 55-year-old man with a history of fatigue and exertional dyspnea presents to the urgent care clinic following an acute upper respiratory illness. On physical examination, his pulses are bounding, his complexion is very pale, and scleral icterus is apparent. The spleen is moderately enlarged. Oxygen saturation is 79% at rest, with a new oxygen requirement of 9 L by a non-rebreather mask. Laboratory analysis results show a hemoglobin level of 6.8 g/dL. Of the following options, which hypersensitivity reaction does this condition represent? (E) Type II and II–mixed cytotoxic and immune complex hypersensitivity reaction (D) Type IV–cell-mediated (delayed) hypersensitivity reaction (C) Type III–immune complex-mediated hypersensitivity reaction (B) Type II–cytotoxic hypersensitivity reaction (A) Type I–anaphylactic hypersensitivity reaction
Reason: The answer is (B) Type II–cytotoxic hypersensitivity reaction because the patient's presentation of hemolytic anemia, characterized by a low hemoglobin level, jaundice, and splenomegaly, is consistent with this type of hypersensitivity. In Type II hypersensitivity, antibodies target and destroy red blood cells, leading to their destruction and the associated symptoms of anemia and jaundice.

Question: A 20-year-old female presents to the emergency department with squeezing right upper quadrant pain worse after eating. She has a history of a microcytic, hypochromic anemia with target cells. Physical exam shows severe tenderness to palpation in the right upper quadrant and a positive Murphy's sign. By genetic analysis a single point mutation is detected in the gene of interest. Despite this seemingly minor mutation, the protein encoded by this gene is found to be missing a group of 5 consecutive amino acids though the amino acids on either side of this sequence are preserved. This point mutation is most likely located in which of the following regions of the affected gene? (A) Exon (D) Polyadenylation sequence (C) Kozak consensus sequence (E) Transcriptional promoter (B) Intron
Reason: The answer is (A) Exon because the description indicates that a single point mutation in the gene leads to a significant alteration in the protein sequence, specifically the loss of a consecutive group of amino acids. This suggests that the mutation is within the coding region of the gene, which is found in the exon, as introns are non-coding regions that are spliced out during mRNA processing and would not directly affect the amino acid sequence of the protein.
Answer: (A) Exon

Question: A 35-year-old woman presents as a new patient to a primary care physician. She hasn't seen a doctor in many years and came in for a routine check-up. She has no specific complaints, although she has occasional shortness of breath with mild activity. On physical exam, her vital signs are as follows: HR 80, BP 110/70, RR 14. On auscultation, her lungs are clear with equal breath sounds bilaterally. When listening over the precordium, the physician hears a mid-systolic click followed by a late systolic murmur that is loudest over the apex. Valsalva increases the murmur. Which of the following is NOT a possible complication of this patient's underlying problem? (B) Infective endocarditis (E) Sudden death (C) Bleeding from acquired von Willebrand disease (D) Cerebral embolism (A) Atrial fibrilation
Reason: The answer is (C) Bleeding from acquired von Willebrand disease because this condition is generally associated with deficiencies or dysfunctions in von Willebrand factor, which is involved in platelet function and clotting. While the patient's findings suggest mitral valve prolapse (MVP), which can lead to other complications such as arrhythmias and embolic events, bleeding due to von Willebrand disease is not a recognized complication of MVP itself, making it the least associated with her underlying problem.
Answer: (C) Bleeding from acquired von Willebrand disease

Question: A 37-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain. She reports that the pain is not new and usually starts within half an hour of eating a meal. The pain has been previously diagnosed as biliary colic, and she underwent a cholecystectomy three months ago for symptomatic biliary colic. Her liver reportedly looked normal at that time. The patient dates the onset of these episodes to shortly after she underwent a sleeve gastrectomy several years ago, and the episodes were more severe immediately following that surgery. Her postsurgical course was otherwise uncomplicated, and she has lost fifty pounds since then. She has a past medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, osteoarthritis, and obesity. She denies alcohol or tobacco use. Her home medications are hydrochlorothiazide, enalapril, atorvastatin, and vitamin supplements. RUQ ultrasound reveals a surgically absent gallbladder and a dilated common bile duct without evidence of stones. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) shows no evidence of biliary compression or obstruction, and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) shows no evidence of biliary stones or sludge. Laboratory tests are performed which reveal the following:

ALT: 47 U/L
AST: 56 U/L
Alkaline phosphatase: 165 U/L
Total bilirubin: 1.6 g/dL
Amylase: 135 U/L
Lipase: 160 U/L

Which of the following is definitive treatment of this patient's condition? (E) Surgical revascularization (B) Biliary stent (C) Pancreatic enzyme replacement (A) Pancreaticoduodenectomy (D) Sphincterotomy
Reason: The answer is (D) Sphincterotomy because this patient's symptoms and imaging suggest a condition known as sphincter of Oddi dysfunction, which can occur after gallbladder surgery and lead to biliary colic symptoms. The presence of a dilated common bile duct without evidence of obstruction or stones, along with her history of post-surgical pain, indicates that a sphincterotomy would be the appropriate definitive treatment to relieve the dysfunction at the sphincter of Oddi and improve bile flow.
Answer: (D) Sphincterotomy

Let's analyze the situation step by step.

1. **Patient Background**: The patient is a 42-year-old man with type 1 diabetes mellitus who is on insulin therapy. He experiences episodes of waking up at night with symptoms such as excessive sweating, hand tremors, and weakness.

2. **Symptoms Analysis**: The symptoms described (sweating, tremors, weakness) are indicative of hypoglycemia. The fact that he wakes up in the middle of the night with these symptoms suggests that he may be experiencing nocturnal hypoglycemia.

3. **Morning Blood Glucose**: The patient also reports high morning blood glucose levels on repeated measurements. This could indicate that he is experiencing hypoglycemia during the night, which leads to a counter-regulatory response that raises his blood glucose levels in the morning (the "dawn phenomenon" or rebound hyperglycemia).

4. **Intervention Options**:
   - (D) **Increasing daily insulin dose**: This would likely worsen his hypoglycemia and is not appropriate.
   - (A) **Reassurance**: While reassurance is important, it does not address the underlying issue of hypoglycemia.
   - (C) **Adding pramlintide**: Pramlintide is an amylin analog that can help with postprandial glucose control but does not directly address nocturnal hypoglycemia.
   - (E) **Reducing daily insulin dose**: This is a reasonable option, as reducing the insulin dose may help prevent nocturnal hypoglycemia.
   - (B) **Adding diazepam**: Diazepam is a benzodiazepine and is not indicated for managing diabetes or hypoglycemia.

5. **Optimal Intervention**: Given the evidence of nocturnal hypoglycemia and the high morning blood glucose levels, the most appropriate intervention would be to reduce the daily insulin dose to prevent hypoglycemic episodes at night.

**Final Answer**: (E) Reducing daily insulin dose
