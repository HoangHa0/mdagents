The pain is primarily localized to the right side and is non-radiating. The patient is not sexually active at this time and is not currently under any medication. At the hospital, her vitals are normal. A pelvic examination reveals a tender palpable mass on the right adnexal structure. A pelvic CT scan reveals a 7-cm solid adnexal mass that was surgically removed with the ovary. Histological evaluation indicates sheets of uniform cells resembling a 'fried egg', consistent with dysgerminoma. Which of the following tumor markers is most likely elevated with this type of tumor? (E) Cancer antigen 125 (CA-125) (D) Inhibin A (B) Beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) (A) Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (C) Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)
