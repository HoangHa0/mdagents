She has smoked 1 pack per day for 25 years. She is agitated and confused. Her blood pressure is 165/95 mm Hg; pulse 110/min; respirations 35/min; and temperature, 36.7°C (98.1°F). The pulmonary examination shows tachypnea and mild generalized wheezing. Auscultation of the heart shows no abnormal sounds. The remainder of the physical examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show:
Serum
Na+ 138 mEq/L
CI- 100 mEq/L
Arterial blood gas analysis on room air
pH 7.37
pCO2 21 mm Hg
pO2 88 mm Hg
HCO3- 12 mEq/L
Which of the following best explains these findings? (A) Alcoholic ketoacidosis (C) Salicylate intoxication (D) Severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (E) Vomiting (B) Hyperventilation syndrome
Answer: (C) Salicylate intoxication

Fewshot exampler #2:
Question: A 15-year-old girl presents with four days of malaise, painful joints, nodular swelling over her elbows, low-grade fever, and a rash on her chest and left shoulder. Two weeks ago, she complained of a sore throat that gradually improved but was not worked up. She was seen for a follow-up approximately one week later.

What is the mechanism of the drug involved in the adverse reaction? (E) Coating of the gastric lining (C) Binding to the 50S subunit of the ribosome (A) Formation of free radicals (B) Inhibition of H+/K+ ATPase in parietal cells (D) Binding to the 30S subunit of the ribosome
