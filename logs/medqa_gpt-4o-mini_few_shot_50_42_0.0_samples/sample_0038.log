Platelet count 130,000/mm3
Partial thromboplastin time (aPTT)  30 sec
Prothrombin time (PT) 12 sec

A neonatal physical examination demonstrates a lack of a sagittal cranial suture and an APGAR score of 8 and 8, at 1 and 5 minutes respectively. What findings would you expect in the baby? (D) Low hemoglobin (B) High levels of free T4 and total T3 (A) Group B streptococcus in blood (C) High thyroid-stimulating hormone (E) Pericardial effusion
