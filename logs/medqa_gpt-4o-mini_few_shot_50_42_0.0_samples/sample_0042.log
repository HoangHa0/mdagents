Question: A 68-year-old right hand-dominant man presents to the emergency room complaining of severe right arm pain after falling down a flight of stairs. He landed on his shoulder and developed immediate severe upper arm pain. Physical examination reveals a 2-cm laceration in the patient’s anterior right upper arm. Bone is visible through the laceration. An arm radiograph demonstrates a displaced comminuted fracture of the surgical neck of the humerus. Irrigation and debridement is performed immediately and the patient is scheduled to undergo definitive operative management of his fracture.
