[INFO] Generating Few-Shot response with 3 few-shot examplers.

Fewshot exampler #1:
Question: A researcher is studying proteins that contribute to intestinal epithelial permeability. He has isolated intestinal tissue from several mice. After processing the tissue into its individual components, he uses a Western blot analysis to identify a protein that forms part of a multi-protein complex at the apical aspect of epithelial cells. The complex is known to provide a diffusion barrier between the apical and basolateral aspects of epithelial cells. Which of the following proteins is this researcher most likely investigating? (C) Desmoglein (A) Integrin (B) Connexon (D) E-cadherin (E) Claudin
Answer: (E) Claudin

Fewshot exampler #2:
Question: A 62-year-old man presents for evaluation of an adrenal nodule, which was accidentally discovered while performing a computerized tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen for recurrent abdominal pain. The CT was negative except for a 3 cm low-density, well-circumscribed nodule in the left adrenal gland. He reports weight gain of 12 kg (26.4 lb) over the past 3 years. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension, which have been difficult to control with medications. Which of the following is the best initial test for this patient? (C) 1 mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test (D) Pituitary magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (B) CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis (E) Inferior petrosal sampling (A) ACTH stimulation test
Answer: (C) 1 mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test

Fewshot exampler #3:
Question: An investigator is studying the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen in different clinical settings. An illustration of an oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve is shown. Curve A shows the test results of one of the research participants and curve B shows a normal oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve. Which of the following is most likely present in this research participant? (D) Serum pH of 7.1 (E) Polycythemia (C) Neutrophilia (A) Temperature of 39.1°C (102.4°F) (B) Sickled red blood cells
Answer: (E) Polycythemia
Answer: (E) Conjugation with a protein carrier provides effective protection to infants
