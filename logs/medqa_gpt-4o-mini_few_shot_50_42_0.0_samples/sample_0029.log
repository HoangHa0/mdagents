Question: A 30-month-old toddler presents with his mother to the pediatrician for a scheduled follow-up. She is concerned that his appetite has been poor since the death of his father, approximately one year ago. She denies any history of vomiting, refusal of food, diarrhea, constipation, recurrent cough and colds, recurrent wheezing, fast breathing, recurrent fever, or recurrent infections. The boy was born at full term by vaginal delivery with an uneventful neonatal period and infancy. His vaccines are up to date. On physical examination, his vital signs are stable. His complete physical examination does not suggest a specific medical disorder or congenital abnormality. His detailed diagnostic evaluation, including complete blood counts, serum protein, liver function tests, and urinalysis are normal. The pediatrician reviews the patient’s growth chart.
At the age of 18 months he was at the 90th percentile for weight and 75th for height. After plotting his current growth parameters on the growth charts, the pediatrician suspects failure to thrive with psychosocial etiology. Based on which of the following findings on the growth charts did the pediatrician suspect the condition? (C) Present gender-specific height for age between 90 and 75 percentile markers (B) Present gender-specific weight for age between 75 and 50 percentile markers (E) Present gender-specific weight for height between 90 and 95 percentile markers (D) Present gender-specific height for age between 75 and 50 percentile markers (A) Present gender-specific weight for age between 90 and 75 percentile markers
