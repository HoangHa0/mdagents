The pathogen identified on sputum culture is found to be resistant to multiple drugs, including streptomycin. Which of the following mechanisms is most likely involved in bacterial resistance to this drug? (B) Inhibition of bacterial synthesis of RNA (E) Upregulation of arabinosyl transferase production (A) Alteration in the sequence of gyrA genes (D) Upregulation of mycolic acid synthesis (C) Alteration in 30S ribosomal subunit
Answer: (C) Alteration in 30S ribosomal subunit
