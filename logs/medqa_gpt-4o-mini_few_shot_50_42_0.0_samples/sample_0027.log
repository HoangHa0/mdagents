Question: A 52-year-old man is seen by his endocrinologist for routine followup of his type 2 diabetes. Although he has previously been on a number of medication regimens, his A1C has remained significantly elevated. In order to try to better control his glucose level, the endocrinologist prescribes a new medication. He explains that this new medication works by blocking the ability of his kidneys to reabsorb glucose and therefore causes glucose wasting in the urine. Which of the following medications has this mechanism of action? (E) Metformin (A) Acarbose (C) Exenatide (B) Canagliflozin (D) Glyburide
Answer: (B) Canagliflozin
