Current medications include metformin and atorvastatin. She is 163 cm (5 ft 4 in) tall and weighs 91 kg (200 lb); BMI is 34 kg/m2. Her temperature is 38.8°C (101.8°F), pulse is 100/min, respirations are 14/min, and blood pressure is 150/76 mm Hg. Abdominal examination shows right upper quadrant tenderness with guarding. A bedside ultrasound shows a gall bladder wall measuring 6 mm, pericholecystic fluid, sloughing of the intraluminal membrane, and a 2 x 2-cm stone at the neck of the gallbladder. The common bile duct appears unremarkable. Laboratory studies show leukocytosis and normal liver function tests. Intravenous fluids are started, and she is given ketorolac for pain control. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? (B) Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (A) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast (E) Elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy in 6 weeks (C) Antibiotic therapy (D) Emergent open cholecystectomy
Answer: (C) Antibiotic therapy

Fewshot exampler #2:
Question: During an experiment, an investigator attempts to determine the rates of apoptosis in various tissue samples.

Apoptosis is most likely due to secretion of which of the following substances in this case? (C) TNF-α (A) Cytochrome C (B) Bcl-2 (D) Granzyme B (E) Caspases
Answer: (D) Granzyme B

Fewshot exampler #3:
Question: An investigator develops a new drug that decreases the number of voltage-gated potassium channels in cardiac muscle cell membranes. Which of the following is the most likely effect of this drug on the myocardial action potential? (E) Accelerated repolarization (B) Accelerated depolarization (C) Delayed repolarization (D) Delayed depolarization (A) Decreased resting membrane potential
Answer: (C) Delayed repolarization
Answer: (C) Thoracic aortic rupture
