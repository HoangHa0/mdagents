[INFO] Final decision: {0.3: "Let's think step by step. The child is a 21-month-old boy who has deformities in both legs that have been noticed since he started walking. The examination reveals that the knees do not stay together when the feet and ankles are placed together, which suggests a possible condition like genu varum (bowleggedness), which is common in toddlers and often resolves on its own as they grow.\n\nGiven that the child is otherwise healthy, has normal developmental milestones, and is within normal growth percentiles, the most appropriate next step in management would be reassurance and follow-up. In many cases, bowleggedness in toddlers is a normal variant and does not require immediate intervention unless there are significant concerns or associated symptoms.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate next step in management is:\n(B) Reassurance and follow-up."}
