[INFO] Step 2. Initial Opinions
 Agent 1 (👩🏻‍⚕️ immunologist) : The best response to the student's question about why capsular polysaccharides are conjugated to protein carriers like tetanus toxoid during vaccine development is:

**(C) Polysaccharides conjugated with proteins are T cell-independent antigens.**

Capsular polysaccharides alone typically elicit a T cell-independent immune response, which can lead to a weaker and less durable antibody response, primarily dominated by IgM. By conjugating the polysaccharides to a protein carrier, the resulting conjugate vaccine can elicit a T cell-dependent immune response. This allows for the generation of a more robust and long-lasting IgG response, including IgG2, and can lead to immunological memory, which is particularly important for effective protection, especially in young infants whose immune systems are still developing. Thus, while option (C) recognizes a critical aspect of the relationship between polysaccharides and immune responses, it fails to acknowledge that the conjugation process actually enhances T cell involvement, ultimately improving the vaccine's effectiveness.
 Agent 2 (👨🏽‍⚕️ pediatrician) : The best response to the medical student's question about why capsular polysaccharides are conjugated to protein carriers during vaccine development is:

**(E) Conjugation with a protein carrier provides effective protection to infants.**

This is because polysaccharide vaccines typically elicit a T cell-independent response, which is less effective in young children, particularly infants. By conjugating the polysaccharide to a protein carrier, the immune response is converted into a T cell-dependent response, leading to improved immunogenicity, better affinity maturation, and class switching to IgG, which is important for long-lasting immunity. This approach is particularly effective for providing protective immunity against encapsulated bacteria in vulnerable populations like infants.
 Agent 3 (🧑🏽‍⚕️ microbiologist) : The best response to the medical student’s question regarding why capsular polysaccharides are conjugated to protein carriers like tetanus toxoid during vaccine development is:

(E) Conjugation with a protein carrier provides effective protection to infants.

This is because polysaccharide antigens on their own generally elicit a T cell-independent immune response, leading primarily to IgM production and limited immunological memory. However, when conjugated to a protein carrier, these polysaccharides can stimulate a T cell-dependent immune response, resulting in the production of class-switched antibodies (such as IgG) and improved immunological memory. This is particularly important for infants and young children, who may not mount strong immune responses to polysaccharide-only vaccines.

[INFO] Step 4. Final Decision
👨‍⚖️  Moderator's final decision: {0.3: "The best response to the medical student's question about why capsular polysaccharides are conjugated to protein carriers like tetanus toxoid during vaccine development is:\n\n**(E) Conjugation with a protein carrier provides effective protection to infants.**\n\nThis response is supported by the consensus among the experts, who highlighted that polysaccharide vaccines typically elicit a T cell-independent immune response, which is less effective, especially in infants. By conjugating the polysaccharide to a protein carrier, the immune response shifts to a T cell-dependent response, leading to improved immunogenicity, class switching to IgG, and enhanced immunological memory. This is particularly crucial for providing effective protection against encapsulated bacteria in vulnerable populations like infants."}
