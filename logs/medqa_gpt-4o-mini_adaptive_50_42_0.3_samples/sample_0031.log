[INFO] Final decision: {0.3: "Let's analyze the situation step by step. The patient is a 12-year-old boy with spontaneous unilateral nasal bleeding (epistaxis) from the left nostril. He is currently applying pressure to the area, which is a common first step in managing epistaxis. \n\nIn cases of anterior epistaxis, which is the most common type, initial management typically involves:\n\n1. **Manual compression**: Squeezing the nostrils together for about 10 minutes while keeping the head elevated can help to control the bleeding by applying direct pressure to the bleeding site.\n\n2. **Topical vasoconstrictors**: If manual pressure does not resolve the bleeding, topical agents like oxymetazoline can be used to help constrict blood vessels.\n\nGiven that the boy is already applying pressure and the question asks for the most appropriate initial therapy, the best answer is:\n\n**(E) Squeezing the nostrils manually for 10 minutes with the head elevated.**\n\nThis method is the first-line treatment for managing epistaxis and should be attempted before considering other interventions."}
