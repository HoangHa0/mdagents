[INFO] Final decision: {0.3: "Let's analyze the case step by step. The patient is a 25-year-old man who was found unconscious after exhibiting belligerent behavior at a party. He has a history of vomiting, altered mental status, muscle rigidity, and hyperthermia (temperature of 103°F). These symptoms, especially the muscle rigidity and hyperthermia, raise suspicion for a serious condition such as neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) or serotonin syndrome, particularly given the context of potential substance use at a party.\n\nGiven that the patient is experiencing muscle rigidity and hyperthermia, the best next step in management is to administer dantrolene, which is effective in treating hyperthermia and muscle rigidity associated with NMS. While supportive therapy is important, the presence of severe muscle rigidity and hyperthermia indicates that more specific treatment is warranted.\n\nTherefore, the best next step in management is:\n**Answer: (B) Dantrolene**"}
