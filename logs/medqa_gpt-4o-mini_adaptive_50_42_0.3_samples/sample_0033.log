[INFO] Step 2. Initial Opinions
 Agent 1 (👩🏼‍⚕️ adolescent medicine specialist) : Given the details you provided about the patient, it seems she is exhibiting signs consistent with binge eating disorder (BED) or potentially bulimia nervosa, including the enlarged cheeks (suggestive of parotid gland enlargement) and calluses on the hands (indicative of inducing vomiting, commonly referred to as "Russell's sign"). 

If we consider the implications of binge eating and the potential for purging behavior, erosion of tooth enamel would be a significant finding. This occurs due to the exposure of teeth to stomach acid when vomiting. 

Therefore, the most expected finding in this patient would be:

(C) Erosion of tooth enamel.
 Agent 2 (👨🏿‍⚕️ endocrinologist) : Based on the clinical presentation you provided, the 17-year-old woman exhibits signs suggestive of binge eating disorder, which can be associated with significant stress and is characterized by episodes of eating large amounts of food with a sense of loss of control, often followed by distress. She has an absence of menstruation for four months, which can indicate a physiological response to high stress levels, potential hormonal imbalances, or nutritional deficiencies.

The key physical findings mentioned—enlarged cheeks bilaterally and calluses on the dorsum of her hands—are indicative of frequent vomiting, which is consistent with behaviors seen in bulimia nervosa rather than binge eating disorder alone. The enlarged cheeks could be a result of parotid gland enlargement due to vomiting, and the calluses on the hands (often referred to as "Russell's sign") can occur when individuals induce vomiting with their hands.

Given this context, the most relevant additional finding that aligns with the eating disorder behaviors described would be:

(C) Erosion of tooth enamel

Erosion of tooth enamel is a common consequence of repeated exposure to gastric acid from vomiting. Therefore, this finding would be expected in this patient.
 Agent 3 (👨🏽‍⚕️ psychiatrist) : Given the information provided, the 17-year-old woman is exhibiting signs consistent with binge eating behavior and potential bulimia nervosa, particularly with the presence of calluses on the dorsum of her hands (often referred to as "Russell's sign" due to self-induced vomiting) and enlarged cheeks (which could suggest parotid gland enlargement).

In cases of bulimia nervosa, one common finding is erosion of tooth enamel due to the effects of the stomach acid from vomiting. Thus, the expected finding in this scenario would be:

(C) Erosion of tooth enamel. 

Other options like enlarged thyroid or increased blood glucose levels are less directly associated with her symptoms and presentation.

[INFO] Step 4. Final Decision
👨‍⚖️  Moderator's final decision: {0.3: 'Based on the consensus among the experts and their reasoning, the final answer to the question regarding the expected finding in the 17-year-old woman presenting with signs suggestive of binge eating disorder or bulimia nervosa is:\n\n(C) Erosion of tooth enamel.\n\nAll experts agree that the presence of calluses on the hands and enlarged cheeks indicates behaviors associated with bulimia nervosa, and erosion of tooth enamel is a common consequence of repeated vomiting due to exposure to gastric acid. This finding aligns well with the clinical presentation and the expert opinions provided.'}
