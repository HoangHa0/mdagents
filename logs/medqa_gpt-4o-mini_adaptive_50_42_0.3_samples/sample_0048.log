[INFO] Step 1. Expert Recruitment
Agent 1 (👩🏻‍⚕️ Cardiologist): Focuses on the diagnosis and treatment of heart and blood vessel-related conditions, particularly hypertension.
Agent 2 (👨🏽‍⚕️ Endocrinologist): Specializes in managing diabetes and understanding its interactions with cardiovascular health and medications.
Agent 3 (👨🏿‍⚕️ Pharmacologist): Expert in the effects and mechanisms of medications, particularly in the context of hypertension treatment and side effects.

[INFO] Step 2. Initial Opinions
 Agent 1 (👩🏻‍⚕️ cardiologist) : Given the patient's history of poorly controlled hypertension and the new onset of lower extremity swelling after the addition of a new antihypertensive medication, the most likely medication prescribed is (C) Nifedipine.

Nifedipine is a calcium channel blocker that is commonly used to treat hypertension. One of the known side effects of nifedipine and other dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers is peripheral edema, which can lead to swelling in the lower extremities. This side effect is particularly prominent with long-acting formulations. 

Other options, such as hydrochlorthiazide and spironolactone, can also lead to different types of fluid imbalance and electrolyte abnormalities, but they do not typically cause peripheral edema as a primary side effect. Metoprolol is a beta-blocker, which is less likely to cause lower extremity swelling as a significant side effect, and verapamil, another calcium channel blocker, is more commonly associated with constipation than peripheral edema.

Thus, the most likely medication that was added and resulted in lower extremity swelling is **nifedipine**.
 Agent 2 (👨🏽‍⚕️ endocrinologist) : Given that the patient has developed new onset lower extremity swelling after the addition of a new antihypertensive medication, the most likely option among the choices provided is (C) Nifedipine. 

Nifedipine is a calcium channel blocker that can cause peripheral edema as a side effect due to its vasodilatory effects, which can lead to an increase in capillary hydrostatic pressure, resulting in fluid being pushed into the interstitial spaces.

Other options:
- (D) Hydrochlorothiazide: This is a thiazide diuretic that usually decreases fluid retention and is less likely to cause edema.
- (E) Spironolactone: While this is a potassium-sparing diuretic that can sometimes cause some fluid-related issues, it is typically used to manage fluid retention and would less commonly cause lower extremity swelling as a side effect.
- (A) Metoprolol: This beta-blocker does not usually cause peripheral edema as a side effect.
- (B) Verapamil: Although also a calcium channel blocker and can cause some peripheral edema, it is less commonly associated with it compared to dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers like Nifedipine.

In conclusion, the addition of Nifedipine explains the new onset lower extremity swelling in this patient.
 Agent 3 (👨🏿‍⚕️ pharmacologist) : In this case, the patient is a 45-year-old male with poorly controlled hypertension who develops new onset lower extremity swelling after an additional anti-hypertensive medication is added to his regimen. Among the options presented, certain medications are more likely to cause peripheral edema as a side effect.

Let's evaluate the options:

(A) **Metoprolol**: A beta-blocker that is not commonly associated with causing peripheral edema.

(B) **Verapamil**: A calcium channel blocker that can cause edema but is less frequently associated with significant peripheral swelling compared to dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers.

(C) **Nifedipine**: A dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker that is well-known for causing peripheral edema due to its vasodilatory effects, which lead to increased hydrostatic pressure in the capillaries.

(D) **Hydrochlorothiazide**: A thiazide diuretic used to treat hypertension, but it typically results in volume depletion and urine excretion, which would not cause lower extremity swelling.

(E) **Spironolactone**: An aldosterone antagonist used primarily in conditions like heart failure and resistant hypertension. It can cause hyperkalemia and breast tissue changes but is not commonly linked with peripheral edema as a primary side effect.

Considering these evaluations, the medication most likely prescribed that could lead to the patient's new onset lower extremity swelling is **(C) Nifedipine**.

[INFO] Step 4. Final Decision
👨‍⚖️  Moderator's final decision: {0.3: "Based on the consensus among the experts and the quality of their reasoning, the final decision is:\n\n**(C) Nifedipine**\n\nAll experts agreed that nifedipine, a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, is the most likely medication prescribed to the patient, as it is well-known to cause peripheral edema as a side effect. The other options were evaluated and found to be less likely to cause the new onset lower extremity swelling observed in the patient. Therefore, the addition of nifedipine explains the patient's symptoms effectively."}
