[INFO] Step 1. Expert Recruitment
[DEBUG] Recruited Experts and Hierarchy:
1. Cardiologist - Focuses on the diagnosis and treatment of heart and blood vessel-related conditions, including hyperlipidemia management. - Hierarchy: Independent  
2. Pharmacologist - Specializes in the mechanisms of drug action and can provide insight on the pharmacodynamics of niacin and related side effects. - Hierarchy: Independent  
3. Dermatologist - Focuses on skin conditions and can address the cutaneous side effects and their underlying mechanisms, including those relating to prostaglandin release. - Hierarchy: Independent  
Agent 1 (👨🏿‍⚕️ Cardiologist): Focuses on the diagnosis and treatment of heart and blood vessel-related conditions, including hyperlipidemia management.
Agent 2 (🧑🏽‍⚕️ Pharmacologist): Specializes in the mechanisms of drug action and can provide insight on the pharmacodynamics of niacin and related side effects.
Agent 3 (👩🏼‍⚕️ Dermatologist): Focuses on skin conditions and can address the cutaneous side effects and their underlying mechanisms, including those relating to prostaglandin release.

[INFO] Step 2. Initial Opinions
 Agent 1 (👨🏿‍⚕️ cardiologist) : The side effect the physician is trying to avoid by recommending aspirin alongside high-dose niacin (niacina) is likely due to the mechanism involving the release of prostaglandins. 

High-dose niacin is known to cause flushing and skin irritation, which is mediated by the release of prostaglandins. Aspirin can inhibit the production of prostaglandins by blocking cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, thereby reducing these side effects associated with niacin.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) Release of prostaglandins.
 Agent 2 (🧑🏽‍⚕️ pharmacologist) : The side effect that the physician is trying to avoid by recommending aspirin alongside high-dose niacin is most likely related to the (C) Release of prostaglandins. 

High doses of niacin can lead to flushing, a common side effect that is associated with the release of prostaglandins, which cause vasodilation and increased blood flow to the skin, resulting in the characteristic flushing and warmth. Aspirin is often used in this context because it inhibits the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzyme, which is responsible for the production of prostaglandins. By taking aspirin before niacin, the patient may experience less flushing and discomfort resulting from the prostaglandin-mediated response. 

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) Release of prostaglandins.
 Agent 3 (👩🏼‍⚕️ dermatologist) : The side effect that the physician is trying to avoid by prescribing aspirin along with high-dose niacin is primarily related to the release of prostaglandins. Niacin can cause flushing, which is due to vasodilation mediated by prostaglandins that are released in response to the medication. Aspirin can inhibit the production of prostaglandins by blocking cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, thereby reducing this flushing response.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(C) Release of prostaglandins.

[INFO] Step 4. Final Decision
👨‍⚖️  Moderator's final decision: {0.3: 'The consensus among the experts is clear, with all three specialists (cardiologist, pharmacologist, and dermatologist) agreeing that the side effect the physician is trying to avoid by recommending aspirin alongside high-dose niacin is related to the release of prostaglandins. They all provided similar reasoning, explaining that niacin can cause flushing due to vasodilation mediated by prostaglandins, and that aspirin helps mitigate this effect by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins.\n\nGiven the strong agreement and the quality of reasoning provided by the experts, the final answer to the question is:\n\n(C) Release of prostaglandins.'}
