[INFO] Step 2. Initial Opinions
 Agent 1 (👨‍⚕️ pediatrician) : Based on the clinical findings described, the 14-year-old boy is likely suffering from hereditary spherocytosis. The key indicators leading to this suspicion are:

1. The presence of indirect hyperbilirubinemia and reticulocytosis, both of which are common in conditions causing hemolysis.
2. The negative Coombs test indicates that the hemolysis is not due to autoimmune causes.
3. The osmotic fragility test showing increased fragility in a hypotonic solution supports the diagnosis of hereditary spherocytosis.

In hereditary spherocytosis, the red blood cells are abnormally shaped (spherocytes) due to a defect in the membrane proteins, which leads to increased fragility and premature destruction in the spleen.

Therefore, if a blood smear were obtained from this patient, the findings would most likely show:

(D) Spherocytes
 Agent 2 (👩🏻‍⚕️ hematologist) : The case described suggests a diagnosis of hereditary spherocytosis, which is characterized by increased osmotic fragility of the red blood cells due to defects in the red cell membrane proteins. The findings of a mild normocytic anemia with reticulocytosis, indirect hyperbilirubinemia, and a positive osmotic fragility test all support this diagnosis.

When examining the blood smear of a patient with hereditary spherocytosis, one would expect to see:

**(D) Spherocytes**

Spherocytes are small, round, and lack the central pallor that is typically seen in normal red blood cells, making them more fragile and susceptible to hemolysis. 

In summary, the anticipated findings on the blood smear for this 14-year-old boy, given the clinical context and lab findings, would be (D) Spherocytes.
 Agent 3 (🧑‍⚕️ gastroenterologist) : The clinical presentation and laboratory findings in this 14-year-old boy suggest that he has hereditary spherocytosis, a condition characterized by the presence of spherocytes due to defects in the red blood cell membrane. 

Key findings include:
- Mild normocytic anemia with reticulocytosis, which indicates a compensatory response to anemia.
- Indirect hyperbilirubinemia, consistent with hemolysis, and a negative Coombs test, which rules out autoimmune hemolytic anemia.
- Increased RDW suggests variability in red blood cell size, which can occur in hemolytic processes.
- Osmotic fragility test showing increased fragility in hypotonic solutions is characteristic of hereditary spherocytosis.

Given this information, the most anticipated finding on a blood smear for this patient would be (D) Spherocytes. These are smaller, spherical red blood cells that are less deformable and have a decreased surface area-to-volume ratio, commonly associated with conditions affecting the red blood cell membrane.

👨‍⚖️  Moderator's final decision: {0.3: 'Based on the consensus among the experts and the quality of their reasoning, the final answer to the question regarding the anticipated findings on a blood smear for the 14-year-old boy with suspected hereditary spherocytosis is:\n\n(D) Spherocytes. \n\nAll experts agree that the clinical findings and laboratory results point towards hereditary spherocytosis, which is characterized by the presence of spherocytes on a blood smear due to defects in the red blood cell membrane.'}
