[INFO] Final decision: {0.3: "Let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\nThe brother's symptoms (mild developmental delay, pale complexion, and dietary restriction of phenylalanine) are suggestive of phenylketonuria (PKU), which is an autosomal recessive disorder. In autosomal recessive inheritance, both parents must be carriers of the gene mutation for a child to be affected.\n\n1. Since the brother has PKU, he must have inherited one mutated allele from each parent.\n2. The parents are healthy, which suggests they are likely carriers of the PKU gene mutation (each carrying one normal allele and one mutated allele).\n3. The woman in question is the sister of the affected brother. For her to be a carrier, she must have inherited one of the alleles from one of her parents.\n\nNow, we can assess the probabilities:\n- Each parent has a 50% chance of passing on the mutated allele to their children.\n- Since the brother has PKU (and thus has two mutated alleles), the woman has a 2/3 chance of being a carrier because she could inherit either a normal allele or a mutated allele from each parent.\n\nThus, the most appropriate assessment of her carrier status for the disease affecting her brother is 67%.\n\nAnswer: (A) 67%"}
