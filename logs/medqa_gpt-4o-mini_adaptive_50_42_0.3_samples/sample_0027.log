[INFO] Final decision: {0.3: "Let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\nThe patient is a 39-year-old African-American woman with hip pain and a history of sarcoidosis. The pain is localized to the left hip and groin, has been progressively worsening, and there is no restriction of range of motion, which suggests that the hip joint itself may not be the primary issue. \n\nGiven her history of sarcoidosis, one possible concern is avascular necrosis (AVN) of the hip, which can occur due to corticosteroid use or other factors associated with sarcoidosis. The symptoms of hip pain, especially in the absence of significant physical findings, raise suspicion for this condition.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the imaging options provided:\n\n- (A) CT of the hip: Good for assessing bony structures but not the most sensitive for early detection of AVN.\n- (B) MRI of the hip: This is the most sensitive test for detecting early changes of avascular necrosis, including bone marrow edema and other subtle changes that are not visible on X-rays.\n- (C) Radiograph of the hip: This is often the first imaging study done but may miss early AVN changes.\n- (D) Radionuclide scan of the hip: Can be used to assess bone metabolism but is not as sensitive as MRI for AVN.\n- (E) Ultrasound of the hip: Useful for soft tissue evaluation but not the best for detecting AVN.\n\nConsidering all of this, the most sensitive test for detecting avascular necrosis in this patient would be:\n\n**Answer: (B) MRI of the hip**"}
