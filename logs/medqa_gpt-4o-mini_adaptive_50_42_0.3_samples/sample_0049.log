[INFO] Final decision: {0.3: "Let's analyze the situation step by step. The patient has type 1 diabetes and is experiencing symptoms consistent with hypoglycemia during the night, such as sweating, tremors, and weakness. These symptoms suggest that he may be having nocturnal hypoglycemic episodes, which can lead to increased blood glucose levels in the morning as a result of the body's counter-regulatory response.\n\nGiven that he is waking up with these symptoms and has high morning blood glucose levels, the most appropriate intervention would be to adjust his insulin regimen. Specifically, reducing the daily insulin dose may help prevent these nocturnal hypoglycemic episodes, thereby improving his overall blood glucose control and reducing the risk of hypoglycemia.\n\nTherefore, the optimal intervention for this patient's condition is:\n\nAnswer: (E) Reducing daily insulin dose"}
