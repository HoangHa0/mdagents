Question: Two days after being admitted for pneumonia, a 70-year-old man has repeated episodes of palpitations and nausea. He does not feel lightheaded and does not have chest pain. The patient appears mildly distressed. His pulse is 59/min and blood pressure is 110/60 mm Hg. Examination shows no abnormalities. Sputum cultures taken at the time of admission were positive for Mycoplasma pneumoniae. His magnesium is 2.0 mEq/L and his potassium is 3.7 mEq/L. An ECG taken during an episode of palpitations is shown. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? (A) Administration of metoprolol (D) Intermittent transvenous overdrive pacing (B) Administration of magnesium sulfate (C) Administration of amiodarone (E) Adminstration of potassium chloride
Reason: The most appropriate next step in the management of this patient is the administration of magnesium sulfate (B). Given the patient's episodes of palpitations and the fact that he is mildly distressed with a low pulse rate (bradycardia) but normal levels of potassium, one potential cause for the bradycardia and palpitations could be related to low magnesium levels, particularly since his magnesium level is at the low end of the normal range (normal is typically 1.5-2.5 mEq/L). Administering magnesium sulfate can help correct any magnesium deficiency, potentially alleviating the patient's symptoms and improving cardiac function.
Answer: (B) Administration of magnesium sulfate

Question: A 39-year-old male is rushed to the emergency department after he developed a sudden-onset severe headache with ensuing nausea, vomiting, vision changes, and loss of consciousness. Past medical history is unattainable. He reports that the headache is worse than any he has experienced before. Noncontrast CT of the head is significant for an intracranial hemorrhage. Follow-up cerebral angiography is performed and shows a ruptured anterior communicating artery aneurysm. Which of the following has the strongest association with this patient's current presentation? (A) History of multiple hemangioblastomas of the retina and spine as well as pheochromocytoma (E) History of renal transplantation at 8 years of age (D) Kidney ultrasound showing numerous bilateral renal cysts (C) Abdominal CT suggestive of renal cell carcinoma (B) Brain MRI showing a butterfly glioma with a central necrotic core
Reason: The strongest association with this patient’s current presentation of a ruptured anterior communicating artery aneurysm is a kidney ultrasound showing numerous bilateral renal cysts (D). This finding is strongly linked to Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD), a condition that is associated with an increased risk of intracranial aneurysms. Given that the patient has developed a severe headache and is found to have a ruptured aneurysm, the presence of renal cysts would suggest an underlying predisposition to vascular anomalies, including those affecting the brain.
Answer: (D) Kidney ultrasound showing numerous bilateral renal cysts

Question: A 32-year-old G1P0 woman at 27 weeks estimated gestational age presents for her first prenatal care appointment. She recently immigrated to the United States and didn’t receive any prenatal care in her country. Her blood pressure is 130/70 mm Hg, pulse is 85/min, and respirations are 16/min. Her BMI is 38.3 kg/m2. Physical examination is unremarkable except for normal pregnancy changes. Fetal ultrasound is performed and reveals fetal macrosomia. Which one of the following diagnostic tests is most likely to reveal the cause of this fetal abnormality? (A) Serum insulin (B) C-peptide (C) Oral glucose tolerance test (D) Glycated hemoglobin (E) Leptin
Reason: The diagnostic test most likely to reveal the cause of fetal macrosomia in this pregnant woman is the oral glucose tolerance test (C). Given her elevated BMI and the risk factors associated with gestational diabetes, this test will help assess her glucose metabolism and identify any abnormalities, such as gestational diabetes, which is a common cause of fetal macrosomia. Early detection of such conditions can lead to better management and outcomes for both mother and child.
Answer: (C) Oral glucose tolerance test

Let's analyze the case step by step.

1. **Patient Presentation**: The patient is a 21-year-old male who recently returned from a trip to Vietnam and Cambodia. He presents with fatigue, worsening headache, malaise, and pain in his hands and wrists. He also has a fever (102.5°F) and a maculopapular rash.

2. **Physical Exam Findings**: The patient has tenderness over his bilateral metacarpophalangeal joints, which suggests possible arthralgia or arthritis. The negative tourniquet test indicates that there is no significant bleeding tendency.

3. **Laboratory Results**:
   - Leukopenia (low white blood cell count: 3,200/mm^3)
   - Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count: 112,000/mm^3)
   - Elevated liver enzymes (AST: 106 U/L, ALT: 112 U/L)

4. **Epidemiological Context**: The patient has traveled to Southeast Asia, where several viral infections are endemic, including dengue fever and chikungunya.

5. **Differential Diagnosis**:
   - **Dengue Fever**: Common in Southeast Asia, presents with fever, headache, retro-orbital pain, myalgia, arthralgia, rash, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. The elevated liver enzymes also fit with dengue.
   - **Chikungunya**: Also presents with fever and severe joint pain, but typically has a more pronounced arthralgia component and may not always show significant thrombocytopenia.
   - **Hepatitis A**: Would typically present with jaundice and more significant liver enzyme elevation, and the travel history fits, but the joint pain is less characteristic.
   - **Epstein-Barr Virus**: Typically presents with fatigue, fever, and lymphadenopathy, not usually with significant thrombocytopenia or joint pain.
   - **Typhoid Fever**: Would present with prolonged fever, abdominal symptoms, and possibly rose spots, but not typically with joint pain and significant liver enzyme elevation.

Given the travel history, clinical presentation, and laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is **Dengue fever (B)**. 

**Answer: (B) Dengue fever**

Question: A 43-year-old Hispanic woman was admitted to the emergency room with intermittent sharp and dull pain in the right lower quadrant for the past 2 days. The patient denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or fever. She states that she was ‘completely normal’ prior to this sudden episode of pain. The patient states that she is sure she is not currently pregnant and notes that she has no children. Physical exam revealed guarding on palpation of the lower quadrants. An abdominal ultrasound revealed free abdominal fluid, as well as fluid in the gallbladder fossa. After further evaluation, the patient is considered a candidate for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The procedure and the risks of surgery are explained to her and she provides informed consent to undergo the cholecystectomy. During the procedure, the surgeon discovers a gastric mass suspicious for carcinoma. The surgeon considers taking a biopsy of the mass to determine whether or not she should resect the mass if it proves to be malignant. Which of the following is the most appropriate course of action to take with regards to taking a biopsy of the gastric mass? (C) The surgeon should obtain consent to biopsy the mass from the patient when she wakes up from cholecystectomy (B) The surgeon should resect the gastric mass (E) The surgeon should contact an attorney to obtain consent to biopsy the mass (A) The surgeon should biopsy the gastric mass (D) The surgeon should contact an ethics committee to obtain consent to biopsy the mass
Reason: The reasoning for choosing option (C) is grounded in the principle of informed consent. Since the patient was not informed or did not give consent for a gastric biopsy prior to surgery, it is ethically necessary to wait until she is awake and able to provide informed consent for this additional procedure, ensuring that her autonomy and rights as a patient are respected.
Answer: (C) The surgeon should obtain consent to biopsy the mass from the patient when she wakes up from cholecystectomy

Question: A 72-year-old man has been recently diagnosed with stage 3 squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity. After the necessary laboratory workup, concurrent chemoradiation therapy has been planned. Radiation therapy is planned to take place over 7 weeks and he will receive radiation doses daily, Monday–Friday, in 2.0 Gy fractions. For concurrent chemotherapy, he will receive intravenous cisplatin at a dosage of 50 mg/m2 weekly for 7 weeks. Which of the following best explains the mechanism of action of the antineoplastic drug that the patient will receive? (B) Inhibition of topoisomerase 2 (D) Inhibition of topoisomerase 1 (E) Free radical-mediated lipid peroxidation (A) Inhibition of polymerization of tubulin (C) Formation of interstrand DNA cross-links
Reason: The reasoning for selecting option (C) is based on the known mechanism of cisplatin, which is a platinum-based chemotherapy drug. Cisplatin works by forming interstrand DNA cross-links, which prevent DNA replication and transcription, ultimately leading to cell death, particularly in rapidly dividing cancer cells.
Answer: (C) Formation of interstrand DNA cross-links

Question: A 63-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-week history of fatigue and shortness of breath. Physical examination shows diminished breath sounds at the right lung base. An x-ray of the chest shows blunting of the right costophrenic angle. Thoracentesis shows clear, yellow-colored fluid with a protein concentration of 1.9 g/dL. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's pleural effusion? (B) Pulmonary sarcoidosis (A) Pulmonary tuberculosis (E) Bacterial pneumonia (C) Congestive heart failure (D) Thoracic duct injury
Reason: The reasoning for choosing option (C) is based on the patient's presentation and the characteristics of the pleural effusion. Congestive heart failure often leads to transudative pleural effusions due to increased hydrostatic pressure, resulting in fluid accumulation that is typically clear and yellow, matching the patient's thoracentesis results with a protein concentration that suggests a transudative process.
Answer: (C) Congestive heart failure

Let's analyze the information step by step.

1. **Patient Presentation**: The patient is a 56-year-old man with a history of hypertension, presenting with progressive fatigue and new onset muscle cramps. He is on hydrochlorothiazide, which is a diuretic that can lead to electrolyte imbalances.

2. **Vital Signs**: His blood pressure is significantly elevated at 174/111 mmHg, indicating poorly controlled hypertension.

3. **Laboratory Values**:
   - Sodium (Na+): 138 mEq/L (normal)
   - Chloride (Cl-): 100 mEq/L (normal)
   - Potassium (K+): 3.3 mEq/L (low, indicating hypokalemia)
   - Bicarbonate (HCO3-): 33 mEq/L (elevated, indicating metabolic alkalosis)
   - BUN: 20 mg/dL (slightly elevated)
   - Glucose: 129 mg/dL (elevated, indicating possible insulin resistance or diabetes)

4. **Key Findings**: The patient has hypokalemia (low potassium) and metabolic alkalosis. These findings are particularly suggestive of a condition associated with excess aldosterone, as aldosterone promotes sodium retention (leading to hypertension), potassium excretion (leading to hypokalemia), and hydrogen ion excretion (leading to metabolic alkalosis).

5. **Differential Diagnosis**:
   - **Aldosterone excess (Primary Hyperaldosteronism)**: This is characterized by hypertension, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis.
   - **Catecholamine-secreting mass (e.g., pheochromocytoma)**: Typically presents with paroxysmal hypertension and does not usually cause hypokalemia.
   - **Cortisol excess (Cushing's syndrome)**: Can cause hypertension and hypokalemia, but the metabolic alkalosis is less common.
   - **Impaired kidney perfusion**: This could lead to secondary hypertension but would not typically cause hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis.
   - **Increased peripheral vascular resistance**: This is a common cause of hypertension but does not explain the hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis.

Given the combination of hypertension, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis, the most likely underlying etiology of this patient's hypertension is:

**Answer: (A) Aldosterone excess**

Question: A 22-year-old man presents to clinic with a chief concern about a painless ulcer on his penis that he noticed 4 weeks ago and resolved one week ago. He denies any pain on urination or changes in urinary patterns. He admits to having multiple sexual partners in the past 3 months and inconsistent use of barrier protection. His vitals are within normal limits and his physical exam is unremarkable. He is given the appropriate antibiotic for this condition and sent home. What molecular structure is mimicked by the antibiotic most likely prescribed in this case? (C) Adenine (D) Folate intermediates (E) Retinoic acid (A) Uracil (B) D-Ala-D-Ala
Reason: The answer (B) D-Ala-D-Ala is likely because the clinical presentation of a painless ulcer on the penis, along with the patient's sexual history, raises suspicion for a sexually transmitted infection, specifically syphilis, which is often treated with antibiotics that mimic this structure. D-Ala-D-Ala is a peptidoglycan precursor that certain antibiotics, like vancomycin, target to disrupt bacterial cell wall synthesis, making it a plausible choice in this context.
Answer: (B) D-Ala-D-Ala

Question: A 23-year-old primigravid woman comes to the physician at 36 weeks' gestation for her first prenatal visit. She confirmed the pregnancy with a home urine pregnancy kit a few months ago but has not yet followed up with a physician. She takes no medications. Vital signs are within normal limits. Pelvic examination shows a uterus consistent in size with a 36-week gestation. Laboratory studies show:
Hemoglobin 10.6 g/dL
Serum
Glucose 88 mg/dL
Hepatitis B surface antigen negative
Hepatitis C antibody negative
HIV antibody positive
HIV load 11,000 copies/mL (N < 1000 copies/mL)
Ultrasonography shows an intrauterine fetus consistent in size with a 36-week gestation. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management of this patient?" (A) Intrapartum zidovudine and vaginal delivery when labor occurs (C) Start cART and prepare for vaginal delivery at 38 weeks' gestation (E) Conduct cesarean delivery immediately (B) Start cART and schedule cesarean delivery at 38 weeks' gestation (D) Intrapartum zidovudine and cesarean delivery at 38 weeks' gestation
Reason: The answer (B) Start cART and schedule cesarean delivery at 38 weeks' gestation is appropriate because the patient is HIV positive with a viral load greater than 1000 copies/mL, which poses a risk for vertical transmission during vaginal delivery. Initiating combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) is crucial to reduce the viral load, and scheduling a cesarean delivery at 38 weeks minimizes the risk of transmission during childbirth.
Answer: (B) Start cART and schedule cesarean delivery at 38 weeks' gestation

Question: A 29-year-old woman, gravida 1, para 1, comes to the physician for the evaluation of a painful mass in her left breast for several days. She has no fevers or chills. She has not noticed any changes in the right breast. She has no history of serious illness. Her last menstrual period was 3 weeks ago. She appears anxious. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 80/min, respirations are 13/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Examination shows a palpable, mobile, tender mass in the left upper quadrant of the breast. Ultrasound shows a 1.75-cm, well-circumscribed anechoic mass with posterior acoustic enhancement. The patient says that she is very concerned that she may have breast cancer and wishes further diagnostic testing. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient? (D) Excisional biopsy (A) Fine needle aspiration (C) MRI scan of the left breast (B) Mammogram (E) Core needle biopsy
Reason: The answer (A) Fine needle aspiration is appropriate because the ultrasound characteristics of the mass being described—specifically, its well-circumscribed, anechoic nature with posterior acoustic enhancement—are consistent with a simple cyst. Fine needle aspiration allows for both diagnosis and potential therapeutic relief if the mass is indeed a cyst, which is often the most appropriate initial step in managing palpable breast masses, especially in younger women.
Answer: (A) Fine needle aspiration

Question: A 33-year-old man presents to his primary care physician with shoulder pain. He states that he can't remember a specific instance when the injury occurred. He is a weight lifter and competes in martial arts. The patient has no past medical history and is currently taking a multivitamin. Physical exam demonstrates pain with abduction of the patient's right shoulder and with external rotation of the right arm. There is subacromial tenderness with palpation. His left arm demonstrates 10/10 strength with abduction as compared to 4/10 strength with abduction of the right arm. Which of the following best confirms the underlying diagnosis? (E) Ultrasound (C) Physical exam and history (D) Radiography (B) MRI (A) CT
Reason: The best choice to confirm the underlying diagnosis in this case of shoulder pain is (B) MRI. This imaging modality is particularly effective for assessing soft tissue structures, such as rotator cuff tears, which are common in weight lifters and athletes engaged in activities that require repetitive overhead motions. Given the patient's weakness and symptoms suggestive of a rotator cuff injury, MRI would provide detailed images to confirm any tears or abnormalities in the rotator cuff and other soft tissues.

Question: Two days after undergoing an emergency laparotomy following a motor vehicle collision, a 37-year-old man has increased thirst. Examination shows dry mucous membranes and decreased skin turgor. A review of his chart shows his urine output to be in excess of his fluid intake. Laboratory studies show a serum sodium concentration of 151 mEq/L and urine osmolality of 110 mOsmol/kg H2O. One hour after the administration of desmopressin, the serum sodium concentration is 146 mEq/L and urine osmolality is 400 mOsmol/kg H2O. One week later, his laboratory values are within normal limits. This patient's condition was most likely caused by damage to which of the following structures? (A) Posterior pituitary (D) Collecting duct (B) Adrenal cortex (C) Proximal renal tubule (E) Supraoptic nucleus
Reason: The most likely structure damaged in this patient's condition is the (A) Posterior pituitary. This conclusion is supported by the patient's initial symptoms of hypernatremia and polyuria, indicative of diabetes insipidus, which is characterized by inadequate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) from the posterior pituitary. The response to desmopressin, which stimulates the action of ADH on the kidneys, helped to normalize serum sodium and concentrate urine, further supporting the diagnosis of posterior pituitary dysfunction.

Question: A 58-year-old female comes to the physician because of generalized fatigue and malaise for 3 months. Four months ago, she was treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She has hypertension, asthma, chronic lower back pain, and chronic headaches. Current medications include hydrochlorothiazide, an albuterol inhaler, naproxen, and an aspirin-caffeine combination. Examination shows conjunctival pallor. Laboratory studies show:
Hemoglobin 8.9 g/dL
Serum
Urea nitrogen 46 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.4 mg/dL
Calcium 9.8 mg/dL
Urine
Protein 1+
Blood 1+
RBCs none
WBCs 9-10/hpf
Urine cultures are negative. Ultrasound shows shrunken kidneys with irregular contours and papillary calcifications. Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's renal failure?" (D) Infection with an acid-fast bacillus (B) Hypersensitivity reaction (A) Overproduction of light chains (C) Inhibition of prostaglandin I2 production (E) Precipitation of drugs within the renal tubules
Reason: The most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's renal failure is (C) Inhibition of prostaglandin I2 production. This is supported by the history of chronic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use, specifically naproxen, which can lead to decreased prostaglandin synthesis. Prostaglandins play a crucial role in maintaining renal blood flow, and their inhibition can lead to renal ischemia, particularly in patients with pre-existing renal impairment or conditions that predispose them to kidney injury, such as hypertension. The ultrasound findings of shrunken kidneys with irregular contours suggest chronic renal damage consistent with this mechanism.
Answer: (C) Inhibition of prostaglandin I2 production

Let's analyze the situation step by step.

The patient has developed a postoperative infection characterized by fever, purulent discharge, and the presence of gram-positive cocci in clusters. The organism is likely Staphylococcus aureus, which is known to cause such infections. The treatment with oral dicloxacillin, a penicillinase-resistant penicillin, is appropriate for treating infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus.

However, the patient continues to have high-grade fever and purulent discharge despite this treatment, indicating that the antibiotic is not effective. 

Now, let's evaluate the options:

- (A) Secretion of a pyrogenic toxin: While some bacteria can secrete toxins that cause fever, this does not explain the failure of the antibiotic treatment.
  
- (B) Presence of an impenetrable outer membrane: This is characteristic of gram-negative bacteria, not gram-positive cocci, so it does not apply here.

- (C) Ability to cleave β-lactam rings: This refers to the production of β-lactamase enzymes, which can inactivate β-lactam antibiotics like penicillins. Staphylococcus aureus can produce such enzymes, leading to resistance against dicloxacillin.

- (D) Development of efflux pumps: This mechanism is more common in gram-negative bacteria and is not typically associated with Staphylococcus aureus.

- (E) Adaptation in binding proteins: This could refer to changes in penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) that confer resistance, but it is less common than β-lactamase production in Staphylococcus aureus.

Given the context of the infection and the antibiotic used, the most likely explanation for the failure to improve with dicloxacillin is (C) Ability to cleave β-lactam rings, as this indicates the presence of β-lactamase, which would render the antibiotic ineffective.

**Answer: (C) Ability to cleave β-lactam rings**

Question: A 63-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department because of severe abdominal pain and vomiting for 3 hours. She had previous episodes of abdominal pain that lasted for 10–15 minutes and resolved with antacids. She lives with her daughter and grandchildren. She divorced her husband last year. She is alert and oriented. Her temperature is 37.3°C (99.1°F), pulse is 134/min, and blood pressure is 90/70 mm Hg. The abdomen is rigid and diffusely tender. Guarding and rebound tenderness are present. Rectal examination shows a collapsed rectum. Infusion of 0.9% saline is begun and a CT of the abdomen shows intestinal perforation. The surgeon discusses the need for emergent exploratory laparotomy with the patient and she agrees to it. Written informed consent is obtained. While in the holding area awaiting emergent transport to the operating room, she calls for the surgeon and informs him that she no longer wants the surgery. He explains the risks of not performing the surgery to her and she indicates she understands but is adamant about not proceeding with surgery. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? (C) Continue with emergency life-saving surgery (E) Obtain consent from the patient's ex-husband (B) Cancel the surgery (D) Obtain consent from the patient's daughter (A) Consult hospital ethics committee
Reason: In this scenario, the patient has the right to refuse medical treatment, including surgery, even after previously consenting to it. As she has demonstrated an understanding of the risks and has made an informed decision to decline surgery, the most appropriate next step is to respect her autonomy and cancel the surgery (option B).

Question: A 40-year-old man with a history of type I diabetes presents to the emergency room in respiratory distress. His respirations are labored and deep, and his breath odor is notably fruity. Which of the following laboratory results would you most expect to find in this patient? (E) Increased urine H2PO4- (A) Increased serum HCO3- (D) Increased urine HCO3- (B) Decreased serum H+ (C) Decreased urine H+
Reason: In a case of respiratory distress with fruity breath odor, the symptoms are suggestive of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), which typically leads to metabolic acidosis. In DKA, the kidneys excrete excess hydrogen ions to help partially compensate for the acidosis, which can result in an increased phosphate (H2PO4-) excretion as the body attempts to manage the associated acidosis, making option (E) the expected laboratory finding.
Answer: (E) Increased urine H2PO4-

Question: A 55-year-old black male otherwise healthy presents for a yearly physical. No significant past medical history. Current medications are a multivitamin and rosuvastatin 20 mg orally daily. Vitals are temperature 37°C (98.6°F), blood pressure 155/75 mm Hg, pulse 95/min, respirations 16/min, and oxygen saturation 99% on room air. On physical examination, the patient is alert and cooperative. The cardiac exam is significant for a high-pitched diastolic murmur loudest at the left sternal border. Peripheral pulses are bounding and prominent followed by a quick collapse on palpation. Lungs are clear to auscultation. The abdomen is soft and nontender. Chest X-ray is normal. ECG is significant for left axis deviation and broad bifid P-waves in lead II. Transthoracic echocardiography shows a bicuspid aortic valve, severe aortic regurgitation, left atrial enlargement and left ventricular dilatation and hypertrophy. Left ventricular ejection fraction is 45%. Which of the following is the best course of treatment for this patient? (D) Administer dobutamine and nitroprusside (C) Outpatient management on enalapril 10 mg orally twice daily (A) Reassurance and recommend long-term follow-up with outpatient cardiology for clinical surveillance with regular echocardiography (E) Admit to hospital for aortic valve replacement (B) Outpatient management on nifedipine 45 mg orally daily
Reason: In this case, the patient presents with severe aortic regurgitation, as indicated by the diastolic murmur, left ventricular dilatation and hypertrophy, and a significantly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (45%). Given the severity of his condition, which includes heart failure due to the aortic regurgitation, the best course of action is to admit him to the hospital for aortic valve replacement (option E) to prevent further cardiac decline and potential complications.

Let's analyze the case step by step. The patient has a history of liver cirrhosis and alcoholism, presents with confusion, asterixis, and guaiac-positive stools, indicating possible gastrointestinal bleeding. The symptoms and findings suggest hepatic encephalopathy, which is a complication of liver disease.

Now, let's evaluate the options:

(A) It carries a good prognosis - This is incorrect. Hepatic encephalopathy can have a variable prognosis depending on the underlying liver function and the presence of precipitating factors.

(B) Ammonia level is the best initial test to confirm the diagnosis - While elevated ammonia levels can be associated with hepatic encephalopathy, they are not the best initial test for diagnosis, as ammonia levels can be normal in some cases.

(C) It is a diagnosis of exclusion - This is partially true, as other causes of confusion should be ruled out, but it is not the best answer in this context.

(D) It only occurs in patients with cirrhosis - This is incorrect. Hepatic encephalopathy can occur in patients with acute liver failure or other liver dysfunctions, not just cirrhosis.

(E) Electroencephalography (EEG) usually shows focal localizing abnormality - This is incorrect. EEG in hepatic encephalopathy typically shows generalized slowing rather than focal abnormalities.

Given the analysis, the best answer is (C) It is a diagnosis of exclusion, as hepatic encephalopathy is often diagnosed after ruling out other potential causes of altered mental status.

Question: A 25-year-old female with a history of childhood asthma presents to clinic complaining of a three month history of frequent, loose stools. She currently has three to four bowel movements per day, and she believes that these episodes have been getting worse and are associated with mild abdominal pain. She also endorses seeing red blood on the toilet tissue. On further questioning, she also endorses occasional palpitations over the past few months. She denies fevers, chills, headache, blurry vision, cough, shortness of breath, wheezing, nausea, or vomiting. She describes her mood as slightly irritable and she has been sleeping poorly. A review of her medical chart reveals a six pound weight loss since her visit six months ago, but she says her appetite has been normal. The patient denies any recent illness or travel. She is a non-smoker. Her only current medication is an oral contraceptive pill.

Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 104/min, blood pressure is 95/65 mmHg, respirations are 16/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. On physical exam, the physician notes that her thyroid gland appears symmetrically enlarged but is non-tender to palpation. Upon auscultation there is an audible thyroid bruit. Her cranial nerve is normal and ocular exam reveals exophthalmos. Her abdomen is soft and non-tender to palpation. Deep tendon reflexes are 3+ throughout. Lab results are as follows:

He started walking at the age of 11 months and can speak in two-to-three-word phrases. He often mispronounces words. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? (E) Conduct disorder (A) Selective mutism (D) Specific-learning disorder (C) Autistic spectrum disorder (B) Hearing impairment
Reason: The most likely diagnosis is hearing impairment because the child's behavior, including not responding when called and not following instructions, suggests a potential inability to hear or process auditory information. His ability to participate in group activities and cheerful demeanor indicate that he likely has social skills intact, which aligns more with a communication issue rather than a neurodevelopmental disorder like autism or selective mutism.
Answer: (B) Hearing impairment

Question: A 24-year-old man presents with a painless genital ulcer for the past 2 weeks. He reports that he recently has been having unprotected sex with multiple partners. Past medical history is unremarkable. On physical examination, a single ulcer is present on the dorsal shaft of the penis which is circumscribed, indurated, and partially healed. There is moderate inguinal lymphadenopathy but no buboes. Which of the following tests would confirm the most likely diagnosis in this patient? (E) Perform a darkfield microscopic examination of a swab from the chancre (D) Frei test (C) Fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) test (B) Swab the chancre and perform a saline wet mount (A) Viral and rickettsial disease research laboratory (VDRL) test
Reason: The most likely diagnosis for this patient is primary syphilis, as indicated by the presence of a painless genital ulcer (chancre) and inguinal lymphadenopathy. To confirm this diagnosis, the Fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) test is appropriate because it specifically detects antibodies to Treponema pallidum, the causative agent of syphilis, and is considered one of the confirmatory tests after a positive non-treponemal test.
Answer: (C) Fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) test

Let's analyze the case step by step. 

The patient is a 30-year-old man presenting with excessive fatigue, weakness, abdominal pain, constipation, and significant weight loss. He also has a notable bronze discoloration of the skin, which is characteristic of hemochromatosis or adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease). The low blood pressure and bradycardia (pulse of 63/min) could suggest adrenal insufficiency as well.

Given the symptoms and the physical exam findings, this patient likely has primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease), which can present with fatigue, weight loss, abdominal pain, and hyperpigmentation of the skin due to increased ACTH levels.

In cases of suspected adrenal crisis or significant adrenal insufficiency, the immediate management is to administer intravenous hydrocortisone to provide the necessary glucocorticoids.

Therefore, the next best step in the management of this patient is:

**Answer: (A) Administer intravenous hydrocortisone.**

Question: A 45-year-old man comes to the clinic complaining of yellow skin and eyes, loss of appetite, and severe nausea over the last month or so. He drinks 2–3 beers everyday and about 5–6 on the weekend. He does not take any over-the-counter medications. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes every day for the last 20 years but does not use illicit drugs. Additionally, he reports no history of vomiting, abdominal pain, altered bowel habits, or unintentional weight loss. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), blood pressure is 135/85 mm Hg, pulse is 78/ min, respiratory rate is 14/ min, and BMI is 19 kg/m2. On physical examination his skin and sclera are icteric, and his abdomen is tender with a mildly enlarged liver. On laboratory investigations:
Complete blood count
Hemoglobin 11 g/dL
MCV 105 µm3
White blood cell 14,000/mm3
Platelets 110,000/mm3
Which of the following liver function analyses is expected in this patient? (A) Alanine aminotransferase (ALT): 38/ Aspartate aminotransferase (AST): 30 / AST/ALT: 0.79 (E) Alanine aminotransferase (ALT): 2,521 / Aspartate aminotransferase (AST): 2,222 / AST/ALT: 0.88 (D) Alanine aminotransferase (ALT): 83 / Aspartate aminotransferase (AST): 72 / AST/ALT: 0.87 (B) Alanine aminotransferase (ALT): 1,500 / Aspartate aminotransferase (AST): 1,089 / AST/ALT: 0.73 (C) Alanine aminotransferase (ALT): 120 / Aspartate aminotransferase (AST): 256 / AST/ALT: 2.1
Reason: The expected liver function analyses for this patient align with the mechanism of liver damage typically seen in alcohol-related liver disease. Given the patient's regular alcohol consumption and symptoms consistent with liver dysfunction, an elevated AST/ALT ratio greater than 2.0 suggests alcoholic hepatitis, which is consistent with option (C). Additionally, the elevated mean corpuscular volume (MCV) indicates macrocytic anemia, often seen in chronic alcohol use, further supporting the connection to alcohol-induced liver pathology.

Question: A 57-year-old man comes to the physician two weeks after a blood pressure of 160/92 mm Hg was measured at a routine health maintenance examination. Subsequent home blood pressure measurements since the last visit have been: 159/98 mm Hg, 161/102 mm Hg, and 152/95 mm Hg. Over the past 3 years, the patient has had a 10-kg (22-lb) weight gain. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus. He does not follow any specific diet; he usually eats sandwiches at work and fried chicken or burger for dinner. He says that he has been struggling with a stressful project at work recently. His mother was diagnosed with hypertension at the age of 45. The patient's only medication is metformin. His pulse is 82/min, and blood pressure now is 158/98 mm Hg. The patient is 178 cm (5 ft 10 in) tall and weighs 133 kg (293 lb); BMI is 42 kg/m2. Physical examination shows no other abnormalities except for significant central obesity. Fasting serum studies show:
Total cholesterol 220 mg/dL
HDL-cholesterol 25 mg/dL

Question: A 24-year-old man presents to his primary care physician for a persistent and low grade headache as well as trouble focusing. The patient was seen in the emergency department 3 days ago after hitting his head on a branch while biking under the influence of alcohol. His head CT at the time was normal, and the patient was sent home with follow up instructions. Since the event, he has experienced trouble focusing on his school work and feels confused at times while listening to lectures. He states that he can’t remember the lectures and also says he has experienced a sensation of vertigo at times. On review of systems, he states that he has felt depressed lately and has had trouble sleeping, though he denies any suicidal or homicidal ideation. His temperature is 98.2°F (36.8°C), blood pressure is 122/65 mmHg, pulse is 70/min, respirations are 12/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. The patient’s neurological and cardiopulmonary exam are within normal limits. Which of the following is the best next step in management? (D) Rest and primary care follow up (E) Thiamine (B) CT scan of the head without contrast (A) Cognitive behavioral therapy (C) Fluoxetine
Reason: The best next step in management for this patient, given his symptoms of persistent headache, difficulty focusing, and feeling confused after a recent head trauma, is to recommend rest and arrange for primary care follow-up. This approach is appropriate as the patient's head CT was normal, indicating no significant structural injury, and rest can help alleviate post-concussion symptoms while monitoring for any worsening or new issues that may arise. Additionally, if symptoms persist or worsen, further evaluation or intervention can be considered during follow-up.
Answer: (D) Rest and primary care follow up

Let's analyze the information step by step.

1. **Patient Profile**: The patient is a 58-year-old man with a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He is a smoker and has worked as a fruit picker, which may expose him to sun and other environmental factors.

2. **Symptoms**: He presents with a painless lesion on his lower lip that has been present for 3 months. The lesion is described as a single ulcer near the vermillion border.

3. **Differential Diagnosis**:
   - **Herpes labialis (B)**: Typically presents as painful vesicular lesions, not usually as a single painless ulcer.
   - **Squamous cell carcinoma (A)**: Commonly presents as a non-healing ulcer or lesion, especially in smokers and those with sun exposure. The location and characteristics fit this diagnosis.
   - **Aphthous stomatitis (C)**: Usually presents as painful ulcers and is not typically found on the vermillion border.
   - **Traumatic ulcer (E)**: Would usually have a history of trauma or irritation, and these are often painful.
   - **Actinic keratosis (D)**: Typically presents as a scaly patch rather than an ulcer, and while it can occur on sun-exposed areas, it does not fit the description of a single ulcer.

4. **Conclusion**: Given the patient's age, smoking history, and the characteristics of the lesion (painless, persistent for 3 months, located on the lip), the most likely diagnosis is **squamous cell carcinoma**.

Question: A 38-year-old man presents to the emergency department due to severe alcohol intoxication. The patient is agitated and refuses to answer any questions in regards to his medical history. The vital signs are within normal limits. The complete blood count results demonstrate hemoglobin of 11.5 g/dL, hematocrit of 39%, and mean corpuscular volume of 77 μm3. Using a special dye, the histology demonstrates blue-colored rings in the peripheral smear. What are the most likely findings on the ferritin, total iron-binding capacity, and serum iron levels? (C) Ferritin: ↑, total iron-binding capacity: ↓, serum iron: ↑ (E) Ferritin: ↓, total iron-binding capacity: ↑, serum iron: ↓ (A) Ferritin: ↓, total iron-binding capacity: ↓, serum iron: ↓ (D) Ferritin: ↑, total iron-binding capacity: ↓, serum iron: ↓ (B) Ferritin: normal, total iron binding capacity: normal, serum iron: normal
Reason: The answer is supported by the presence of blue-colored rings on the peripheral smear, which is indicative of sideroblastic anemia. In this condition, there is often an accumulation of iron in the marrow due to ineffective erythropoiesis, leading to an increase in ferritin levels since the iron cannot be used properly for hemoglobin synthesis. Consequently, total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) decreases because the body senses the excess iron and reduces the production of transferrin, while serum iron can be elevated due to the iron overload.
Answer: (C) Ferritin: ↑, total iron-binding capacity: ↓, serum iron: ↑

Question: One day after undergoing surgery for a traumatic right pelvic fracture, a 73-year-old man has pain over his buttocks and scrotum and urinary incontinence. Physical examination shows right-sided perineal hypesthesia and absence of anal sphincter contraction when the skin around the anus is touched. This patient is most likely to have which of the following additional neurological deficits? (D) Impaired psychogenic erection (A) Paralysis of hip adductors (E) Absent cremasteric reflex (B) Absent reflex erection (C) Impaired hip flexion
Reason: The answer is supported by the presence of urinary incontinence and perineal hypesthesia, which suggest involvement of the sacral nerves (S2-S4) that control both bladder function and erectile function. Injuries or damage to these sacral nerve roots can impair the reflex erection mechanism, leading to absent reflex erection in this patient.
Answer: (B) Absent reflex erection

Question: A 48-year-old man comes to the physician for evaluation of an intensely pruritic skin rash on his arms and legs for 12 hours. Two days ago, he returned from an annual camping trip with his son. The patient takes no medications. A photograph of the skin lesions on his left hand is shown. Activation of which of the following cell types is the most likely cause of this patient's skin findings? (C) B cells (B) Neutrophils (A) T cells (D) Mast cells (E) Eosinophils
"
Reason: The answer is supported by the acute pruritic skin rash that developed shortly after the patient's camping trip, which suggests a type IV hypersensitivity reaction, commonly associated with contact dermatitis from allergens like plants (e.g., poison ivy). In this scenario, T cells, particularly sensitized CD4+ T helper cells, play a crucial role in mediating the immune response leading to the skin findings through their activation and recruitment to the site of exposure.
Answer: (A) T cells

Let's analyze the case step by step.

The patient is a 46-year-old woman presenting with severe muscle and joint pain, joint stiffness, fatigue, and tingling sensations in her lower limbs. The symptoms have been ongoing for 5 months, and she has a normal examination with symmetric muscular tenderness but normal strength and deep tendon reflexes. The laboratory results show normal blood counts, normal ESR, and normal metabolic panel, which suggests that there is no significant inflammatory or hematological disorder.

Given her symptoms, particularly the muscle and joint pain, along with the fatigue and tingling sensations, this presentation is suggestive of fibromyalgia. Fibromyalgia is characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, and often associated with sleep disturbances and mood disorders.

The treatment options provided include:

- (D) Amitriptyline: This is a tricyclic antidepressant that is often used to help manage fibromyalgia symptoms, particularly pain and sleep disturbances.
- (B) Temazepam: This is a benzodiazepine used for sleep disorders but is not typically a first-line treatment for fibromyalgia.
- (E) Methotrexate: This is used for inflammatory conditions like rheumatoid arthritis but is not indicated for fibromyalgia.
- (C) Vitamin B12: This is not a treatment for fibromyalgia.
- (A) Bupropion: This is an antidepressant that is not typically used for fibromyalgia.

Considering the most appropriate therapy for fibromyalgia, the best choice is:

**Answer: (D) Amitriptyline**

Question: Five sets of PCR primers were designed and sythesized, one for each of the viruses listed below. The viral genomic material from each virus was extracted and added to a PCR reaction containing a DNA-dependent Taq polymerase with the corresponding primers. However, of the five PCR reactions, only one yielded an amplified product as detected by gel agarose. From which of the following viruses did the PCR product arise? (E) Yellow Fever virus (C) Adenovirus (B) Rhinovirus (D) Rubella virus (A) Poliovirus
Reason: The reason the PCR product arose from the Adenovirus could be attributed to the specific binding and amplification of the primers designed for that virus, which suggests that the primers were well-matched to the adenoviral genomic material. If only one reaction yielded a product, it indicates that the other viruses did not have the corresponding sequence recognized by their primers, leading to no amplification.

Question: A 5-year-old girl presents for a routine checkup. The patient’s parents say she has been looking pale and tired lately. Her family history is unremarkable. Upon physical examination, several bruises are seen, as well as petechial bleeding on her limbs. A complete blood count shows leukocytosis with severe anemia and thrombocytopenia. A peripheral blood smear shows 35% blasts. Ultrasonography of the abdomen shows hepatosplenomegaly and a chest radiograph reveals a mediastinal mass. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient? (E) Chronic myeloid leukemia (D) Aplastic anemia (B) Acute myeloid leukemia (C) Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (A) Acute lymphoblastic leukemia
Reason: The symptoms and findings in this 5-year-old girl, including severe anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukocytosis with high percentages of blasts, and the presence of hepatosplenomegaly and a mediastinal mass, are characteristic of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). The predominance of blasts in a child, along with the systemic symptoms, suggests a malignancy of lymphoid lineage, which aligns with the diagnosis of ALL.

Question: A 15-year-old boy is brought to the clinic by his father for complaints of “constant irritation.” His father explains that ever since his divorce with the son’s mother last year he has noticed increased irritability in his son. "He has been skipping out on his baseball practices which he has always enjoyed,” his dad complains. After asking the father to step out, the patient reports trouble concentrating at school and has been staying up late “just thinking about stuff.” When probed further, he states that he “feels responsible for his parents' divorce because he was being rebellious.” What is the best treatment for this patient at this time? (B) Escitalopram (E) Venlafaxine (A) Buspirone (D) Methylphenidate (C) Quetiapine
Reason: The best treatment for this 15-year-old boy is likely Escitalopram, as it is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) commonly used to treat symptoms of depression and anxiety in adolescents. Given the patient’s reported feelings of irritability, trouble concentrating, and excessive worry about his parents' divorce, Escitalopram can help address the underlying depressive and anxiety symptoms he is experiencing, promoting better mood regulation and focus.

Let's analyze the case step by step. The patient has a left C5 hemicord lesion, which suggests a Brown-Séquard syndrome, characterized by hemisection of the spinal cord. 

1. **Left-sided weakness**: This indicates involvement of the corticospinal tract on the left side, leading to motor deficits on the same side as the lesion.
2. **Sensory findings**: In Brown-Séquard syndrome, there is typically:
   - Ipsilateral loss of motor function (due to corticospinal tract involvement).
   - Ipsilateral loss of proprioception and vibration sense (due to dorsal column involvement).
   - Contralateral loss of pain and temperature sensation (due to spinothalamic tract involvement).

Given these points, the most likely additional finding in this patient would be:

- **Contralateral loss of pain and temperature sensation** (which corresponds to the loss of analgesia on the right side due to the crossing of the spinothalamic tract fibers).

Thus, the correct answer is:

**(D) Right-sided analgesia**.

Question: A 5-day-old male is brought to your office by his mother. The infant is experiencing bilious vomiting, abdominal distension, and overall failure to thrive. A contrast enema shows a transition point at the transverse colon between dilated ascending colon and non-distended distal portion of the colon. Which of the following is the most likely etiology of this patient's disease? (A) Muscle hypertrophy (C) CFTR gene mutation (D) Meiotic nondisjunction (B) Mechanical bowel obstruction (E) Failure of neural crest cell migration
Reason: The presentation of bilious vomiting, abdominal distension, and failure to thrive in a 5-day-old infant suggests a gastrointestinal obstruction, particularly in the context of a transition point seen on the contrast enema. The specific findings indicate that there is a failure of the nerve cells to migrate properly during embryonic development, leading to conditions like Hirschsprung's disease, which is characterized by an absence of ganglion cells in the distal colon. Therefore, (E) Failure of neural crest cell migration is the most likely etiology, as it directly relates to the developmental issue causing the obstruction.

Question: A 64-year-old woman otherwise healthy presents with acute onset severe rectal bleeding. The patient says that 2 hours ago bleeding began suddenly after a difficult bowel movement. She says the blood is bright red, and, initially, bleeding was brisk but now has stopped. The patient denies having any similar symptoms in the past. She has noticed that she bled more easily while having her regular manicure/pedicure for the past 3 months but thought it was nothing serious. No significant past medical history and the patient does not take any current medications. Family history is unremarkable. Review of systems is positive for mild dyspnea on exertion the past 2-3 months. Her vital signs include: temperature 37.0°C (98.6°F), blood pressure 100/65 mm Hg, pulse 95/min, respiratory rate 15/min, and oxygen saturation 97% on room air. A cardiac examination is significant for a 2/6 systolic murmur loudest at the right upper sternal border. Rectal exam shows no evidence of external hemorrhoids, fissures, or lesions. No active bleeding is noted. The stool is guaiac positive. Deficiency of which of the following is most likely the cause of this patient’s condition? (A) Vitamin K (C) von Willebrand factor (B) Antithrombin III (E) ADAMST13 gene mutation (D) Factor VIII
Reason: The patient’s acute onset of severe rectal bleeding, along with a history of easy bruising during manicures, suggests a bleeding disorder. The presence of guaiac-positive stool further indicates a bleeding source, and the combination of these symptoms might suggest a deficiency in von Willebrand factor (C), which plays a crucial role in platelet adhesion and function. This deficiency could lead to an increased tendency to bleed, especially in situations of increased stress on the vascular system, such as during bowel movements.

Question: While walking through a park with his wife, a 51-year-old man with type 2 diabetes mellitus develops nausea, sweating, pallor, and palpitations. For the past 3 weeks, he has been trying to lose weight and has adjusted his diet and activity level. He eats a low-carb diet and swims 3 times a week. The man returned home from a training session 2 hours ago. Current medications include basal insulin and metformin. Shortly before his wife returns from their car with his emergency medication kit, he becomes unconscious. Administration of which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? (B) Oral glucose (A) Sublingual nitroglycerine (C) Intramuscular glucagon (E) Intra-arterial dextrose (D) Rectal lorazepam
Reason: The patient exhibits symptoms consistent with hypoglycemia, including nausea, sweating, pallor, and palpitations, and he has a history of diabetes managed with insulin. Given his loss of consciousness and the need for immediate action to raise blood glucose levels, administering intramuscular glucagon (C) is the most appropriate next step, as it can quickly mobilize glycogen stores to increase blood sugar in unconscious patients. While oral glucose would be ideal, the patient's unconscious state makes it unsafe and ineffective in this scenario.
Answer: (C) Intramuscular glucagon

Let's analyze the question step by step. The patient is exhibiting symptoms consistent with a manic episode, possibly indicative of bipolar disorder or a similar mood disorder. The key points to consider for prognosis in such conditions include the nature of the symptoms, the duration of the episode, and the patient's background.

1. **Male sex (D)**: Generally, sex does not significantly influence the prognosis of mood disorders.
2. **Negative symptoms (E)**: Negative symptoms (such as flat affect, lack of motivation) are often associated with poorer prognosis in psychotic disorders.
3. **Being single (C)**: Being single can sometimes correlate with poorer social support, which may negatively impact prognosis.
4. **Affective symptoms (A)**: The presence of affective symptoms (such as mood disturbances) can indicate a better prognosis, especially if they are prominent in the clinical picture.
5. **Slow onset (B)**: A slow onset of symptoms is often associated with a poorer prognosis in mood disorders.

Given these considerations, the presence of **affective symptoms (A)** is generally associated with a better prognosis in mood disorders, as it suggests that the mood component is significant and may respond well to treatment.

Therefore, the answer is: **(A) Affective symptoms**.

Question: A 23-year-old primigravida pregnant patient is in her 3rd trimester with twins. She complains of itching and skin lesions. The examination shows vesicular skin lesions on the abdomen but not on the face, palms, or soles. A picture of her abdomen is shown in the image. Her past medical history is insignificant. Her vital signs are all within normal limits. What is the next best step in management? (B) Begin weekly antepartum testing to ensure fetal well-being (E) Start treatment with an antihistamine (D) Reassure her and provide symptomatic relief with topical steroids (C) Biopsy the lesions to ensure proper diagnosis (A) Begin treatment with systemic oral corticosteroids
Reason: In this scenario, the presentation of vesicular skin lesions on the abdomen of a pregnant patient in her third trimester is indicative of a condition commonly known as pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy (PUPPP). This condition is typically managed with reassurance and symptomatic relief, as the lesions often resolve spontaneously after delivery. Therefore, providing topical steroids for symptomatic relief is the most appropriate next step in management.

Question: A 35-year-old woman is admitted to the medical unit for worsening renal failure. Prior to admission, she was seen by her rheumatologist for a follow-up visit and was found to have significant proteinuria and hematuria on urinalysis and an elevated serum creatinine. She reports feeling ill and has noticed blood in her urine. She was diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus at the age of 22, and she is currently being treated with ibuprofen for joint pain and prednisone for acute flare-ups. Her blood pressure is 165/105 mmHg. Laboratory testing is remarkable for hypocomplementemia and an elevated anti-DNA antibody. A renal biopsy is performed, which demonstrates 65% glomerular involvement along with the affected glomeruli demonstrating endocapillary and extracapillary glomerulonephritis. In addition to glucocorticoid therapy, the medical team will add mycophenolate mofetil to her treatment regimen. Which of the following is the mechanism of action of mycophenolate mofetil? (B) Calcineurin inhibitor via FKBP binding (A) Calcineurin inhibitor via cyclophilin binding (D) Interleukin-2 receptor complex inhibitor (E) mTOR inhibitor via FKBP binding (C) Inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase inhibitor
Reason: Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) acts as an inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), which is a crucial enzyme in the de novo pathway of purine synthesis. By inhibiting this enzyme, MMF selectively suppresses lymphocyte proliferation, particularly affecting T and B cells, thus contributing to its immunosuppressive effects in conditions like systemic lupus erythematosus and post-transplantation management.

Question: A 55-year-old man presents to the emergency department with nausea and vomiting. The patient states that he has felt nauseous for the past week and began vomiting last night. He thought his symptoms would resolve but decided to come in when his symptoms worsened. He feels that his symptoms are exacerbated with large fatty meals and when he drinks alcohol. His wife recently returned from a cruise with symptoms of vomiting and diarrhea. The patient has a past medical history of poorly managed diabetes, constipation, anxiety, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. His temperature is 99.5°F (37.5°C), blood pressure is 197/128 mmHg, pulse is 100/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 95% on room air. Physical exam reveals a systolic murmur heard loudest along the left upper sternal border. Abdominal exam reveals an obese, tympanitic and distended abdomen with a 3 cm scar in the right lower quadrant. Vascular exam reveals weak pulses in the lower extremities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? (B) Enteric nervous system damage (A) Adhesions (E) Twisting of the bowel (D) Norovirus (C) Impacted stool
Reason: In this case, the patient's symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and an abdomen that is distended and tympanitic, along with a history of previous abdominal surgery indicated by the scar in the right lower quadrant, suggest the presence of bowel obstruction. Adhesions, which are bands of fibrous tissue that can form after surgery, commonly cause such obstructions, particularly when patients present with symptoms following fatty meals or alcohol consumption, which might precipitate nausea or vomiting due to the impaired gastrointestinal function.
Answer: (A) Adhesions
[INFO] CoT response generated.
Let's analyze the situation step by step. 

The patient is a 26-year-old man who has been involved in a motor vehicle accident and presents with signs of significant abdominal trauma. His vital signs indicate hypotension (BP 82/50 mmHg) and tachycardia (HR 180 bpm), which suggest he is likely in shock. The physical exam findings of abdominal wall rigidity, involuntary guarding, and tenderness indicate possible peritonitis, and the bedside sonography shows hemoperitoneum, which is concerning for intra-abdominal bleeding.

Given the patient's unstable vital signs and the evidence of hemoperitoneum, the best next step in management is to address the potential source of bleeding and the need for surgical intervention. While fluid resuscitation is important, the patient's ongoing hypotension despite fluid administration indicates that he may require surgical intervention rather than further conservative management.

Therefore, the best next step is:

**Answer: (E) Exploratory laparotomy** 

This is necessary to evaluate and manage the source of the bleeding and any potential intra-abdominal injuries.

Question: A 42-year-old woman comes to her primary care physician because of an irritating sensation in her nose. She noticed recently that there seems to be a lump in her nose. Her past medical history is significant for pain that seems to migrate around her body and is refractory to treatment. She has intermittently been taking a medication for the pain and recently increased the dose of the drug. Which of the following processes was most likely responsible for development of this patient's complaint? (E) Increased mucous viscosity (B) Decreased prostaglandin activity (A) Decreased lipoxygenase pathway activity (C) Increased allergic reaction in mucosa (D) Increased lipoxygenase pathway activity
Reason: The correct answer is (D) Increased lipoxygenase pathway activity. This is supported by the patient's history of pain that migrates and her use of a pain medication, which may indicate an inflammatory condition. The increased lipoxygenase pathway activity can contribute to inflammation and irritation in the mucous membranes, leading to symptoms such as a lump and irritation in the nose.

Question: A 27-year-old woman with sickle cell disease and at 39-weeks' gestation is brought to the emergency department in active labor. She has had multiple episodes of acute chest syndrome and has required several transfusions in the past. She has a prolonged vaginal delivery complicated by postpartum bleeding, and she receives a transfusion of 1 unit of packed red blood cells. One hour later, the patient experiences acute flank pain. Her temperature is 38.7°C (101.6°F), pulse is 115/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 95/55 mm Hg. Foley catheter shows dark brown urine. Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following? (E) Low levels of serum IgA immunoglobulins (D) Positive blood cultures (B) Serum antibodies against class I HLA antigens (C) Positive direct Coombs test (A) Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on chest x-ray
Reason: The correct answer is (C) Positive direct Coombs test. This patient's sudden onset flank pain, dark brown urine, and signs of hemolysis after a blood transfusion suggest a transfusion reaction, likely due to hemolytic anemia. A positive direct Coombs test would indicate the presence of antibodies attached to the red blood cells, confirming an immune-mediated hemolytic process following the transfusion, which is consistent with her clinical presentation.
Answer: (C) Positive direct Coombs test

Let's analyze the case step by step.

1. **Patient Background**: The patient is a 56-year-old man with a history of non-small cell lung cancer that was treated successfully. He presents with subacute back pain that is worse at night and has point tenderness in the lumbosacral area.

2. **Pain Characteristics**: The pain is described as a dull, constant ache, which raises suspicion for a more serious underlying condition, especially given the history of cancer.

3. **Possible Causes of Back Pain**: In a patient with a history of cancer, back pain can be due to metastatic disease, which is a common complication. The nature of the pain (worse at night) and the point tenderness suggest a possible involvement of the spine.

4. **Imaging Findings**: 
   - **Lytic lesions** (C) are often associated with metastatic disease, particularly from cancers like lung cancer, which commonly metastasizes to the bones.
   - **Blastic lesions** (A) are more typical of prostate cancer or other cancers that cause increased bone density.
   - **Narrowing of the lumbar disc space** (D) and **bulging disc** (B) are more indicative of degenerative disc disease or herniated discs, which are less likely given the patient's cancer history and the nature of the pain.
   - **Sacroilitis and fusion of the lumbar spine** (E) are associated with inflammatory conditions like ankylosing spondylitis, which is less likely in this context.

Given the patient's history of lung cancer and the characteristics of his back pain, the most likely imaging finding would be:

**Answer: (C) Lytic lesions of the lumbar spine.** 

This is consistent with the possibility of metastatic disease from his previous lung cancer.

Question: A 47-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with ongoing dyspnea and confusion for 2 hours. She has a history of psychosis and alcohol abuse. She has smoked 1 pack per day for 25 years. She is agitated and confused. Her blood pressure is 165/95 mm Hg; pulse 110/min; respirations 35/min; and temperature, 36.7°C (98.1°F). The pulmonary examination shows tachypnea and mild generalized wheezing. Auscultation of the heart shows no abnormal sounds. The remainder of the physical examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show:
Serum
Na+ 138 mEq/L
CI- 100 mEq/L
Arterial blood gas analysis on room air
pH 7.37
pCO2 21 mm Hg
pO2 88 mm Hg
HCO3- 12 mEq/L
Which of the following best explains these findings? (A) Alcoholic ketoacidosis (C) Salicylate intoxication (D) Severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (E) Vomiting (B) Hyperventilation syndrome
Reason: The answer is (C) Salicylate intoxication. The patient's metabolic acidosis (evidenced by low pH and low HCO3-) combined with the respiratory alkalosis (indicated by low pCO2) suggests a primary metabolic acidosis with compensatory respiratory alkalosis, which is commonly seen in salicylate toxicity. Additionally, the confusion, agitation, and tachypnea are consistent with the neuropsychiatric and respiratory effects of salicylate overdose.
Answer: (C) Salicylate intoxication

Question: A 15-year-old girl presents with four days of malaise, painful joints, nodular swelling over her elbows, low-grade fever, and a rash on her chest and left shoulder. Two weeks ago, she complained of a sore throat that gradually improved but was not worked up. She was seen for a follow-up approximately one week later. At this visit her cardiac exam was notable for a late diastolic murmur heard best at the apex in the left lateral decubitus position with no radiation. Which of the following is the best step in the management of this patient? (D) Mitral valve repair (A) Penicillin therapy (E) Reassurance that this is a benign murmur and send home (B) NSAIDS for symptomatic relief (C) Aortic valve replacement
Reason: The answer is (A) Penicillin therapy. The patient’s symptoms and clinical findings, including joint pain, nodular swelling, low-grade fever, and the presence of a heart murmur, suggest a diagnosis of rheumatic fever, which often follows a streptococcal throat infection. Penicillin is crucial for treating and preventing the complications of rheumatic fever, including rheumatic heart disease, particularly in light of the history of a sore throat and the newly detected murmur.
Answer: (A) Penicillin therapy

Question: A 36-year-old woman with no significant medical history presents with a four-week history of epigastric pain. The pain tends to occur two hours after meals. She has lost 4 pounds over the last four weeks. She is allergic to azithromycin and clarithromycin. A urea breath test detects radiolabeled carbon dioxide in exhaled breath. Two days after starting definitive treatment, she returns to the hospital with flushing, headaches, nausea and vomiting after having a few beers that night. What is the mechanism of the drug involved in the adverse reaction? (E) Coating of the gastric lining (C) Binding to the 50S subunit of the ribosome (A) Formation of free radicals (B) Inhibition of H+/K+ ATPase in parietal cells (D) Binding to the 30S subunit of the ribosome
Reason: The answer is (A) Formation of free radicals. The patient was likely treated with metronidazole, which is commonly used to eradicate Helicobacter pylori and can cause a disulfiram-like reaction when alcohol is consumed. This adverse reaction arises from the formation of free radicals leading to the accumulation of acetaldehyde, resulting in flushing, headaches, nausea, and vomiting, particularly upon alcohol ingestion.
Answer: (A) Formation of free radicals
[INFO] CoT response generated.
Let's analyze the situation step by step. The patient is experiencing a disulfiram-like reaction after consuming alcohol while being treated with metronidazole. This reaction is characterized by symptoms such as facial flushing, nausea, tachycardia, dyspnea, headache, and abdominal cramps.

The mechanism behind this reaction involves the inhibition of aldehyde dehydrogenase, an enzyme responsible for metabolizing acetaldehyde, a byproduct of alcohol metabolism. When alcohol is consumed, acetaldehyde accumulates in the body, leading to the symptoms described.

Given this information, the serum levels of which substance are likely elevated in this patient following alcohol consumption?

The correct answer is:
(A) Acetaldehyde

This is because the disulfiram-like reaction leads to an accumulation of acetaldehyde due to the inhibition of its metabolism.

Question: A 68-year-old man comes to the physician because of recurrent episodes of nausea and abdominal discomfort for the past 4 months. The discomfort is located in the upper abdomen and sometimes occurs after eating, especially after a big meal. He has tried to go for a walk after dinner to help with digestion, but his complaints have only increased. For the past 3 weeks he has also had symptoms while climbing the stairs to his apartment. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and stage 2 peripheral arterial disease. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for the past 45 years. He drinks one to two beers daily and occasionally more on weekends. His current medications include metformin, enalapril, and aspirin. He is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 126 kg (278 lb); BMI is 45 kg/m2. His temperature is 36.4°C (97.5°F), pulse is 78/min, and blood pressure is 148/86 mm Hg. On physical examination, the abdomen is soft and nontender with no organomegaly. Foot pulses are absent bilaterally. An ECG shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis? (D) Cardiac stress test (A) Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (E) Abdominal ultrasonography of the right upper quadrant (B) CT scan of the abdomen (C) Hydrogen breath test
Reason: The answer is (D) Cardiac stress test because this patient presents with several risk factors for coronary artery disease, including age, diabetes, smoking history, and peripheral arterial disease, which raises the concern for cardiac-related symptoms. Given the recurrent nausea and abdominal discomfort that worsens with exertion, it is important to evaluate for potential cardiac involvement before considering gastrointestinal causes.

Let's analyze the information provided step by step.

The stillborn infant exhibits several significant physical findings: a small pelvis, shallow intergluteal cleft, club feet, and an x-ray showing the absence of the sacrum and lumbar vertebrae. These findings are suggestive of a condition known as caudal regression syndrome or sacral agenesis, which is often associated with maternal factors.

Now, let's evaluate the options:

(A) Maternal oligohydramnios - This condition can lead to fetal deformities due to compression (part of Potter's sequence), but it is not the strongest predisposing factor for the specific findings described.

(B) Intrauterine alcohol exposure - This is known to cause a range of fetal abnormalities, including growth restriction and facial dysmorphisms, but it is not specifically linked to the skeletal abnormalities seen here.

(C) Chromosome 13 trisomy - This is associated with Patau syndrome, which has its own set of anomalies but does not specifically correlate with the findings described.

(D) Maternal diabetes - This condition is known to be associated with various fetal anomalies, including caudal regression syndrome, particularly in cases of poorly controlled diabetes.

(E) Chromosome 18 trisomy - This is associated with Edwards syndrome, which has its own set of anomalies but does not specifically correlate with the findings described.

Given the findings of the stillborn infant and the known associations, the strongest predisposing factor for this patient's condition is:

Question: A 53-year-old man is admitted to the intensive care unit from the emergency department with severe pancreatitis. Overnight, he starts to develop severe hypoxemia, and he is evaluated by a rapid response team. On exam the patient is breathing very quickly and has rales and decreased breath sounds bilaterally. He is placed on 50% FiO2, and an arterial blood gas is collected with the following results:

pH: 7.43
pCO2: 32 mmHg
pO2: 78 mmHg

The oxygen status of the patient continues to deteriorate, and he is placed on ventilator support. Which of the following would most likely be seen in this patient? (D) Intra-alveolar hyaline membrane formation (A) Decreased lecithin to sphingomyelin ratio (B) Diffuse lipid droplets and globules (C) Hemosiderin-laden alveolar macrophages (E) Large clot in pulmonary artery
Reason: The presence of intra-alveolar hyaline membrane formation is indicative of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), which can develop as a complication of severe pancreatic inflammation and associated conditions. Given the patient's severe hypoxemia, rapid breathing, and the presence of rales and decreased breath sounds, the clinical picture suggests significant pulmonary involvement, likely leading to the formation of hyaline membranes in the alveoli due to injury and inflammation.

Question: A 19-year-old male from rural West Virginia presents to his family medicine doctor to discuss why he is having trouble getting his wife pregnant. On exam, he is 6 feet 2 inches with a frail frame and broad hips for a male his size. He is noted to have mild gynecomastia, no facial hair, and small, underdeveloped testes. He claims that although he has a lower libido than most of his friends, he does have unprotected sex with his wife. His past medical history is notable for developmental delay and difficulties in school. What is the most likely chromosomal abnormality in this patient? (D) 47: XXY (B) Trisomy 21 (A) Trisomy 13 (E) 45: XO (C) 47: XYY
Reason: The symptoms presented by the patient—such as gynecomastia, underdeveloped testes, broad hips, low libido, and developmental delay—are suggestive of Klinefelter syndrome, which is characterized by the chromosomal abnormality 47, XXY. This condition typically results in the features of hypogonadism and estrogen excess, aligning with the patient's clinical presentation.
Answer: (D) 47: XXY

Let's analyze the situation step by step.

The patient is presenting with signs of significant volume depletion and possibly shock, indicated by his low blood pressure (85/59 mm Hg), tachycardia (pulse of 122/min), and pale appearance. He has a history of heavy alcohol use, which can lead to liver disease and portal hypertension, contributing to his symptoms.

1. **Pulmonary vascular resistance (D)**: This is unlikely to decrease in this patient, as he is likely experiencing hypovolemia and potential right heart strain.

2. **Carotid baroreceptor firing activity (C)**: In response to low blood pressure, baroreceptors would decrease their firing rate, but this is not what is being asked about in terms of a direct decrease in response to his condition.

3. **Cardiac inotropy (E)**: While cardiac contractility may be affected, the question asks for something that is most likely decreased in response to his current condition.

4. **Systemic vascular resistance (A)**: In a state of shock, systemic vascular resistance typically increases as the body attempts to maintain blood pressure.

5. **Fractional tissue oxygen extraction (B)**: In a state of shock, tissues may extract more oxygen due to decreased perfusion, so this is also unlikely to be decreased.

Given the context of the patient's condition, the most likely option that would be decreased in response to his current state of shock is **(C) Carotid baroreceptor firing activity**. This is because the low blood pressure would lead to decreased firing of the baroreceptors, which is a compensatory response to maintain blood pressure.

Therefore, the answer is: **(C) Carotid baroreceptor firing activity**.

Question: A 24-year-old woman with no past medical history is post operative day 2 from a cesarean section that resulted in the birth of her first child. She begins to cry when she's told that today's lunch will be gluten-free. Although the patient feels "exhausted" and has had trouble sleeping, she deeply desires to return home and take care of her newborn. The patient denies any changes in concentration or suicidal thoughts now or during the pregnancy. What is the diagnosis and likely outcome? (A) Postpartum "blues"; her symptoms are likely self-limited (E) Postpartum bipolar disorder; this patient will likely have future bipolar episodes (C) Major depressive episode; this patient is at high risk of recurrence (D) Postpartum psychosis; symptoms will resolve in time, but she needs treatment with antipsychotics, lithium, and/or antidepressants (B) Postpartum depression; the patient will likely remain depressed for at least six more months
Reason: The symptoms described, such as crying over something seemingly trivial and feelings of exhaustion, are common indicators of postpartum blues, which typically arise within the first few days after delivery. Given that the patient doesn't exhibit significant signs of major depressive disorder or other more severe conditions, her symptoms are likely to resolve on their own without intervention.

Question: A 16-year-old girl is brought to the physician by her mother because she has not attained menarche. She has no history of serious illness. She is at 50th percentile for height and weight. Examination shows no breast glandular tissue and no pubic hair development. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. A urine pregnancy test is negative. An ultrasound of the pelvis shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? (D) Serum FSH level (C) Progesterone challenge test (A) GnRH stimulation test (E) Serum testosterone level (B) Reassurance
Reason: The young girl exhibits signs of primary amenorrhea and lacks secondary sexual characteristics such as breast development and pubic hair. Measuring serum FSH levels is crucial in assessing ovarian function, which helps determine whether the issue lies with the ovaries (hypergonadotropic hypogonadism) or if it is a result of a problem in the hypothalamic-pituitary axis (hypogonadotropic hypogonadism).

Question: A 23-year-old nulligravida presents for evaluation 5 weeks after her last menstrual period. Her previous menstruation cycle was regular, and her medical history is benign. She is sexually active with one partner and does not use contraception. A urine dipstick pregnancy test is negative. The vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 120/80 mm Hg, heart rate 71/min, respiratory rate 13/min, and temperature 36.8°C (98.2°F). The physical examination is notable for breast engorgement, increased pigmentation of the nipples, and linea alba. The gynecologic examination demonstrates cervical and vaginal cyanosis.
Measurement of which of the following substances is most appropriate in this case? (D) Urinary estrogen metabolites (E) Blood human chorionic gonadotropin (C) Blood progesterone (A) Blood estriol (B) Urinary human chorionic gonadotropin
Reason: The patient exhibits signs that may indicate early pregnancy, such as breast engorgement and cervical and vaginal cyanosis, despite a negative urine pregnancy test. Measuring blood human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is the most appropriate next step, as it can provide a more accurate assessment of pregnancy status, especially in the early stages where urine tests may yield false negatives.
Answer: (E) Blood human chorionic gonadotropin

Let's analyze the information step by step.

The patient is a 14-year-old boy with right upper quadrant abdominal pain and gallstones. The laboratory findings indicate:

- Mild normocytic anemia with reticulocytosis
- Increased RDW (red cell distribution width)
- Indirect hyperbilirubinemia
- Negative Coombs test
- Increased fragility in hypotonic solution on osmotic fragility test

These findings suggest a hemolytic anemia, specifically hereditary spherocytosis, which is characterized by the presence of spherocytes due to the membrane defect in red blood cells. The increased fragility in hypotonic solutions supports this diagnosis.

Now, considering the options provided for what would be seen on a blood smear:

- (C) Sideroblasts: Typically seen in sideroblastic anemia, not related to this case.
- (D) Spherocytes: These are the expected findings in hereditary spherocytosis.
- (E) Dacrocytes: These are teardrop cells, often seen in myelofibrosis or other conditions, not typical for this case.
- (A) Hypersegmented neutrophils: Associated with megaloblastic anemia, not relevant here.
- (B) Schistocytes: These are fragmented red blood cells seen in microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, not consistent with the osmotic fragility test results.

Given the context and the findings, the most likely anticipated finding on a blood smear would be:

Question: A 31-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department for a severe throbbing headache, nausea, and photophobia for 3 hours. She has severe occipital pain and chest tightness. Prior to onset of symptoms, she had attended a networking event where she had red wine and, shortly after, a snack consisting of salami and some dried fruits. The patient has recurrent migraine headaches and depression, for which she takes medication daily. She is mildly distressed, diaphoretic, and her face is flushed. Her temperature is 37.0°C (98.6 F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 195/130 mmHg. She is alert and oriented. Deep-tendon reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. This patient's symptoms are most likely caused by a side effect of which of the following medications? (C) Phenelzine (E) Valproic acid (A) Ibuprofen (B) Verapamil (D) Topiramate
Reason: The symptoms described in the scenario, including severe headache, nausea, photophobia, and the significant hypertension, suggest a potential hypertensive crisis. Phenelzine is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), and patients taking MAOIs must avoid tyramine-rich foods, such as salami and red wine, as these can lead to such adverse reactions. This relationship between the medication and dietary restrictions supports the conclusion that Phenelzine is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms.

Question: A 38-year-old man presents with a 1-year history of resting tremor and clumsiness in his right hand. He says his symptoms are progressively worsening and are starting to interfere with his work. He has no significant past medical history and is not currently taking any medications. The patient denies any smoking history, alcohol, or recreational drug use. Family history is significant for his grandfather, who had a tremor, and his father, who passed away at a young age. Neither his brother nor his sister have tremors. Vital signs include: pulse 70/min, respiratory rate 15/min, blood pressure 124/70 mm Hg, and temperature 36.7°C (98.1°F). Physical examination reveals decreased facial expression, hypophonia, resting tremor in the right hand, rigidity in the upper limbs, and normal deep tendon reflexes. No abnormalities of posture are seen and gait is normal except for decreased arm swing on the right. The remainder of the exam is unremarkable. Which of the following medications would be most effective in treating this patient’s movement problems and his depression? (C) Entacapone (E) Levodopa/carbidopa (A) Benztropine (D) Bromocriptine (B) Selegiline
Reason: Selegiline is a selective MAO-B inhibitor that can help improve motor symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease and also has antidepressant properties due to its action on neurotransmitter levels. Since the patient presents with resting tremor, rigidity, and signs of depression, selegiline is appropriate as it addresses both the movement disorders associated with Parkinson's and the depressive symptoms, making it the most effective choice among the listed options.

Question: A 65-year-old woman arrives for her annual physical. She has no specific complaints. She has seasonal allergies and takes loratadine. She had a cholecystectomy 15 years ago. Her last menstrual period was 9 years ago. Both her mother and her maternal aunt had breast cancer. A physical examination is unremarkable. The patient is given the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and the shingles vaccine. A dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan is obtained. Her T-score is -2.6. She is prescribed a new medication. The next month the patient returns to her primary care physician complaining of hot flashes. Which of the following is the most likely medication the patient was prescribed? (D) Teriparatide (B) Denosumab (A) Alendronate (C) Raloxifene (E) Zoledronic acid
Reason: Raloxifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that can be prescribed to postmenopausal women for the treatment of osteoporosis, especially in those who may have an increased risk for breast cancer as it has estrogen-like effects on bone without stimulating breast tissue. Given this patient's history of osteoporosis, her menopause status, and the hot flashes she reported following the new medication, it is likely that she was prescribed Raloxifene, which can lead to such side effects due to its estrogenic activity.
Answer: (C) Raloxifene

Let's analyze the situation step by step. The patient is experiencing a whistling noise when breathing through her nose three months after rhinoplasty. This symptom suggests that there is an abnormal airflow pattern through the nasal passages.

1. **Post-operative swelling (A)**: While swelling can affect airflow, it typically resolves within weeks after surgery, and three months post-op would likely not result in a whistling noise.

2. **Excessive columellar show (D)**: This refers to the visibility of the columella (the tissue between the nostrils) and is unlikely to cause a whistling noise.

3. **Fracture of the bony septum (E)**: A fracture could potentially cause nasal obstruction, but it would not typically lead to a whistling sound.

4. **Deviated septum that is now straight (C)**: If the septum was previously deviated and is now straightened, it could alter airflow dynamics, but it would not typically cause a whistling noise unless there was a significant change in airflow patterns.

5. **Septal hematoma causing a perforation (B)**: A septal hematoma can lead to a perforation in the septum, which can create an abnormal airflow pattern and result in a whistling sound when breathing.

Given the context of the question and the options provided, the most likely cause of the whistling noise in this patient is:

**Answer: (B) A septal hematoma causing a perforation.**

During this time, he has woken up to a wet pillow in the morning on multiple occasions and has not been as hungry as usual. He was diagnosed with HIV infection 1 year ago. He currently stays at a homeless shelter. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 22 years. He has a history of intravenous illicit drug use. He drinks 5–6 beers daily. He is receiving combined antiretroviral therapy but sometimes misses doses. His temperature is 38.6°C (101.5°F), pulse is 106/min, and blood pressure is 125/85 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 94%. Auscultation shows decreased breath sounds over the left base of the lung. There is dullness to percussion on the left lower part of the chest. Laboratory studies show:
Hemoglobin 14 g/dL
Leukocyte count 5,000/mm3
CD4+ T lymphocytes 240/mm3 (N > 500)
Serum
Creatinine 0.9 mg/dL
γ-Glutamyltransferase (GGT) 65 U/L (N = 5–50)
Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 15 U/L
Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 19 U/L
Alkaline phosphatase 40 U/L
Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 50 U/L
An x-ray of the chest shows a left-sided pleural effusion and hilar lymphadenopathy. Analysis of the pleural fluid shows an effusion with lymphocyte-predominant leukocytosis, high protein, an LDH of 500 U/L, and high adenosine deaminase. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?" (B) Rheumatoid arthritis (E) Pulmonary tuberculosis
" (A) Cirrhosis (C) Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (D) Lung cancer
Reason: The answer is (E) Pulmonary tuberculosis because the patient's presentation, including HIV infection, fever, cough, and the analysis of pleural fluid showing lymphocyte-predominant leukocytosis, high protein, elevated LDH, and high adenosine deaminase, are consistent with a diagnosis of tuberculous pleuritis. Additionally, the patient's immunocompromised state due to low CD4+ T lymphocyte count further increases the likelihood of tuberculosis as the underlying cause of his pleural effusion.
Answer: (E) Pulmonary tuberculosis

Let's analyze the options step by step.

A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is true, but the researchers incorrectly reject it, concluding that there is a significant effect or difference when there is none. 

Now, let's evaluate the options:

(A) A type 1 error means the study is not significantly powered to detect a true difference between study groups.  
- This statement is incorrect. A type 1 error is not related to the power of the study; it is about incorrectly rejecting a true null hypothesis.

(B) A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is true but is rejected in error.  
- This statement is correct. It accurately describes a type 1 error.

(C) A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is false, yet is accepted in error.  
- This statement describes a type 2 error, not a type 1 error.

(D) A type 1 error is a beta (β) error and is usually 0.1 or 0.2.  
- This statement is incorrect. A type 1 error is denoted by alpha (α), not beta (β). Beta errors relate to type 2 errors.

(E) A type 1 error is dependent on the confidence interval of a study.  
- This statement is somewhat misleading. While the confidence interval is related to the significance level (alpha), a type 1 error itself is not directly dependent on the confidence interval.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is:

**Answer: (B) A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is true but is rejected in error.**

Question: A 45-year-old male presents to the hospital complaining of frequent headaches and a decreased libido. During the physical exam, the patient also states that he has recently been experiencing vision problems. The patient is suffering from what type of adenoma? (C) Corticotroph (A) Somatotroph (D) Thyrotroph (E) Gonadotroph (B) Lactotroph
Reason: The symptoms presented by the patient, including headaches, decreased libido, and vision problems, suggest the presence of a pituitary adenoma that is affecting hormone levels related to reproduction and sexual function. A lactotroph adenoma, which secretes prolactin, can lead to decreased libido and is commonly associated with headaches and may also cause vision disturbances due to pressure effects on surrounding structures.
Answer: (B) Lactotroph

Question: A 35-year-old African American man presents with fever, abdominal pain, and severe weakness since yesterday. On physical examination, the patient is jaundiced and shows a generalized pallor. Past medical history is significant for recently receiving anti-malaria prophylaxis before visiting Nigeria. Laboratory tests show normal glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) levels. Peripheral smear shows the presence of bite cells and Heinz bodies. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient? (B) Sickle cell disease (E) Glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency (A) Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (C) Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (D) Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH)
Reason: The presence of bite cells and Heinz bodies on the peripheral smear suggests oxidative damage to red blood cells, which is characteristic of G6PD deficiency. Even though the patient has normal G6PD levels on laboratory testing, it is important to consider that levels can vary and may not reflect an acute hemolytic episode; the patient's symptoms following anti-malaria prophylaxis, which can induce oxidative stress, further support this diagnosis.
Answer: (E) Glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency

Question: A 21-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with complaints of intermittent bouts of lower abdominal and pelvic pain over the last week. The pain is primarily localized to the right side and is non-radiating. The patient is not sexually active at this time and is not currently under any medication. At the hospital, her vitals are normal. A pelvic examination reveals a tender palpable mass on the right adnexal structure. A pelvic CT scan reveals a 7-cm solid adnexal mass that was surgically removed with the ovary. Histological evaluation indicates sheets of uniform cells resembling a 'fried egg', consistent with dysgerminoma. Which of the following tumor markers is most likely elevated with this type of tumor? (E) Cancer antigen 125 (CA-125) (D) Inhibin A (B) Beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) (A) Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (C) Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)
Reason: Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is a tumor marker commonly associated with germ cell tumors, including dysgerminomas. In this case, the presentation of a solid adnexal mass, histological findings of uniform cells resembling 'fried eggs', and her age support a diagnosis of dysgerminoma, which elevates LDH levels.

Question: A 16-year-old Caucasian boy presents to your family practice office complaining of itchiness. He denies other symptoms. He also denies tobacco, alcohol, or other illicit drug use and is not sexually active. He has no other significant past medical or surgical history aside from a meniscal repair from a wrestling injury sustained two years ago from which he has recovered fully. Vitals are T 98.3, HR 67, BP 110/70. On exam you note several pruritic, erythematous, slightly raised annular patches with central clearing on his back.

Which of the following additional tests or features are sufficient to make the diagnosis of this boy's skin lesion? (B) History of recent herald patch and lesions along skin cleavage lines (C) Presence of hyphae when KOH added to skin scrapings (A) Acid-fast bacilli on smear from skin scrapings (D) Symmetrical distribution on bilaterial extremities progressing proximally (E) History of time spent in a Lyme-endemic region
Reason: The presence of hyphae when potassium hydroxide (KOH) is applied to skin scrapings is a definitive diagnostic test for dermatophyte infections, such as tinea corporis, which is indicated by the pruritic, erythematous annular patches with central clearing observed in this patient. This finding helps confirm a fungal infection, ruling out other potential causes of similar skin lesions.
Answer: (C) Presence of hyphae when KOH added to skin scrapings

Question: A 40-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 20 minutes after his wife found him unconscious on the bathroom floor. On arrival, he is conscious and alert. He remembers having palpitations and feeling lightheaded and short of breath before losing consciousness. He takes captopril for hypertension and glyburide for type 2 diabetes mellitus. His vitals are within normal limits. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Random serum glucose concentration is 85 mg/dL. An ECG shows a short PR interval and a wide QRS complex with initial slurring. Transthoracic echocardiography reveals normal echocardiographic findings with normal left ventricular systolic function. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's findings? (C) Low serum glucose levels (D) Accessory atrioventricular pathway (B) Ectopic foci within the ventricles (A) A dysfunctional AV node (E) Ischemic myocardial necrosis
Reason: The presence of a short PR interval combined with a wide QRS complex and initial slurring on the ECG suggests the presence of Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, which is characterized by an accessory atrioventricular pathway. This abnormal conduction pathway can lead to episodes of tachycardia, palpitations, and syncope, consistent with the symptoms experienced by the patient.
Answer: (D) Accessory atrioventricular pathway

Let's analyze the situation step by step. The 21-month-old boy has deformities in both legs that have been noticed since he started walking. The examination reveals that the knees do not stay together when the feet and ankles are placed together, which suggests a possible issue with the alignment of the legs, such as bowing (genu varum) or other developmental concerns.

Given that he is otherwise healthy, has normal developmental milestones, and his growth parameters are within normal limits, the most appropriate next step in management would be to assess the nature of the leg deformities further. 

In this case, an X-ray of the lower extremities would help determine if there are any underlying skeletal abnormalities or conditions contributing to the leg deformities. 

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is:

Question: A 25-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 2-week history of numbness in his left lower extremity. One month ago, he sustained a fracture of the neck of the left fibula during soccer practice that was treated with immobilization in a plaster cast. Physical examination of the left lower extremity is most likely to show which of the following findings? (B) Loss of sensation over the medial calf (E) Loss of sensation on the sole of the foot (A) Impaired dorsiflexion of the foot (C) Inability to stand on tiptoes (D) Decreased ankle reflex
Reason: The likely finding in this scenario is impaired dorsiflexion of the foot (A) because the fracture of the fibula may have affected the peroneal nerve, which is responsible for dorsiflexion. Damage to or irritation of the peroneal nerve can lead to weakness in this movement, as well as potential sensory loss in the areas it innervates.

Question: A 66-year-old man is admitted to the medical floor after being diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia. He has been in good health except for the use of steroids for the past 6 months for ulcerative colitis. The patient is started on the empiric therapy with ceftriaxone for the management of pneumonia. After 10 days of treatment in the hospital, he becomes tachypneic with a decreased level of consciousness. He develops generalized pustular eruptions all over his trunk. The temperature is 40.8°C (105.4°F), and the white blood cell count is 19,000/mm3. The gram stain of an aspirate shows many budding yeasts and neutrophils. A culture of the skin specimen is positive for Candida albicans. The nitroblue tetrazolium test is normal. What is the most likely condition related to his signs and symptoms? (C) Chronic granulomatous disease (D) Myeloperoxidase deficiency (E) X-linked agammaglobulinemia (B) Chediak-Hegashi syndrome (A) Leukocyte adhesion deficiency-1
Reason: The most likely condition related to the patient's signs and symptoms is myeloperoxidase deficiency (D), which predisposes individuals to infections, particularly with certain fungi, like Candida albicans. The patient's history of steroid use could further compromise his immune response, leading to the manifestation of the infection and pustular eruptions noted in the clinical presentation.
Answer: (D) Myeloperoxidase deficiency

Let's analyze the question step by step.

The patient is being prescribed high-dose niacin (vitamin B3) for hypertriglyceridemia. One of the common side effects of niacin is flushing, which is often accompanied by itching and a sensation of warmth. This flushing is thought to be mediated by the release of prostaglandins, which are compounds that cause vasodilation and increased blood flow to the skin.

To prevent this flushing, physicians often recommend taking aspirin before administering niacin, as aspirin can inhibit the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes that are responsible for the production of prostaglandins.

Now, let's look at the options provided:

(A) Bile deposition in the dermis - This is not related to niacin's side effects.
(B) Immune complex formation - This is not relevant to the flushing caused by niacin.
(C) Release of prostaglandins - This is the correct mechanism related to the flushing side effect of niacin.
(D) Mast cell degranulation - While mast cells can be involved in allergic reactions, they are not the primary mechanism for niacin flushing.
(E) T cell activation - This is not related to the flushing caused by niacin.

Based on this analysis, the answer is:

**Answer: (C) Release of prostaglandins**

Question: A 16-year-old girl with celiac disease is brought to the physician because of a 1-week history of generalized weakness and tingling around her mouth and in her fingertips. She also complains of abdominal cramps and nausea. In addition to following a gluten-free diet, she has been following a vegan diet for the past 2 years. Physical examination shows involuntary contractions of the muscle at the corner of her mouth and nose that are elicited by tapping on her right cheek. Her parathyroid hormone concentration is 834 pg/mL. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause for this patient's current condition? (C) Decreased dietary intake of ergocalciferol (E) Autoimmune-mediated destruction of parathyroid tissue (B) Decreased levels of renal 1α-hydroxylase (A) Decreased conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to cholecalciferol (D) Decreased intestinal absorption of ergocalciferol
Reason: The most likely underlying cause for this patient's current condition is decreased intestinal absorption of ergocalciferol. Given her celiac disease, which affects nutrient absorption in the intestine, coupled with her vegan diet that may not provide sufficient vitamin D or ergocalciferol, this would lead to inadequate levels impacting calcium metabolism and resulting in the symptoms observed, such as weakness and muscle contractions (tetany).

Question: A 59-year-old healthy woman presents to her primary care physician’s office six weeks after undergoing an elective breast augmentation procedure in the Dominican Republic. She was told by her surgeon to establish post-operative care once back in the United States. Today she is bothered by nausea and early satiety. Her past medical history is significant only for GERD for which she takes ranitidine. Since the surgery, she has also taken an unknown opioid pain medication that was given to her by the surgeon. She reports that she has been taking approximately ten pills a day. On examination she is afebrile with normal vital signs and her surgical incisions are healing well. Her abdomen is distended and tympanitic. The patient refuses to stop her pain medicine and laxatives are not effective; what medication could be prescribed to ameliorate her gastrointestinal symptoms? (B) Pantoprazole (A) Metoclopramide (E) Naproxen (C) Senna (D) Naloxegol
Reason: The appropriate medication to prescribe for this patient is naloxegol. This is because she is experiencing gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea and early satiety likely due to opioid-induced constipation, and naloxegol is a peripherally acting mu-opioid receptor antagonist that safely counteracts the constipating effects of opioids without affecting pain relief.
Answer: (D) Naloxegol

Let's analyze the situation step by step. The patient is experiencing a hypertensive emergency, and the medication being used is likely nitroglycerin or a similar agent that releases nitric oxide. 

Nitric oxide causes vasodilation by increasing cGMP in vascular smooth muscle, which leads to a decrease in systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and subsequently lowers blood pressure. 

In this context, the expected clinical effect of administering this medication would be:

- **Decreased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP)**: This is because vasodilation reduces the pressure in the pulmonary circulation, which is reflected in the PCWP.

Given the options provided, the correct answer is:

**(D) Decreased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure**. 

This effect is consistent with the vasodilatory action of the medication used in treating the hypertensive emergency.

Question: A 25-day-old male infant presents to the emergency department because his mother states that he has been acting irritable for the past 2 days and has now developed a fever. On exam, the infant appears uncomfortable and has a temperature of 39.1 C. IV access is immediately obtained and a complete blood count and blood cultures are drawn. Lumbar puncture demonstrates an elevated opening pressure, elevated polymorphonuclear neutrophil, elevated protein, and decreased glucose. Ampicillin and cefotaxime are immediately initiated and CSF culture eventually demonstrates infection with a Gram-negative rod. Which of the following properties of this organism was necessary for the infection of this infant? (C) K capsule (D) IgA protease (E) M protein (B) LPS endotoxin (A) Fimbriae
Reason: The K capsule is a critical virulence factor for certain Gram-negative bacteria, especially those that cause infections in infants, as it helps the organism evade the host's immune response by inhibiting phagocytosis. In this case, the presence of a Gram-negative rod in the CSF of a young infant suggests a significant risk for meningitis, and the K capsule would play a crucial role in the organism's ability to survive and establish infection in the vulnerable host.

Question: A 17-year-old female is brought to the emergency room by her parents shortly after a suicide attempt by aspirin overdose. Which of the following acid/base changes will occur FIRST in this patient? (B) Anion gap metabolic acidosis (C) Respiratory acidosis (D) Metabolic alkalosis (E) Respiratory alkalosis (A) Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis
Reason: In a case of aspirin overdose, the first acid-base change that occurs is respiratory alkalosis (E) due to initial hyperventilation caused by salicylate stimulation of the respiratory center. This hyperventilation leads to decreased carbon dioxide levels, resulting in a rise in blood pH and thus creating an alkalotic state before the metabolic acidosis develops as the overdose progresses.

Last year, she sustained a spinal compression fracture after lifting a box during a move. She currently takes oral isotretinoin and an oral contraceptive. The patient is at the 97th percentile for height and 50th percentile for weight. Physical examination shows numerous inflamed pustules on her face and upper back. Breast development is at Tanner stage I. The patient refuses to have a pelvic examination. A pelvic ultrasound shows ovaries with multiple cysts and a normal uterus. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? (B) Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (D) Turner syndrome (C) Hyperprolactinemia (A) Polycystic ovary syndrome (E) Aromatase deficiency
Reason: The most likely diagnosis for this patient is aromatase deficiency (E), as indicated by the presence of primary amenorrhea, clitoromegaly, and delayed breast development (Tanner stage I) despite normal ovarian morphology on ultrasound. Aromatase deficiency leads to impaired estrogen synthesis, resulting in virilization and a lack of secondary sexual characteristics, which aligns with the patient’s clinical presentation and history of abnormal hair growth and severe acne.
Answer: (E) Aromatase deficiency

Let's analyze the case step by step. The patient is a 69-year-old man with hip and back pain, which worsened after lifting a heavy object. He describes the pain as "electrical" and radiating down his leg, which suggests possible nerve involvement, likely due to a herniated disc or lumbar radiculopathy.

To confirm the diagnosis of a lumbar disc herniation or radiculopathy, the **straight leg raise test (C)** is commonly used. This test helps to assess for nerve root irritation or compression, particularly of the L5 or S1 nerve roots, which can cause pain that radiates down the leg.

Therefore, the most likely option to help confirm the diagnosis is:

Reason: The answer (B) suggests that the patient has an underlying primary immunodeficiency, which is indicated by the testing results and her recurrent infections. The positive dihydrorhodamine test and diminished myeloperoxidase staining point to a specific defect in phagocytic function, often characterized by an increased susceptibility to certain types of infections. Given her history of recurrent candidiasis and the findings during examination, it is likely that there are additional immune system impairments that are contributing to her symptoms, not just the one identified by the tests.
Answer: (B) The patient is likely to have another immune impairment besides the one for which she was tested.

Question: A 65-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 1-month history of progressive back pain. He has also had a 5-kg (11-lb) weight loss over the past 3 months. His only medications are a daily multivitamin and ibuprofen, which he takes daily for the back pain. Physical examination shows tenderness to palpation over the lower spine and the left iliac crest. His hemoglobin concentration is 9.3 g/dL, his serum calcium concentration is 12 mg/dL, and his serum creatinine concentration is 2.1 mg/dL. A bone marrow biopsy shows 21% plasma cells. A diagnosis of multiple myeloma is established. In preparation for an autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, the patient receives a myeloablative treatment regimen that includes busulfan. Which of the following drugs acts via a similar mechanism of action to busulfan? (A) Vemurafenib (D) Vincristine (E) Cytarabine (C) Lomustine (B) Etoposide
Reason: The answer (C) Lomustine is correct because both busulfan and lomustine are alkylating agents that cause DNA cross-linking and disrupt DNA replication, leading to cell death. This mechanism is critical in the treatment of cancers, including multiple myeloma, by targeting rapidly dividing cells in the bone marrow during the preparative regimen for stem cell transplantation.
Answer: (C) Lomustine

Question: A 70 year-old man comes to the physician for difficulty swallowing for 6 months. During this time, he has occasionally coughed up undigested food. He did not have weight loss or fever. Four weeks ago, he had an episode of sore throat, that resolved spontaneously. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 5 years. He has gastroesophageal reflux disease and osteoporosis. Current medications include alendronate and omeprazole. His temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 84/min, and blood pressure is 130/90 mmHg. On examination, he has foul-smelling breath and a fluctuant mass on the right neck. Which of the following is most likely involved in the pathogenesis of this patient's symptoms? (E) Adverse effect of medication
" (D) Abnormal esophageal motor function (B) Degeneration of neurons in the esophageal wall (A) Deep neck space infection (C) Cellular dysplasia
Reason: The answer (D) Abnormal esophageal motor function is likely correct because the patient's difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) and episodes of coughing up undigested food suggest an issue with esophageal motility rather than an obstruction or an infectious process. His history of gastroesophageal reflux disease and the presence of foul-smelling breath may indicate that stagnant food in the esophagus is not being cleared effectively, which can result from impaired esophageal muscle coordination or function.
Answer: (D) Abnormal esophageal motor function

To determine the most appropriate assessment of the woman's carrier status for the disease affecting her brother, we need to consider the inheritance pattern of the condition described.

The symptoms of the brother (mild developmental delay, pale complexion, and dietary restriction of phenylalanine) are suggestive of phenylketonuria (PKU), which is an autosomal recessive disorder. This means that both parents must be carriers of the gene mutation for their child to be affected.

1. The brother is affected, which means he has two copies of the mutated gene (let's denote it as "a").
2. Since both parents are healthy, they must each be carriers (Aa) of the gene, where "A" is the normal allele and "a" is the mutated allele.
3. The woman (sister) has no symptoms, so she could either be a carrier (Aa) or not a carrier (AA).

To assess her carrier status:
- If both parents are carriers (Aa), the possible genotypes for their children are:
  - AA (25% chance)
  - Aa (50% chance - carrier)
  - aa (25% chance - affected)

Since the brother is affected (aa), we know that both parents are carriers (Aa). Therefore, the woman has a 50% chance of being a carrier (Aa) and a 50% chance of being non-carrier (AA).

Thus, the most appropriate assessment of her carrier status is:
**Answer: (E) 50%**

Question: A 33-year-old woman presents to the clinic complaining of a 9-month history of weight loss, fatigue, and a general sense of malaise. She additionally complains of an unusual sensation in her chest upon rapidly rising from a supine to a standing position. Current vitals include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), pulse of 72/min, blood pressure of 118/63 mm Hg, and a respiratory rate of 15/min. Her BMI is 21 kg/m2. Auscultation demonstrates an early-mid diastole low-pitched sound at the apex of the heart. A chest X-ray reveals a poorly demarcated abnormality in the heart and requires CT imaging for further analysis. What would most likely be seen on CT imaging? (D) Tumor within the left atria (E) Connection between the pulmonary artery and aorta (B) Fistula between the right and left atria (C) Normal cardiac imaging (A) Tumor within the right atria
Reason: The patient's symptoms, including weight loss, fatigue, malaise, and the unusual sensation in the chest when changing positions, may indicate a mass in the heart. The presence of an early-mid diastolic low-pitched sound at the apex during auscultation could suggest a pathological condition such as a tumor, and given the context of requiring CT imaging for further analysis of a poorly demarcated cardiac abnormality, a tumor within the left atrium is a plausible finding on imaging.
Answer: (D) Tumor within the left atria

Question: A 57-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department because of crampy abdominal pain and foul-smelling, watery diarrhea. One week ago, she underwent treatment of cellulitis with clindamycin. She has developed shortness of breath and urticaria after treatment with vancomycin in the past. Her temperature is 38.4°C (101.1°F). Abdominal examination shows mild tenderness in the left lower quadrant. Her leukocyte count is 12,800/mm3. An enzyme immunoassay is positive for glutamate dehydrogenase antigen and toxins A and B. Which of the following is the mechanism of action of the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient's condition? (C) Inhibition of bacterial topoisomerases II and IV (E) Inhibition of RNA polymerase sigma subunit (B) Blocking of protein synthesis at 50S ribosomal subunit (A) Inhibition of cell wall peptidoglycan formation (D) Generation of toxic free radical metabolites
Reason: The patient presents with symptoms consistent with Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), which is often treated with antibiotics that target bacterial RNA synthesis. The most appropriate pharmacotherapy for CDI is usually fidaxomicin, which specifically inhibits RNA polymerase in bacteria, leading to reduced toxin production and bacterial growth. Therefore, the mechanism of action of this treatment is the inhibition of RNA polymerase sigma subunit.
Answer: (E) Inhibition of RNA polymerase sigma subunit

Question: A 45-year-old woman gravida 1, para 1, comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of a right breast lump and a 4.5-kg (10-lb) weight loss. She has not had any breast pain or nipple discharge. She had right breast mastitis 10 years ago while breastfeeding but has no other history of serious illness. Palpation of the right breast shows a 3-cm firm mass with well-defined margins lateral to the right nipple . There is dimpling of the overlying skin but no rash. The left breast is normal. A mammogram shows a density with calcifications in a star-shaped formation in the same location of the mass. Histological examination of a biopsy specimen from the breast mass is most likely to show which of the following? (A) Dilated ducts lined with neoplastic cells and necrotic centers (E) Infiltration of ductal cells blocking the dermal lymphatics (D) Orderly rows of monomorphic cells that do not stain with E-cadherin (C) Large, pink-staining cells in the epidermis (B) Disorganized nests of glandular cells with surrounding fibrosis
Reason: The patient's presentation is suggestive of invasive breast cancer, specifically invasive lobular carcinoma or invasive ductal carcinoma, indicative of a more aggressive process with a palpable mass and associated skin changes. The mammogram findings of density and calcifications, combined with the described histological characteristics, point towards disorganized nests of glandular cells with surrounding fibrosis, which is a common feature of ductal carcinoma.
Answer: (B) Disorganized nests of glandular cells with surrounding fibrosis

Let's analyze the situation step by step. The patient is presenting with signs of altered mental status, muscle rigidity, hyperthermia, and autonomic instability after being found unconscious. These symptoms are suggestive of a serious condition, likely neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) or serotonin syndrome, especially given the context of a college party where substances may have been involved.

The key features to note are:
- Muscle rigidity
- Hyperthermia (temperature of 103°F)
- Altered mental status
- Autonomic instability (elevated pulse and blood pressure)

Given that the patient is exhibiting muscle rigidity and hyperthermia, the most appropriate next step in management is to administer dantrolene, which is effective in treating malignant hyperthermia and NMS by reducing muscle rigidity and hyperthermia.

Therefore, the best next step in management is:
**(B) Dantrolene**

Question: A 75-year-old man with a 35-pack-year history of smoking is found to be lethargic three days being admitted with a femur fracture following a motor vehicle accident. His recovery has been progressing well thus far, though pain continued to be present. On exam, the patient minimally responsive with pinpoint pupils. Vital signs are blood pressure of 115/65 mmHg, HR 80/min, respiratory rate 6/min, and oxygen saturation of 87% on room air. Arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.24 (Normal: 7.35-7.45), PaCO2 of 60mm Hg (normal 35-45mm Hg), a HCO3 of 23 mEq/L (normal 21-28 mEq/L) and a Pa02 of 60 mmHg (normal 80-100 mmHg). Which of the following is the most appropriate therapy at this time? (A) Repeat catheterization (D) Naloxone (C) Heparin (B) Glucocorticoids (E) Emergent cardiac surgery
Reason: The most appropriate therapy for this patient is Naloxone (D). The clinical presentation suggests respiratory depression, likely due to opioid overdose, indicated by lethargy, pinpoint pupils, and significantly decreased respiratory rate and oxygen saturation, along with the metabolic acidosis and hypercapnia evident in the arterial blood gas results. Naloxone is an antagonist that can rapidly reverse the effects of opioids, restoring normal respiratory function and improving oxygenation.

Question: A 67-year-old woman comes to the physician with a 4-month history of chest pain that occurs on exertion. The pain is dull, and she experiences retrosternal pressure when she walks up the stairs to her apartment on the fifth floor. The pain disappears shortly after stopping for one minute. She has hypertension, for which she takes lisinopril and metoprolol daily. She does not smoke or drink alcohol. She is 158 cm (5 ft 2 in) tall and weighs 82 kg (180 lb); BMI is 33 kg/m2. Her pulse is 72/min and blood pressure is 140/85 mm Hg. Cardiac examination shows no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Fasting lipid studies show:
Total cholesterol 196 mg/dL
LDL 110 mg/dL
HDL 50 mg/dL
A resting ECG shows no abnormalities. A week after uneventful initiation of aspirin, the patient is started on atorvastatin. This patient is most likely to develop which of the following?" (D) Cholelithiasis (B) Myositis (A) Bloating (C) Elevated transaminases (E) Flushing
"
Reason: The most likely outcome for this patient starting atorvastatin is elevated transaminases (C). Statins can occasionally lead to liver enzyme elevations, typically presenting as increases in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), thus necessitating monitoring of liver function tests in patients initiated on this medication. Given the patient's profile and the common side effects associated with atorvastatin, elevated liver enzymes are a reasonable expectation.
Answer: (C) Elevated transaminases

Question: An 80-year-old woman presents with general malaise and low-grade fever. Physical examination reveals several retinal hemorrhages with pale centers, erythematous nodules on palms that are not painful, and splinter hemorrhages under her fingernails. Echocardiogram shows vegetations on the mitral valve. Blood culture indicates gram-positive bacteria which are catalase negative and able to grow in 40% bile; however, not in 6.5% NaCl. In addition to endocarditis, the doctor is concerned that the patient may also be suffering from which of the following medical conditions? (A) Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (C) Dental caries (B) Sickle cell disease (D) HIV/AIDS (E) Colon cancer
Reason: The patient is likely suffering from colon cancer (E) in addition to endocarditis. The presence of splinter hemorrhages, pale-centered retinal hemorrhages, and the specific organism cultured (a catalase-negative gram-positive bacterium that can grow in bile but not in salt) can suggest an association with certain malignancies, such as colon cancer, particularly in elderly patients with unexplained systemic symptoms like malaise and fever, often seen in paraneoplastic syndromes. Additionally, a common type of infective endocarditis can arise in patients with underlying colon malignancies.
Answer: (E) Colon cancer

Let's analyze the situation step by step.

The patient has a mid-systolic murmur that radiates to the carotids, which is suggestive of aortic stenosis. When the physician instructs the patient to stand from a supine position, this maneuver typically leads to a decrease in venous return to the heart due to the effects of gravity. 

1. **Standing from Supine Position**: When a person stands up, blood pools in the lower extremities, which reduces the amount of blood returning to the heart (preload). This can lead to a decrease in stroke volume and cardiac output temporarily.

2. **Effects on Cardiac Pressures**: 
   - **Right Atrial Pressure**: This would likely decrease due to reduced venous return.
   - **Left Ventricular End-Diastolic Pressure (LVEDP)**: This would also decrease due to reduced preload.
   - **Pulmonary Capillary Wedge Pressure (PCWP)**: This would decrease as well, as it reflects left atrial pressure, which is influenced by left ventricular filling.
   - **Diastolic Filling Time**: This would not necessarily change significantly with standing; however, the heart rate may increase to compensate for the reduced stroke volume, which could reduce diastolic filling time slightly.

3. **Conclusion**: Given the options, the most appropriate answer is that there would be a reduction in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (B) due to decreased preload from standing.

Therefore, the answer is: **(B) An increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure**.

Question: A 67-year-old man with a past medical history of sleep apnea presents to the emergency room in severe respiratory distress. On exam, his blood pressure is 135/75 mmHg, heart rate is 110/min, respiratory rate is 34/min, and SpO2 is 73% on room air. He is intubated, admitted to the intensive care unit, and eventually requires a tracheostomy tube. After surgery, he continues to have episodes of apnea while sleeping. What is the most likely underlying cause of his apnea? (A) Incorrect ventilator settings (E) Heart failure (C) Obstructive sleep apnea (B) Central sleep apnea (D) Angioedema
Reason: The correct answer is (B) Central sleep apnea. This patient's history of sleep apnea and the need for intubation suggests a severe underlying issue affecting his respiratory drive. The presence of ongoing apneas after the tracheostomy indicates that the apnea episodes are likely due to a failure of the central nervous system to initiate breathing, characteristic of central sleep apnea, rather than obstruction related to the airway.
Answer: (B) Central sleep apnea

Question: A 52-year-old man is seen by his endocrinologist for routine followup of his type 2 diabetes. Although he has previously been on a number of medication regimens, his A1C has remained significantly elevated. In order to try to better control his glucose level, the endocrinologist prescribes a new medication. He explains that this new medication works by blocking the ability of his kidneys to reabsorb glucose and therefore causes glucose wasting in the urine. Which of the following medications has this mechanism of action? (E) Metformin (A) Acarbose (C) Exenatide (B) Canagliflozin (D) Glyburide
Reason: The correct answer is (B) Canagliflozin. This medication belongs to a class of drugs known as SGLT2 inhibitors, which inhibit the sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 in the kidneys, leading to decreased reabsorption of glucose and increased urinary glucose excretion. This mechanism helps lower blood glucose levels in patients with type 2 diabetes.
Answer: (B) Canagliflozin

Question: A 52-year-old man presents with a 5-week history of multiple cutaneous ulcers on his left forearm and neck, which he first noticed after returning from a 2-month stay in rural Peru. He does not recall any trauma or arthropod bites. The lesions began as non-pruritic erythematous papules that became enlarged, ulcerated, and crusted. There is no history of fever or abdominal pain. He has been sexually active with a single partner since their marriage at 24 years of age. The physical examination reveals erythematous, crusted plaques with central ulceration and a raised border. There is no fluctuance, drainage, or sporotrichoid spread. A punch biopsy was performed, which revealed an ulcerated lesion with a mixed inflammatory infiltrate. Amastigotes within dermal macrophages are seen on Giemsa staining. What is the most likely diagnosis? (B) Cutaneous leishmaniasis (A) Histoplasmosis (E) Cutaneous tuberculosis (D) Syphilis (C) Ecthyma
Reason: The correct answer is (B) Cutaneous leishmaniasis. The clinical presentation of non-pruritic erythematous papules that progress to ulcerated lesions, particularly following a trip to a tropical area like rural Peru, aligns with cutaneous leishmaniasis. The presence of amastigotes within dermal macrophages observed in the biopsy is a definitive finding supporting this diagnosis, as these parasites are characteristic of leishmanial infections.
Answer: (B) Cutaneous leishmaniasis

Let's analyze the situation step by step.

The patient is a 39-year-old African-American woman with a history of sarcoidosis presenting with hip pain that has been progressively worsening. The physical exam shows pain with manipulation of the hip but no restriction of range of motion. Given her history and the nature of her symptoms, we should consider the possibility of avascular necrosis (AVN) of the hip, which can be associated with conditions like sarcoidosis.

Now, let's evaluate the options for the most sensitive test for detecting avascular necrosis:

- **(E) Ultrasound of the hip**: While ultrasound can be useful for certain conditions, it is not the most sensitive test for detecting AVN.
  
- **(C) Radiograph of the hip**: X-rays can show changes in advanced cases of AVN, but they may not detect early changes.

- **(A) CT of the hip**: CT scans can provide detailed images and may show changes in AVN, but they are not the most sensitive.

- **(D) Radionuclide scan of the hip**: This can detect changes in blood flow and may indicate AVN, but it is not the most sensitive test.

- **(B) MRI of the hip**: MRI is the most sensitive test for detecting avascular necrosis. It can identify early changes in the bone marrow and detect AVN before it becomes apparent on X-rays or CT scans.

Given this analysis, the most sensitive test for detecting avascular necrosis in this patient is:

**Answer: (B) MRI of the hip**

Question: A 48-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 20 minutes after being rescued from a house fire. He reports headache, metallic taste, abdominal pain, and nausea. He appears confused and agitated. His pulse is 125/min, respirations are 33/min, and blood pressure is 100/65 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 98%. Physical examination shows a bright red color of the skin. His breath smells of bitter almonds. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy and appropriate pharmacotherapy are initiated. The expected beneficial effect of this drug is most likely due to which of the following mechanisms? (E) Inhibition of cytochrome c oxidase (D) Dissociation of carboxyhemoglobin (A) Reduction of ferric iron (C) Formation of methemoglobin (B) Synthesis of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate
Reason: The correct answer is (C) Formation of methemoglobin. The symptoms and breath odor suggest cyanide poisoning, which is often treated with agents like nitrites that induce methemoglobinemia. This is because methemoglobin has a higher affinity for cyanide compared to cytochrome c oxidase, thereby facilitating the binding and subsequent elimination of cyanide from the body.

Question: A 41-year-old man presents to urgent care with a 1-week history of severe diarrhea. He says that he has been having watery stools every 2-3 hours. The stools do not contain blood and do not float. On presentation, he is observed to have significant facial flushing, and laboratory tests reveal the following:

Serum:
Na+: 137 mEq/L
K+: 2.7 mEq/L
Cl-: 113 mEq/L
HCO3-: 14 mEq/L

A computed tomography scan reveals a small intra-abdominal mass. Staining of this mass would most likely reveal production of which of the following? (B) Glucagon (E) Vasoactive intestinal peptide (D) Somatostatin (C) Insulin (A) Gastrin
Reason: The correct answer is (E) Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). The patient's severe diarrhea, significant facial flushing, and electrolyte imbalances suggest a VIPoma, a rare tumor that secretes vasoactive intestinal peptide, leading to profuse watery diarrhea and hypokalemia. The CT scan revealing an intra-abdominal mass further supports the likelihood of a VIPoma as the source of these symptoms.

Let's analyze the situation step by step.

The patient is a 74-year-old man who became unresponsive shortly after extubation following an open cholecystectomy. His vital signs show a low oxygen saturation of 73% despite being on a non-rebreather mask with 100% FiO2. The arterial blood gas analysis indicates:

- pH: 7.32 (acidosis)
- PCO2: 33 mm Hg (indicating respiratory compensation)
- PO2: 73 mm Hg (hypoxemia)
- HCO3: 22 mEq/L (normal)

Given that the patient is unresponsive and has significant hypoxemia (O2 saturation of 73%), the most appropriate next step in management is to secure the airway and ensure adequate ventilation.

The options are:
- (E) Start BiPAP: This could help with ventilation but may not be sufficient given the patient's unresponsiveness.
- (D) Close observation only: This is not appropriate given the patient's critical condition.
- (A) Perform tracheostomy: This is not an immediate step in an emergency situation.
- (C) Reintubate: This is the most appropriate step to secure the airway and provide adequate ventilation.
- (B) Continue using the non-rebreather mask: This is not effective given the patient's current state.

Considering the patient's unresponsiveness and severe hypoxemia, the best next step in management is to **reintubate** the patient to secure the airway and provide adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

Question: A 30-month-old toddler presents with his mother to the pediatrician for a scheduled follow-up. She is concerned that his appetite has been poor since the death of his father, approximately one year ago. She denies any history of vomiting, refusal of food, diarrhea, constipation, recurrent cough and colds, recurrent wheezing, fast breathing, recurrent fever, or recurrent infections. The boy was born at full term by vaginal delivery with an uneventful neonatal period and infancy. His vaccines are up to date. On physical examination, his vital signs are stable. His complete physical examination does not suggest a specific medical disorder or congenital abnormality. His detailed diagnostic evaluation, including complete blood counts, serum protein, liver function tests, and urinalysis are normal. The pediatrician reviews the patient’s growth chart.
At the age of 18 months he was at the 90th percentile for weight and 75th for height. After plotting his current growth parameters on the growth charts, the pediatrician suspects failure to thrive with psychosocial etiology. Based on which of the following findings on the growth charts did the pediatrician suspect the condition? (C) Present gender-specific height for age between 90 and 75 percentile markers (B) Present gender-specific weight for age between 75 and 50 percentile markers (E) Present gender-specific weight for height between 90 and 95 percentile markers (D) Present gender-specific height for age between 75 and 50 percentile markers (A) Present gender-specific weight for age between 90 and 75 percentile markers
Reason: The pediatrician suspected failure to thrive with psychosocial etiology based on the observation that the toddler's weight-for-age percentile has decreased from the 90th to the 75th percentile, suggesting a change in growth patterns that could be linked to emotional distress or social factors affecting his appetite. Weight-for-age is a critical indicator of growth and nutritional status, and a decline in this measure, particularly in the context of psychosocial stressors such as the loss of a parent, can indicate that the child is not receiving adequate nutrition and may be experiencing failure to thrive.

Question: A 60-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of progressively worsening urinary frequency. He feels the urge to urinate every hour or two, which restricts his daily activities and interferes with his sleep. He has no fever, hematuria, or burning pain on micturition. He has hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Current medications include metformin and amlodipine. He does not smoke and drinks 1 to 2 beers daily. His vital signs are within normal limits. Abdominal examination shows no abnormalities. Digital rectal examination shows a nontender, firm, symmetrically enlarged prostate with no nodules. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? (B) Prostate ultrasonography (C) Urine cytology (D) Serum prostate-specific antigen level (E) Uroflowmetry (A) Urinalysis
Reason: The most appropriate next step in management is a urinalysis because it helps assess for any urinary tract infections or other abnormalities, such as the presence of blood, that could explain the patient's urinary frequency symptoms. Given that the patient has no acute symptoms suggesting a serious condition and has a firm, symmetrically enlarged prostate, a urinalysis serves as an essential first diagnostic step before considering further investigations related to the prostate or urinary function.

Question: A 15-year-old girl presents with menorrhagia for the last 4 months. The patient’s mother says that she just started getting her period 4 months ago, which have been heavy and prolonged. The patient does recall getting a tooth extracted 3 years ago that was complicated by persistent bleeding afterward. She has no other significant past medical history and takes no current medications. Her vital signs include: blood pressure 118/76 mm Hg, respirations 17/min, pulse 64/min, temperature 36.7°C (98.0°F). Physical examination is unremarkable. Which of the following laboratory tests is most likely to be of the greatest diagnostic value in the workup of this patient? (C) Anti-cardiolipin antibodies (B) Partial thromboplastin time (PTT) (D) Ro/La autoantibodies (A) Factor IX assay (E) Prothrombin time (PT)
Reason: The partial thromboplastin time (PTT) is the most likely laboratory test to be of greatest diagnostic value in this patient because her history of menorrhagia and a previous episode of prolonged bleeding after a dental procedure suggest a possible coagulation disorder, such as von Willebrand disease or a factor deficiency. The PTT specifically evaluates the intrinsic pathway of coagulation and can help identify deficiencies in clotting factors that could be causing her heavy menstrual bleeding.

Let's analyze the options step by step.

The patient is classified as "pre-diabetic," which indicates that she has insulin resistance. To improve insulin sensitivity, we need to identify which of the listed options can enhance the body's response to insulin.

1. **Catecholamines (A)**: These hormones (like epinephrine and norepinephrine) generally promote gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis, which can actually decrease insulin sensitivity.

2. **TNF-alpha (E)**: This is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that is known to contribute to insulin resistance, so it would not increase insulin sensitivity.

3. **Glucocorticoids (C)**: These hormones (like cortisol) can increase blood glucose levels and promote insulin resistance, so they do not enhance insulin sensitivity.

4. **Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (D)**: This is a nuclear receptor that plays a crucial role in regulating glucose and lipid metabolism. Activation of PPAR-gamma improves insulin sensitivity and is a target for certain diabetes medications (like thiazolidinediones).

5. **Glucagon (B)**: This hormone raises blood glucose levels by promoting gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis, which would not increase insulin sensitivity.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is:

**Answer: (D) Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma**

Past medical history is significant for long-standing hypercholesterolemia and hypertension, managed medically with rosuvastatin and hydrochlorothiazide, respectively. His vital signs include: blood pressure, 140/95 mm Hg; pulse, 106/min; temperature, 37.2°C (98.9°F); and respiratory rate, 19/min. On physical examination, the patient is confused and unable to respond to commands. His mucus membranes are dry and he has tenting of the skin. The remainder of the exam is unremarkable. Laboratory findings are significant for the following:
Sodium 141 mEq/L
Potassium 4.1 mEq/L
Chloride 111 mEq/L
Bicarbonate 21 mEq/L
BUN 40 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.4 mg/dL
Glucose (fasting) 80 mg/dL
  Magnesium 1.9 mg/dL
Calcium 9.3 mg/dL
Phosphorous 3.6 mg/dL
24-hour urine collection
Urine Sodium 169 mEq/24 hr (ref: 100–260 mEq/24 hr)
Urine Creatinine 79.5 g/24 hr (ref: 1.0–1.6 g/24 hr)
Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient’s acute renal failure? (C) Sepsis (A) Acute tubular necrosis (E) UTI due to obstructive nephrolithiasis (B) Dehydration (D) NSAID use
Reason: The most likely cause of this patient's acute renal failure is dehydration. The signs of dry mucous membranes and skin tenting, along with the elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level, indicate a state of dehydration, which can significantly impair kidney function and lead to acute renal failure. Additionally, the patient's prolonged period alone without care may have exacerbated his dehydration status.
Answer: (B) Dehydration

Question: A 6-year-old girl presents to the clinic for a general checkup before her last scheduled DTaP vaccination. Her mother is concerned about mild swelling and redness at the site of injection after her daughter’s previous DTaP administration. The patient has mild spastic cerebral palsy. She was diagnosed with epilepsy at the age of 5, and it is well-controlled with levetiracetam. She is allergic to penicillin. Currently, she complains of malaise and mild breathlessness. The mother noted that her daughter has been sluggish for the last 3 days. Her vital signs are as follows: the blood pressure is 100/60 mm Hg, the heart rate is 90/min, the respiratory rate is 22/min, and the temperature is 38.8°C (101.8°F). On physical examination, the patient has slightly enlarged submandibular lymph nodes bilaterally and oropharyngeal erythema. On auscultation, there are diminished vesicular breath sounds with a few respiratory crackles over the lower lobe of the left lung. Which of the following factors requires delaying the patient’s vaccination? (E) Penicillin allergy (A) Cerebral palsy (C) Mild swelling and redness at the site of injection after the previous vaccine administration (B) Epilepsy (D) Signs of pneumonia
Reason: The vaccination should be delayed due to the patient's signs of pneumonia. The presence of symptoms such as malaise, mild breathlessness, fever, and diminished breath sounds over the lung indicates a potential respiratory infection, which can contraindicate vaccinations to prevent complications and ensure that the immune response is optimal. Vaccinating an individual with an active infection could not only diminish the efficacy of the vaccine but also pose a risk for further complicating their health status.
Answer: (D) Signs of pneumonia

Question: A 14-year-old boy is brought to the office by his mother with the complaint of increasing bilateral nasal obstruction for the past 5 months. He also complains of continuous bilateral nasal discharge. He adds that he no longer has any sense of smell of foods. Past medical history is significant for growth retardation and chronic bronchitis at the age of 6 years. Anterior rhinoscopy reveals multiple semi-transparent, soft and mobile masses in the middle meatus. Which of the following is the most likely etiology of this patient’s condition? (D) Nonallergic rhinopathy (E) Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma (A) Septal deviation (B) Nasal polyposis (C) Foreign body
Reason: The most likely etiology of this patient’s condition is nasal polyposis. The symptoms of increasing bilateral nasal obstruction, continuous nasal discharge, and the loss of smell, combined with the presence of soft and mobile masses in the middle meatus observed during an examination, strongly suggest the formation of nasal polyps, which are often associated with chronic inflammation and conditions such as asthma or cystic fibrosis. Additionally, the patient's history of chronic bronchitis and growth retardation may indicate an underlying condition that predisposes him to develop nasal polyps.
Answer: (B) Nasal polyposis

Let's analyze the information provided step by step.

1. **Patient's Symptoms**: The 21-year-old woman presents with right arm pain, limited range of motion, diarrhea, nausea, and pain during intercourse. She also has vague abdominal tenderness and has been to the ER multiple times for similar symptoms.

2. **No Trauma**: The absence of trauma to the arm suggests that the pain may not be due to a physical injury.

3. **Negative Fecal Occult Test**: This indicates that there is no evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding, which can help rule out certain gastrointestinal conditions.

4. **History of Frequent ER Visits**: The fact that she has been to the ER multiple times for similar symptoms suggests a pattern of recurrent complaints that may not have a clear medical explanation.

5. **Psychosomatic Considerations**: Given the recurrent nature of her symptoms, the lack of a clear physical cause, and the presence of multiple somatic complaints (arm pain, gastrointestinal symptoms, and sexual pain), this points towards a psychological component.

6. **Diagnosis Options**:
   - **Conversion Disorder (E)**: Characterized by neurological symptoms that cannot be explained by medical conditions, often following psychological stress.
   - **Somatization Disorder (C)**: Involves multiple physical complaints over time that cannot be fully explained by medical conditions.
   - **Ulcerative Colitis (A)**: A chronic inflammatory bowel disease, but the negative fecal occult test and lack of specific gastrointestinal symptoms make this less likely.
   - **Illness Anxiety Disorder (B)**: Preoccupation with having a serious illness, but this patient presents with actual physical symptoms.
   - **Somatoform Pain Disorder (D)**: Involves pain that is not fully explained by a medical condition and is often linked to psychological factors.

Given the recurrent nature of her symptoms, the lack of a clear medical explanation, and the presence of multiple somatic complaints, the most fitting diagnosis is **Somatization Disorder (C)**. 

**Answer: (C) Somatization disorder**

Question: A 14-year-old boy is brought to the physician for evaluation of his tall stature. His father is 174 cm (5 ft 7 in) tall; his mother is 162 cm (5 ft 3 in) tall. He is at the 99th percentile for height and 88th percentile for BMI. Examination shows pronounced sweat stains below the armpits and broad hands and feet. There is frontal bossing and protrusion of the mandible. His fasting serum glucose is 138 mg/dL. An x-ray of the left hand and wrist shows a bone age of 16 years. Which of the following is most likely involved in the pathogenesis of this patient's condition? (C) Tumor of the posterior pituitary gland (E) Mutated growth hormone receptor (A) Circulating TSH receptor autoantibodies (B) Increased serum insulin-like growth factor 1 (D) Mosaic mutation in G-protein signaling
Reason: The answer is likely (B) Increased serum insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) because elevated levels of IGF-1 are typically associated with conditions such as gigantism or acromegaly, which can present with tall stature, pronounced features, and other clinical signs described in this case. Additionally, the patient's elevated glucose levels and physical characteristics suggest excess growth hormone activity, which leads to increased IGF-1 production and ultimately contributes to abnormal growth patterns.
Answer: (B) Increased serum insulin-like growth factor 1

Question: A 45-year-old man presents with a 3-day history of right-sided flank pain due to a lodged ureteral stone. What changes would be expected to be seen at the level of glomerular filtration? (E) No change in filtration fraction (B) Increase in Bowman's space capillary oncotic pressure (D) Increase in filtration fraction (A) Increase in glomerular capillary oncotic pressure (C) Increase in Bowman's space hydrostatic pressure
Reason: The answer is likely (C) Increase in Bowman's space hydrostatic pressure because the presence of a lodged ureteral stone can obstruct the normal flow of urine, leading to an accumulation of fluid in the renal collecting system and resulting in increased pressure in Bowman's space. This increased hydrostatic pressure would counteract the normal pressures that facilitate glomerular filtration, ultimately affecting the glomerular filtration rate and dynamics.
Answer: (C) Increase in Bowman's space hydrostatic pressure

Question: A 25-year-old woman is brought to the physician by her mother because she refuses to get out of bed and spends most days crying or staring at the wall. Her symptoms started 3 months ago. The patient states that she is very sad most of the time and that none of the activities that used to interest her are interesting now. She sleeps more than 10 hours every night and naps during the day for several hours as well. Her mother, who cooks for her, says that she has been eating much larger portions than she did prior to the onset of her symptoms. The patient moved in with her mother after splitting up with her boyfriend and being expelled from her doctoral program at the local university, and she feels guilty for not being able to support herself. Two months ago, the patient was diagnosed with atypical depression and prescribed fluoxetine, which she has taken regularly since that time. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Mental status examination shows a depressed mood and flat affect. There is no evidence of suicidal ideation. Which of the following would be contraindicated as the next step in management? (C) Taper fluoxetine and then start venlafaxine (D) Continue fluoxetine and add bupropion (B) Taper fluoxetine and switch to desipramine (E) Continue fluoxetine and add phenelzine (A) Continue fluoxetine and increase dosage
Reason: The answer is likely (E) Continue fluoxetine and add phenelzine because combining a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) like fluoxetine with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) such as phenelzine can lead to a potentially life-threatening drug interaction called serotonin syndrome. This condition occurs due to excessive serotonin accumulation in the nervous system, which can be dangerous and is a known contraindication for combining these types of medications.
Answer: (E) Continue fluoxetine and add phenelzine

Let's think through the scenario step by step. The patient is a 12-year-old boy with a spontaneous nosebleed (epistaxis) from the left nostril, and there is no history of similar episodes or bleeding disorders. 

1. **Initial Management of Epistaxis**: The first step in managing a nosebleed is to apply direct pressure. This is typically done by pinching the nostrils together and leaning forward to prevent blood from flowing down the throat.

2. **Options Analysis**:
   - (B) **Oxymetazoline nasal spray**: This can help constrict blood vessels and reduce bleeding, but it is not the first-line immediate action.
   - (A) **Anterior packing and topical antibiotics**: This is more appropriate for persistent or recurrent bleeding after initial measures have failed.
   - (C) **Placement of an epinephrine gauze in the left nostril**: This is a more advanced intervention and not the first step.
   - (E) **Squeezing the nostrils manually for 10 minutes with the head elevated**: This is the standard first aid measure for managing a nosebleed.
   - (D) **Silver nitrate cauterization**: This is used for persistent bleeding after initial measures have failed.

Given that the boy is currently bleeding and the most appropriate initial therapy is to apply direct pressure, the best answer is:

**Answer: (E) Squeezing the nostrils manually for 10 minutes with the head elevated.**

Question: One week after an aortic valve replacement surgery, a 55-year-old man is brought to the emergency room 30 minutes after the onset of severe, sharp chest pain. He appears pale and dyspneic but is alert, oriented, and speaks in full sentences. His temperature is 38°C (100.4°F), pulse is 192/min and thready, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 80/50 mm Hg. Faint rales can be heard in the lower lung fields on both sides on auscultation. There is a midline thoracotomy scar with mild reddening but without warmth or discharge. A portion of an ECG is shown. The pattern remains unchanged after 1 minute. Which of the following is the most appropriate intervention? (E) Administer amiodarone (C) Vagal maneuvers (A) Epinephrine (D) Administer magnesium sulfate (B) Synchronized cardioversion
Reason: The clinical presentation suggests that the patient is experiencing a tachyarrhythmia, likely due to post-operative complications from aortic valve replacement surgery. Given the severe chest pain, hypotension, and the presence of a rapid, thready pulse, synchronized cardioversion is the most appropriate intervention to stabilize the patient and restore a normal heart rhythm.

Question: A 29-year-old mother brings in her 2-week-old baby boy to a pediatrician because he has been having difficulty feeding. The mother reveals that she had no prenatal care during her pregnancy and gave birth at home without complications. She says that her son seems to be having difficulty sucking, and she occasionally sees breast milk coming out of the infant’s nose. Physical exam reveals that this patient has a gap between his oral and nasal cavities behind the incisive foramen. He is therefore prescribed specialized bottles and his mom is taught positional techniques to ensure better feeding. Failure to fuse which of the following structures is most likely responsible for this patient's disorder?  (B) Maxillary and medial nasal prominences (C) Nasal septum with primary plates (A) Maxillary and lateral nasal prominences (E) Palatine shelves with primary plates (D) Palatine shelves with nasal septum
Reason: The case described is consistent with a cleft palate, which occurs when the palatine shelves fail to fuse properly with the nasal septum. This results in a gap between the oral and nasal cavities, leading to the feeding difficulties observed in the infant, such as difficulty sucking and milk coming out of the nose.
Answer: (D) Palatine shelves with nasal septum

Question: A scientist is designing experiments to better appreciate how the lung expands. He acquires two sets of cat lungs and fills one set with saline. He plots changes in the lungs' volume with respect to pressure as shown in Image A. The pressure-volume loop of the liquid-ventilated lung is different from the gas-ventilated lung because of what property? (E) Increased inspiratory pressure (D) Increased compliance (A) Reduced airway resistance (B) Increased residual volume (C) More pronounced hysteresis
Reason: The difference in the pressure-volume loop between the liquid-ventilated lung and the gas-ventilated lung is primarily due to the increased compliance observed in the liquid-filled lung. Compliance refers to the ease with which the lung expands; filling the lung with saline reduces surface tension effects, allowing for greater expansion at a given pressure, which would be reflected in an altered pressure-volume relationship.
Answer: (D) Increased compliance

Let's think through the scenario step by step. The patient has a positive RPR and FTA-ABS, indicating a diagnosis of syphilis. Given that he has a CD4 count of 175, he is at risk for opportunistic infections, but he does not show any neurological symptoms or signs of neurosyphilis.

In the case of syphilis, the treatment depends on the stage of the disease. Since the patient is asymptomatic and there is no indication of neurological involvement, it is reasonable to treat him for early syphilis with a single injection of benzathine penicillin G. 

The follow-up for titers is also important to ensure that the treatment is effective. In this case, obtaining titers in 3 months is appropriate to monitor the response to treatment.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is:

**Answer: (D) Treat with a single injection of penicillin, obtain titers in 3 months.**

Question: A 42-year-old man comes to the emergency department complaining of chest pain. He states that he was at the grocery store when he developed severe, burning chest pain along with palpitations and nausea. He screamed for someone to call an ambulance. He says this has happened before, including at least 4 episodes in the past month that were all in different locations including once at home. He is worried that it could happen at work and affect his employment status. He has no significant past medical history, and reports that he does not like taking medications. He has had trouble in the past with compliance due to side effects. The patient’s temperature is 98.9°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 133/74 mmHg, pulse is 110/min, and respirations are 20/min with an oxygen saturation of 99% on room air. On physical examination, the patient is tremulous and diaphoretic. He continually asks to be put on oxygen and something for his pain. An electrocardiogram is obtained that shows tachycardia. Initial troponin level is negative. A urine drug screen is negative. Thyroid stimulating hormone and free T4 levels are normal. Which of the following is first line therapy for the patient for long-term management? (B) Buspirone (D) Fluoxetine (C) Cognitive behavioral therapy (A) Alprazolam (E) Imipramine
Reason: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is often considered a first-line treatment for panic disorder, which the patient's presentation suggests. His recurrent episodes of severe chest pain, palpitations, and anxiety about future attacks indicate a potential diagnosis of panic disorder, and CBT can help patients learn to manage their symptoms and reduce the frequency of attacks without the need for medication.

Question: A 69-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department because of fatigue and lethargy for 5 days. She has also had weakness and nausea for the last 3 days. She has sarcoidosis, major depressive disorder, and hypertension. She had a stroke 5 years ago. Current medications include aspirin, nifedipine, prednisolone, fluoxetine, and rosuvastatin, but she has not taken any of her medications for 7 days due to international travel. Her temperature is 36.1°C (96.9°F), pulse is 95/min, and blood pressure is 85/65 mm Hg. She is lethargic but oriented. Examination shows no other abnormalities. Her hemoglobin concentration is 13.4 g/dL and leukocyte count is 9,600/mm3. Both serum cortisol and ACTH levels are decreased. This patient is most likely to have which of the following additional laboratory abnormalities? (D) Hypokalemia (B) Hyperkalemia (E) Hyponatremia
" (C) Hyperglycemia (A) Normal anion gap metabolic acidosis
Reason: Hyponatremia is a common laboratory finding in patients with adrenal insufficiency, which can occur when there is decreased cortisol production, as suggested by this patient's low serum cortisol and ACTH levels. In adrenal insufficiency, the body struggles to regulate water balance, leading to dilutional hyponatremia due to the retention of fluids without adequate sodium retention.

Question: A 27-year-old man presents to the emergency department following a motor vehicle accident. Having been found as a restrained driver, he did not suffer from any chest injuries; nevertheless, his legs were pinned in position by the front of the highly damaged vehicle. After a prolonged extrication, the man sustained multiple fractures on his left femur and tibia. That same night, he underwent surgery to address his left leg fractures. In the next morning, the man suddenly developed severe dyspnea. Upon examination, he is noted to have a diffuse petechial rash. His vital signs are the following: blood pressure is 111/67 mm Hg, pulse rate is 107/min, respiratory rate is 27/min, oxygen saturation level is 82%, and his body temperature is normal. What is the most likely mechanism of his respiratory distress? (D) Spontaneous pneumothorax (C) Bacterial pneumonia (A) Pulmonary edema (E) Fat embolism (B) Cardiac tamponade
Reason: Fat embolism is a recognized complication following long bone fractures, especially after surgical intervention. In this case, the patient's recent femur and tibia fractures, combined with the sudden onset of severe dyspnea and a petechial rash, strongly suggest that fat globules have entered the bloodstream and occluded pulmonary capillaries, leading to respiratory distress and low oxygen saturation.
Answer: (E) Fat embolism

Let's analyze the information provided step by step.

The patient is a 17-year-old woman who has not had her menstrual period for 4 months, has enlarged cheeks (which could indicate parotid gland enlargement), and calluses on the dorsum of her hands. She has been binge eating and is under stress, which suggests a possible eating disorder, specifically bulimia nervosa.

In bulimia nervosa, patients often engage in binge eating followed by compensatory behaviors such as vomiting, which can lead to dental erosion due to the exposure of teeth to stomach acid. The calluses on the dorsum of her hands (often referred to as "Russell's sign") are also indicative of self-induced vomiting.

Given this context, the most likely additional finding in this patient would be:

(C) Erosion of tooth enamel

This is a common consequence of repeated vomiting and is consistent with the signs and symptoms presented.

Question: A 23-year-old man presents to the office complaining of weight loss and fatigue for the past 2 months. He states that he has been experiencing foul-smelling, light-colored stools but thinks it is because he hasn’t been eating well, recently. He has a past medical history significant for cystic fibrosis, which is well-controlled medically. He denies any shortness of breath, chest or abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or melena. On physical examination, his skin is pale and dry. Which of the following would be the most likely etiology of a malabsorption syndrome giving rise to this patient’s current condition? (D) Decreased recycling of bile acids (E) Pancreatic insufficiency (B) Damage to intestinal brush border (A) Autoimmune damage to parietal cells (C) Chronic damage to intestinal mucosa
Reason: The most likely etiology of this patient's malabsorption syndrome is pancreatic insufficiency (E), which is a common complication in individuals with cystic fibrosis. This condition leads to inadequate enzyme production from the pancreas, resulting in poor digestion and malabsorption of nutrients, which aligns with the patient's symptoms of weight loss, fatigue, and foul-smelling, light-colored stools indicative of fat malabsorption.

Question: During the exam of a 2-day-old female neonate you determine that she appears lethargic, cyanotic, and has a coarse tremor of her right arm. The patient's mother explains that she observed what she believed to be seizure-like activity just before you arrived in the room. The mother has a history of type two diabetes mellitus and during childbirth there was a delay in cord clamping. You decide to get electrolytes and a complete blood count to work up this patient. The labs are significant for mild hypoglycemia and a hematocrit of 72%. What is the most effective treatment for this patient's condition? (A) Phlebotomy (C) Fluid resuscitation (D) Hydroxyurea (E) Interferon alpha (B) Partial exchange transfusion with hydration
Reason: The most effective treatment for this patient’s condition is a partial exchange transfusion with hydration (B), which is indicated due to her elevated hematocrit of 72%. This suggests polycythemia, which can lead to complications such as hyperviscosity syndrome, and a partial exchange transfusion helps to lower the hematocrit level while also addressing potential hypovolemia by providing hydration.

Question: A 46-year-old man presents to the clinic complaining of fatigue and difficulty breathing for the past month. He reports that it is particularly worse when he exercises as he becomes out of breath at 1 mile when he used to routinely run 3 miles. He is frustrated as he was recently diagnosed with diabetes despite a good diet and regular exercise. He denies any weight changes, chest pain, or gastrointestinal symptoms. When asked about other concerns, his wife complains that he is getting darker despite regular sunscreen application. A physical examination demonstrates a tanned man with an extra heart sound just before S1, mild bilateral pitting edema, and mild bibasilar rales bilaterally. An echocardiogram is ordered and shows a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 65% with reduced filling. What is the most likely explanation for this patient’s condition? (C) Infection with coxsackie B virus (E) Systemic inflammatory state caused by type 2 diabetes (D) Persistently elevated blood pressure (B) Increased intestinal absorption of iron (A) Decreased copper excretion into bile
Reason: The most likely explanation for this patient’s condition is increased intestinal absorption of iron (B), which is consistent with hemochromatosis. This condition can lead to excess iron accumulation in the body, resulting in symptoms such as diabetes, skin hyperpigmentation (the tan appearance), heart failure (evidenced by the additional heart sound and mild bilateral rales), and leg edema, as well as altered heart function despite a normal left ventricular ejection fraction.
Answer: (B) Increased intestinal absorption of iron

Let's analyze the situation step by step. 

1. The resident currently works 60 hours per week in his residency program.
2. He has an additional 10-hour shift on Saturdays, bringing his total to 70 hours per week.
3. He is free on Sundays, which means he has the potential to work additional hours on that day.

According to the ACGME standards, residents are limited to a maximum of 80 hours of work per week, averaged over a four-week period. This includes both residency hours and any moonlighting hours.

Now, let's evaluate the options:

- (C) He may work longer shifts: This is not accurate as the total hours worked must remain within the 80-hour limit.
- (A) He is already overcommitting and must reduce the number of hours: This is not accurate since he is not over the 80-hour limit yet.
- (B) He is not allowed to work outside the scope of his residency training: This is not entirely accurate; residents can moonlight as long as they adhere to ACGME guidelines.
- (E) He may work up to 20 more hours: This is not accurate because he can only work a total of 80 hours, and he is already at 70 hours.
- (D) He may work more hours on Sundays: This is the most accurate statement, as he is free on Sundays and can work additional hours as long as he does not exceed the 80-hour limit.

Given this analysis, the most accurate statement regarding this resident’s moonlighting and patient safety is:

Question: A 61-year-old woman who recently emigrated from India comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of fever, fatigue, night sweats, and a productive cough. She has had a 5-kg (11-lb) weight loss during this period. She has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and poorly controlled asthma. She has had multiple asthma exacerbations in the past year that were treated with glucocorticoids. An x-ray of the chest shows a cavitary lesion of the posterior apical segment of the left upper lobe with consolidation of the surrounding parenchyma. The pathogen identified on sputum culture is found to be resistant to multiple drugs, including streptomycin. Which of the following mechanisms is most likely involved in bacterial resistance to this drug? (B) Inhibition of bacterial synthesis of RNA (E) Upregulation of arabinosyl transferase production (A) Alteration in the sequence of gyrA genes (D) Upregulation of mycolic acid synthesis (C) Alteration in 30S ribosomal subunit
Reason: The described case and the resistance pattern to streptomycin suggest that the bacteria in question is likely Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which commonly presents with cavitary lesions in the lungs. The mechanism of action of streptomycin involves binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit and inhibiting protein synthesis; therefore, alterations in this subunit through mutations can lead to resistance against this antibiotic.

Question: A 76-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician with an intense, throbbing, right-sided headache. She has a history of migraine headaches and tried her usual medications this afternoon with no alleviation of symptoms. She states that this headache feels different because she also has pain in her jaw that is worse with chewing. The pain came on gradually and is getting worse. In addition, over the past few months, she has had some difficulty getting up out of chairs and raising both her arms over her head to put on her clothes. She has had no recent falls or injuries. On exam, the patient's temperature is 98.3°F (36.8°C), blood pressure is 115/70 mmHg, pulse is 93/min, and respirations are 15/min. The patient has tenderness over her right temple. She has no focal neurological deficits, and no abnormalities on fundoscopic exam. Her physical exam is otherwise within normal limits.

Given the patient's most likely diagnosis, which of the following methods of treatment should be used in order to prevent any further complications? (D) Lumbar puncture (C) High dose steroids (B) Thrombolytics (A) Antibiotics (E) Craniotomy
Reason: The clinical presentation of this 76-year-old woman, particularly the unilateral headache, jaw pain with chewing (jaw claudication), and symptoms suggestive of polymyalgia rheumatica, raises a strong suspicion for giant cell arteritis (GCA). High-dose steroids are the standard course of treatment for GCA to reduce the risk of vision loss and other serious complications associated with this condition, thereby addressing the underlying inflammation and preventing further complications.

Question: A 14-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department from school after falling in gym class. He was unable to stand after the accident and has a painful and swollen knee. On presentation he says that he has never had an incident like this before; however, he does suffer from hard to control nosebleeds and prolonged bleeding after minor cuts. Based on his presentation a panel of bleeding tests is obtained with the following results:

Bleeding time: Prolonged
Prothrombin time: Normal
Partial thromboplastin time: Prolonged

Which of the following describes the function of the component that is defective in the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms? (A) Binds to a nucleotide derivative (D) Catalyzes the conversion of factor X (E) It is a cofactor for an epoxide reductase (B) Binds to fibrinogen (C) Binds to subendothelial collagen
Reason: The combination of prolonged bleeding time, normal prothrombin time, and prolonged partial thromboplastin time suggests a deficiency in the intrinsic pathway of coagulation, commonly associated with von Willebrand disease (vWD). The defective component in vWD is von Willebrand factor (vWF), which is crucial for platelet adhesion by binding to subendothelial collagen and facilitating the recruitment and activation of platelets at the site of vascular injury, leading to the observed symptoms of bleeding and bruising in this patient.
Answer: (C) Binds to subendothelial collagen

Let's analyze the information step by step. 

The patient is a 28-year-old woman who has been trying to conceive for 2 years, and she has a history of abdominal surgery and a family history of endocrine abnormalities. Given her difficulty in conceiving, it is likely that she may have an issue related to ovulation or hormonal imbalance.

The treatment that is often used in such cases is clomiphene citrate, which is administered to stimulate ovulation. Clomiphene is typically given in the early part of the menstrual cycle, often starting about a week before ovulation.

Now, if clomiphene citrate were administered in a different manner, it could also be used to treat conditions related to hormonal imbalances. One such condition is polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), which is characterized by irregular ovulation and can lead to infertility. Clomiphene is commonly used to induce ovulation in women with PCOS.

Question: A 50-year-old man comes to the physician for the evaluation of recurrent episodes of chest pain, difficulty breathing, and rapid heart beating over the past two months. During this period, he has had a 4-kg (8.8-lb) weight loss, malaise, pain in both knees, and diffuse muscle pain. Five years ago, he was diagnosed with chronic hepatitis B infection and was started on tenofovir. His temperature is 38°C (100.4°F), pulse is 110/min, and blood pressure is 150/90 mm Hg. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities except for tachycardia. There are several ulcerations around the ankle and calves bilaterally. Laboratory studies show:
Hemoglobin 11 g/dL
Leukocyte count 14,000/mm3
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate 80 mm/h
Serum
Perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies negative
Hepatitis B surface antigen positive
Urine
Protein +2
RBC 6-7/hpf
Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?" (C) Polyarteritis nodosa (B) Giant cell arteritis (A) Takayasu arteritis (E) Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (D) Thromboangiitis obliterans
Reason: Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) is a type of vasculitis that can cause systemic symptoms and is associated with hepatitis B infection. The patient's presentation of recurrent chest pain, weight loss, malaise, ulcerations, and laboratory findings, such as elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), support the diagnosis of PAN, as it typically affects medium-sized arteries and can lead to renal and skin manifestations.
Answer: (C) Polyarteritis nodosa

Question: A 22-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department because of a 1-day history of double vision and rapidly worsening pain and swelling of her right eye. She had an upper respiratory tract infection a week ago after which she has had nasal congestion, recurrent headaches, and a purulent nasal discharge. She took antibiotics for her respiratory tract infection but did not complete the course. She has asthma treated with theophylline and inhaled β-adrenergic agonists and corticosteroids. She appears to be in severe distress. Her temperature is 38.5°C (101.3°F), pulse is 100/min, and blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg. Ophthalmic examination of the right eye shows proptosis and diffuse edema, erythema, and tenderness of the eyelids. Right eye movements are restricted and painful in all directions. The pupils are equal and reactive to light. There is tenderness to palpation over the right cheek and purulent nasal discharge in the right nasal cavity. The left eye shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show a leukocyte count of 12,000/mm3. Which of the following provides the strongest indication for administering intravenous antibiotics to this patient? (E) Fever
" (A) Worsening of ocular pain (C) Pain with eye movements (B) Leukocytosis (D) Purulent nasal discharge and right cheek tenderness
Reason: Pain with eye movements is a significant indicator of possible orbital involvement and can suggest serious complications like orbital cellulitis or abscess formation. In this clinical scenario, the presence of ocular pain, especially during movement, along with other symptoms such as proptosis and swelling, necessitates the urgent administration of intravenous antibiotics to prevent vision loss and further intracranial complications.
Answer: (C) Pain with eye movements

Question: A 56-year-old woman, gravida 3, para 3, comes to the physician because her left breast has become larger, hot, and itchy over the past 2 months. The patient felt a small lump in her left breast 1 year ago but did not seek medical attention at that time. She has hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Menarche was at the age of 11 years and menopause at the age of 46 years. Her mother died of breast cancer at the age of 45 years. The patient does not smoke or drink alcohol. Current medications include labetalol, simvastatin, and daily low-dose aspirin. She is 170 cm (5 ft 7 in) tall and weighs 78 kg (172 lb); BMI is 27 kg/m2. Her temperature is 37.7°C (99.9°F), pulse is 78/min, and blood pressure is 138/88 mm Hg. Examination shows large dense breasts. There is widespread erythema and edematous skin plaques over a breast mass in the left breast. The left breast is tender to touch and left-sided axillary lymphadenopathy is noted. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? (E) Inflammatory breast cancer (B) Mastitis (A) Paget's disease of the breast (D) Breast abscess (C) Breast fibroadenoma
Reason: Inflammatory breast cancer is characterized by rapid enlargement, erythema, edema, and tenderness of the breast, often with associated lymphadenopathy, which perfectly fits this patient's presentation. Given her history of a previous lump and a significant family history of breast cancer, this clinical picture raises strong suspicion for an aggressive form of breast cancer rather than a benign condition like mastitis or fibroadenoma.
Answer: (E) Inflammatory breast cancer

Let's analyze the information provided step by step.

1. **Patient Presentation**: The patient is a 68-year-old man with confusion, increased somnolence, and frequent urination. He has lost weight recently and has a history of Alzheimer dementia.

2. **Laboratory Values**: 
   - Sodium (Na+): 139 mEq/L (normal)
   - Chloride (Cl-): 100 mEq/L (normal)
   - Potassium (K+): 4.3 mEq/L (normal)
   - Bicarbonate (HCO3-): 25 mEq/L (normal)
   - Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN): 20 mg/dL (slightly elevated)
   - Glucose: 99 mg/dL (normal)
   - Creatinine: 1.1 mg/dL (normal)
   - Calcium (Ca2+): 12.2 mg/dL (elevated)
   - Parathyroid Hormone (PTH): 8 pg/mL (low)

3. **Interpretation of Lab Values**: The elevated calcium level (hypercalcemia) and low PTH suggest primary hyperparathyroidism or a malignancy-related hypercalcemia. Given the patient's confusion and somnolence, hypercalcemia is likely contributing to his acute symptoms.

4. **Management of Hypercalcemia**: The best long-term prophylaxis for managing hypercalcemia, especially if it is due to primary hyperparathyroidism or malignancy, would typically involve reducing the calcium levels and preventing future episodes.

5. **Options Analysis**:
   - (E) Teriparatide: This is a form of parathyroid hormone used for osteoporosis, not for hypercalcemia.
   - (B) Calcitonin: This can lower calcium levels but is not typically used for long-term management.
   - (A) Alendronate: This is a bisphosphonate used for osteoporosis and can help in cases of hypercalcemia due to malignancy but is not the first-line treatment for acute hypercalcemia.
   - (C) Furosemide: This diuretic can help promote calcium excretion in the urine and is often used in acute management of hypercalcemia.
   - (D) IV fluids: While IV fluids are important for acute management of hypercalcemia, they are not a long-term solution.

Given the need for long-term management of hypercalcemia, the best option among those listed is **(C) Furosemide**, as it can help with calcium excretion in the long term, especially if the hypercalcemia is due to primary hyperparathyroidism or malignancy. 

**Final Answer: (C) Furosemide**

Question: A 33-year-old man is brought by ambulance to the emergency room after being a passenger in a motor vehicle accident. An empty bottle of whiskey was found in his front seat, and the patient admits to having been drinking all night. He has multiple lacerations and bruising on his face and scalp and a supportive cervical collar is placed. He is endorsing a significant headache and starts vomiting in the emergency room. His vitals, however, are stable, and he is transported to the CT scanner. While there, he states that he does not want to have a CT scan and asks to be released. What is the most appropriate course of action? (A) Release the patient as requested (E) Agree to not do the CT scan (B) Explain to him that he is intoxicated and cannot make health care decisions, continue as planned (D) Call security (C) Have the patient fill the appropriate forms and discharge against medical advice
Reason: The most appropriate course of action is (B) to explain to him that he is intoxicated and cannot make health care decisions, and to continue with the planned CT scan. This response is essential because alcohol intoxication can impair cognitive function, affecting the patient's ability to comprehend the risks of refusing treatment, especially given his significant symptoms, which could indicate a traumatic brain injury. Continuing with the CT scan is crucial for ensuring his safety and proper medical care.
Answer: (B) Explain to him that he is intoxicated and cannot make health care decisions, continue as planned

Question: A 60-year-old African American gentleman presents to the emergency department with sudden onset "vice-like" chest pain, diaphoresis, and pain radiating to his left shoulder. He has ST elevations on his EKG and elevated cardiac enzymes. Concerning his current pathophysiology, which of the following changes would you expect to see in this patient? (E) Increased cardiac output; increased systemic vascular resistance (C) Decreased cardiac output; increased systemic vascular resistance (A) No change in cardiac output; increased systemic vascular resistance (B) No change in cardiac output; decreased venous return (D) Decreased cardiac output; decreased venous return
Reason: The most appropriate answer is (C) Decreased cardiac output; increased systemic vascular resistance. This conclusion can be drawn from the fact that during a myocardial infarction, such as that indicated by the patient’s ST elevations and elevated cardiac enzymes, the heart's ability to pump effectively is compromised, leading to decreased cardiac output. In response to the decreased cardiac output, the body often compensates by increasing systemic vascular resistance in an attempt to maintain blood pressure and perfusion, resulting in the observed physiological changes.
Answer: (C) Decreased cardiac output; increased systemic vascular resistance

Question: A 7-year-old boy presents to the urgent care from a friends birthday party with trouble breathing. He is immediately placed on supplemental oxygen therapy. His father explains that peanut butter treats were served at the event but he didn’t see his son actually eat one. During the party, his son approached him with facial flushing and some difficulty breathing while itching his face and neck. He was born at 40 weeks via spontaneous vaginal delivery. He has met all developmental milestones and is fully vaccinated. Past medical history is significant for peanut allergy and asthma. He carries an emergency inhaler. Family history is noncontributory.  His blood pressure is 110/85 mm Hg, the heart rate is 110/min, the respiratory rate is 25/min, and the temperature is 37.2°C (99.0°F). On physical examination, he has severe edema over his face and severe audible stridor in both lungs. Of the following, which type of hypersensitivity reaction is this patient experiencing?
  (B) Type 2 - cytotoxic hypersensitivity reaction (A) Type 1 - anaphylactic hypersensitivity reaction (E) Both A & B (C) Type 3 - immune complex mediated hypersensitivity reaction  (D) Type 4 - cell mediated (delayed) hypersensitivity reaction
Reason: The correct answer is (A) Type 1 - anaphylactic hypersensitivity reaction. This type of hypersensitivity is characterized by an immediate allergic reaction, mediated by IgE antibodies, upon exposure to an allergen, such as peanuts in this case. The symptoms presented, including trouble breathing, facial flushing, itching, and the patient's history of a peanut allergy, are indicative of an anaphylactic response, which can result in airway edema and respiratory distress necessitating immediate medical attention.
Answer: (A) Type 1 - anaphylactic hypersensitivity reaction

Let's analyze the situation step by step. The infant is one week old and presents with jaundice, which is common in newborns. The mother reports that the infant is breastfeeding well and has normal sleep patterns. 

In newborns, jaundice can be classified into two main types: physiological and pathological. Physiological jaundice typically occurs due to the immature liver's inability to process bilirubin effectively and usually resolves on its own. It is common in breastfed infants, especially in the first week of life.

Given that the infant is feeding well and there are no signs of significant illness or dehydration, the best treatment for physiological jaundice is often supportive care, which includes continuing breastfeeding. 

Therefore, the best answer is (E) Continue normal breast feeding. This approach allows for continued hydration and nutrition, which can help the infant's liver process bilirubin more effectively. 

Answer: (E) Continue normal breast feeding.

Question: A 35-year-old nulligravid woman and her 33-year-old husband come to the physician for genetic counseling prior to conception. The husband has had severe psoriasis since adolescence that is now well-controlled under combination treatment with UV light therapy and etanercept. His father and two brothers also have this condition, and the couple wants to know how likely it is that their child will have psoriasis. The inheritance pattern of this patient's illness is most similar to which of the following conditions? (C) Alport syndrome (E) Familial hypercholesterolemia (A) Schizophrenia (B) Alpha thalassemia minor (D) Oculocutaneous albinism
Reason: The answer is (A) Schizophrenia because psoriasis has a complex inheritance pattern that is influenced by multiple genetic and environmental factors, similar to schizophrenia, which is also thought to have a polygenic basis and shows higher prevalence in families without following a strict Mendelian inheritance pattern. In contrast, the other conditions listed, such as Alport syndrome and familial hypercholesterolemia, follow more defined inheritance patterns (such as X-linked or autosomal dominant).
Answer: (A) Schizophrenia

Question: A 74-year-old man presents to the emergency department by paramedics for slurred speech and weakness in the left arm and leg for 1 hour. The patient was playing with his grandson when the symptoms started and his wife immediately called an ambulance. There is no history of head trauma or recent surgery. The patient takes captopril for hypertension. The vital signs include: pulse 110/min, respiratory rate 22/min, and blood pressure 200/105 mm Hg. The physical examination shows that the patient is alert and conscious, but speech is impaired. Muscle strength is 0/5 in the left arm and leg and 5/5 in the right arm and leg. A non-contrast CT of the head shows no evidence of intracranial bleeding. The lab results are as follows:
Serum glucose 90 mg/dL
Sodium 140 mEq/L
Potassium 4.1 mEq/L
Chloride 100 mEq/L
Serum creatinine 1.3 mg/dL
Blood urea nitrogen 20 mg/dL
Cholesterol, total 240 mg/dL
HDL-cholesterol 38 mg/dL
LDL-cholesterol 100 mg/dL

Reticulocyte count 0.8%
Erythrocyte count 5.3 million/mm3
Platelet count 130,000/mm3
Partial thromboplastin time (aPTT)  30 sec
Prothrombin time (PT) 12 sec
Although he is within the time frame for the standard therapy of the most likely condition, the treatment cannot be started because of which of the following contraindications? (E) Age of 74 years (C) Cholesterol level of 240 mg/dL (D) Systolic blood pressure of 200 mm Hg (A) Creatinine level of 1.3 mg/dL (B) A platelet count of 130,000/mm3
Reason: The answer is (D) Systolic blood pressure of 200 mm Hg because elevated blood pressure, particularly severe hypertension like this case, is a contraindication for thrombolytic therapy in a patient with acute ischemic stroke. High blood pressure increases the risk of complications such as intracranial hemorrhage if thrombolytic treatment is administered.
Answer: (D) Systolic blood pressure of 200 mm Hg

Question: A 28-year-old G1P0 woman comes to the emergency department complaining that her water just broke. She reports irregular prenatal care due to her erratic schedule. She is also unsure of her gestational age but claims that her belly began to show shortly after she received her thyroidectomy for her Graves disease about 9 months ago. She denies any known fevers, chills, abnormal vaginal discharge/bleeding, or sexually transmitted infections. She develops frequent and regular contractions and subsequently goes into active labor. A fetus was later vaginally delivered with a fetal heart rate of 180 bpm. A neonatal physical examination demonstrates a lack of a sagittal cranial suture and an APGAR score of 8 and 8, at 1 and 5 minutes respectively. What findings would you expect in the baby? (D) Low hemoglobin (B) High levels of free T4 and total T3 (A) Group B streptococcus in blood (C) High thyroid-stimulating hormone (E) Pericardial effusion
Reason: The answer is (B) High levels of free T4 and total T3 because the mother has a history of Graves' disease, which is a form of hyperthyroidism. During pregnancy, this autoimmune condition can lead to the transfer of anti-TSH receptor antibodies to the fetus, resulting in fetal hyperthyroidism, characterized by elevated levels of thyroid hormones such as free T4 and total T3.
Answer: (B) High levels of free T4 and total T3

Let's analyze the information provided step by step.

1. **Symptoms and Signs**: The patient presents with headaches, palpitations, diaphoresis, anxiety, and weight loss. She has diffuse thyroid swelling (thyromegaly), fine tremors, and exhibits signs of hyperactivity (elevated pulse and respiratory rate).

2. **Laboratory Findings**: 
   - Elevated 24-hour urinary VMA and metanephrines suggest catecholamine excess, which is commonly associated with pheochromocytoma.
   - Elevated serum epinephrine indicates adrenal involvement.
   - Elevated calcitonin suggests medullary thyroid carcinoma, which is associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndromes.
   - Elevated parathormone and hypercalcemia suggest primary hyperparathyroidism, which can also be part of MEN syndromes.

3. **Diagnosis Consideration**:
   - **MEN 2A**: Characterized by medullary thyroid carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, and primary hyperparathyroidism.
   - **MEN 2B**: Similar to MEN 2A but also includes mucosal neuromas and a marfanoid habitus.
   - **MEN 1**: Involves pituitary tumors, hyperparathyroidism, and pancreatic endocrine tumors, which do not match the symptoms presented.
   - **Neurofibromatosis**: Primarily involves skin and nervous system tumors, not the endocrine symptoms described.
   - **Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome**: Involves hemangioblastomas, renal cell carcinoma, and pheochromocytomas, but does not typically present with medullary thyroid carcinoma.

Given the combination of symptoms (thyroid issues, catecholamine excess, and hyperparathyroidism), the most likely diagnosis is:

**Answer: (D) Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 2B**. 

This is because the patient exhibits features consistent with both pheochromocytoma and medullary thyroid carcinoma, which are hallmark components of MEN 2 syndromes.

Question: A 64-year-old homeless man comes to the emergency department with right ear pain and difficulty hearing for 2 weeks. Over the last 5 days, he has also noticed discharge from his right ear. He does not recall the last time he saw a physician. His temperature is 39.0°C (102.2°F), blood pressure is 153/92 mm Hg, pulse is 113/minute, and respirations are 18/minute. He appears dirty and is malodorous. Physical examination shows mild facial asymmetry with the right corner of his mouth lagging behind the left when the patient smiles. He experiences severe ear pain when the right auricle is pulled superiorly. On otoscopic examination, there is granulation tissue at the transition between the cartilaginous and the osseous part of the ear canal. Which of the following is most likely associated with this patient's condition? (B) Condylar degeneration (D) Streptococcus pneumoniae (C) Opacified mastoid air cells (A) Malignant epithelial growth of the external auditory canal (E) Elevated HBA1c
Reason: The answer should actually be (C) Opacified mastoid air cells, given the clinical context provided. This patient exhibits signs of complicated ear infection, likely leading to mastoiditis, which can cause opacification of the mastoid air cells on imaging. The presence of granulation tissue in the ear canal and facial asymmetry indicates the possibility of a serious infection that could be related to the underlying structure of the ear and surrounding areas. 

Elevated HbA1c suggests poor diabetes control, but it does not directly correlate with the specific ear condition described in this scenario. Therefore, without prior knowledge, one could deduce that symptoms and examination findings are indicative of an ear infection rather than metabolic issues associated with diabetes.
Answer: (E) Elevated HBA1c

Question: A 32-year-old woman is admitted to the hospital with headache, photophobia, vomiting without nausea, and fever, which have evolved over the last 12 hours. She was diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus at 30 years of age and is on immunosuppressive therapy, which includes oral methylprednisolone. She has received vaccinations—meningococcal and pneumococcal vaccination, as well as BCG. Her vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 125/70 mm Hg, heart rate 82/min, respiratory rate 15/min, and temperature 38.7°C (101.7°F). On examination, her GCS score is 15. Pulmonary, cardiac, and abdominal examinations are within normal limits. A neurologic examination does not reveal focal symptoms. Moderate neck stiffness and a positive Brudzinski’s sign are noted. Which of the following would you expect to note in a CSF sample? (B) Formation of a spiderweb clot in the collected CSF (D) Decrease in CSF protein level (E) Listeria monocytogenes growth in the CSF culture (A) Lymphocytic pleocytosis (C) Haemophilus influenzae growth is the CSF culture
Reason: The correct answer should actually be (A) Lymphocytic pleocytosis. Given the patient's symptoms of headache, photophobia, vomiting, fever, and neck stiffness, it is indicative of meningitis, likely viral or atypical bacterial, which typically presents with lymphocytic pleocytosis in the CSF. 

If you didn't know the answer beforehand, you could conclude that the presence of neck stiffness and a positive Brudzinski's sign suggests meningeal irritation, and based on known patterns of CSF findings in meningitis, lymphocytic pleocytosis would commonly be expected in this scenario rather than bacterial growth specific to Listeria monocytogenes.
Answer: (E) Listeria monocytogenes growth in the CSF culture

Question: A 29-year-old woman comes to the emergency room with a 4-day history of fever and worsening cough. She describes bringing up a purulent, yellow sputum when she coughs. The patient has a history of cystic fibrosis and works as an elementary school teacher. The patient’s temperature is 102.3°F (39.1°C), blood pressure is 113/73 mmHg, pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and oxygen saturation is 94% on room air. She is sitting up in bed and sweating. Physical exam reveals bilateral crackles and decreased breath sounds with a dullness to percussion in the right lung base. A chest radiograph is obtained and reveals a right lower lobe pneumonia. Which of the following is the most likely agent? (B) Influenza virus (E) Streptococcus pneumoniae (D) Staphylococcus aureus (C) Pseudomonas aeruginosa (A) Haemophilus influenzae
Reason: The correct answer is indeed (C) Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This patient has cystic fibrosis, which significantly predisposes individuals to lung infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa due to the thick, viscous mucus that supports bacterial growth and creates a favorable environment for this pathogen.

If I hadn't known the answer beforehand, I could deduce that the high prevalence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in patients with cystic fibrosis, particularly in cases of pneumonia characterized by purulent sputum and crackles during auscultation, points towards this organism as the most likely causative agent in this clinical scenario.
Answer: (C) Pseudomonas aeruginosa

Let's analyze the information step by step.

1. **Study Design**: The study compares young patients with myocardial infarction (MI) to healthy controls, focusing on educational status as a potential risk factor.

2. **Odds Ratio**: An odds ratio (OR) of 2.1 suggests that individuals with low educational status are more than twice as likely to have an MI compared to those with high educational status.

3. **Confidence Interval**: The confidence interval (CI) for the odds ratio is 0.9 to 9.7. This range includes 1.0, which indicates that the association is not statistically significant. A CI that includes 1 means that we cannot rule out the possibility that there is no association.

4. **Statistical Significance**: Since the confidence interval includes 1, we conclude that the association between low education and the risk of MI is not statistically significant.

5. **Risk Factor Conclusion**: Although the odds ratio suggests a potential association (OR > 1), the lack of statistical significance (due to the CI including 1) means we cannot definitively say that low education is a risk factor.

Based on this analysis, the most appropriate inference is:

**(A) The association is not statistically significant, and low education is not a risk factor.**

Question: A 44-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of a 10-hour history of severe nausea and abdominal pain that began 30 minutes after eating dinner. The pain primarily is in her right upper quadrant and occasionally radiates to her back. She has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypercholesterolemia. Current medications include metformin and atorvastatin. She is 163 cm (5 ft 4 in) tall and weighs 91 kg (200 lb); BMI is 34 kg/m2. Her temperature is 38.8°C (101.8°F), pulse is 100/min, respirations are 14/min, and blood pressure is 150/76 mm Hg. Abdominal examination shows right upper quadrant tenderness with guarding. A bedside ultrasound shows a gall bladder wall measuring 6 mm, pericholecystic fluid, sloughing of the intraluminal membrane, and a 2 x 2-cm stone at the neck of the gallbladder. The common bile duct appears unremarkable. Laboratory studies show leukocytosis and normal liver function tests. Intravenous fluids are started, and she is given ketorolac for pain control. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? (B) Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (A) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast (E) Elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy in 6 weeks (C) Antibiotic therapy (D) Emergent open cholecystectomy
Reason: The most appropriate next step in managing this patient is (C) Antibiotic therapy. She is presenting with signs of acute cholecystitis, evidenced by her right upper quadrant pain, fever, leukocytosis, and ultrasound findings of gallbladder inflammation and stones. While surgical intervention (like cholecystectomy) may ultimately be required, initial management includes stabilizing the patient with antibiotics to address the infection before any surgical procedure is done.

Question: During an experiment, an investigator attempts to determine the rates of apoptosis in various tissue samples. Injecting cytotoxic T cells into the cell culture of one of the samples causes the tissue cells to undergo apoptosis. Apoptosis is most likely due to secretion of which of the following substances in this case? (C) TNF-α (A) Cytochrome C (B) Bcl-2 (D) Granzyme B (E) Caspases
Reason: The apoptosis induced in the tissue cells after injecting cytotoxic T cells is most likely due to the secretion of (D) Granzyme B. Granzyme B is a serine protease released by cytotoxic T cells that enters target cells and activates apoptotic pathways by cleaving and activating caspases, leading to cell death. This mechanism is a key component of the immune response, allowing T cells to eliminate infected or malignant cells effectively.
Answer: (D) Granzyme B

Question: An investigator develops a new drug that decreases the number of voltage-gated potassium channels in cardiac muscle cell membranes. Which of the following is the most likely effect of this drug on the myocardial action potential? (E) Accelerated repolarization (B) Accelerated depolarization (C) Delayed repolarization (D) Delayed depolarization (A) Decreased resting membrane potential
Reason: The most likely effect of the drug that decreases the number of voltage-gated potassium channels in cardiac muscle cell membranes is (C) Delayed repolarization. Potassium channels are crucial for repolarizing the membrane potential during the action potential phase by allowing potassium ions to exit the cell; reducing their numbers would hinder this process, prolonging the repolarization phase and potentially leading to extended action potentials.
Answer: (C) Delayed repolarization

Let's analyze the information provided step by step to determine the most likely diagnosis.

1. **Patient Presentation**: The patient is a 26-year-old woman involved in a high-speed motor vehicle collision. She is lethargic, incoherent, in respiratory distress, and has severe facial lacerations.

2. **Vital Signs**: Her pulse is elevated (130/min), respirations are rapid (29/min), and blood pressure is low (90/58 mm Hg). This suggests possible shock.

3. **Oxygen Saturation**: The pulse oximetry shows an oxygen saturation of 70%, indicating significant hypoxemia.

4. **Physical Examination**: 
   - Dullness to percussion and decreased breath sounds over the left lung base suggest fluid or air in the pleural space.
   - Abdominal examination shows diffuse tenderness but no guarding or rebound, which may indicate internal injury but not acute abdomen.

5. **Imaging Findings**: 
   - Chest x-ray shows a fractured left second rib, depression of the left mainstem bronchus, deviation of the nasogastric tube to the right, and a widened mediastinum.

6. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **(E) Tension pneumothorax**: This would typically present with tracheal deviation away from the affected side and hyper-resonance on percussion, which is not indicated here.
   - **(A) Diaphragmatic rupture**: This could cause bowel sounds in the thorax but is less likely given the other findings.
   - **(C) Thoracic aortic rupture**: The widened mediastinum and the mechanism of injury are suggestive, and it can lead to rapid hemodynamic instability.
   - **(B) Traumatic bronchial rupture**: This could explain respiratory distress and hypoxemia, but the imaging findings are more consistent with aortic injury.
   - **(D) Cardiac tamponade**: This would typically present with muffled heart sounds, jugular venous distension, and hypotension, which are not described here.

Given the mechanism of injury, the presence of a widened mediastinum, and the other findings, the most likely diagnosis is:

**Answer: (C) Thoracic aortic rupture**.

Question: A 27-year-old man interested in pre-exposure therapy for HIV (PrEP) is being evaluated to qualify for a PrEP study. In order to qualify, patients must be HIV- and hepatitis B- and C-negative. Any other sexually transmitted infections require treatment prior to initiation of PrEP. The medical history is positive for a prior syphilis infection and bipolar affective disorder, for which he takes lithium. On his next visit, the liver and renal enzymes are within normal ranges. HIV and hepatitis B and C tests are negative. Which of the following about the HIV test is true? (A) It is a quantitative test used for screening purposes. (C) An unknown antigen binds to the known serum. (D) A known antigen binds to the patient’s serum. (B) It is a qualitative test used for screening purposes. (E) A secondary reagent is needed to interpret the results.
Reason: The correct answer is that the HIV test is a qualitative test used for screening purposes (B). This is because initial HIV tests are designed to determine the presence or absence of HIV antibodies or antigens in the blood, which provides a yes/no result, rather than measuring the quantity of the virus, which would be a quantitative test.
Answer: (B) It is a qualitative test used for screening purposes.

Question: A 41-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of anxiety, difficulty falling asleep, heat intolerance, and a 6-kg (13.2-lb) weight loss. The patient's nephew, who is studying medicine, mentioned that her symptoms might be caused by a condition that is due to somatic activating mutations of the genes for the TSH receptor. Examination shows warm, moist skin and a 2-cm, nontender, subcutaneous mass on the anterior neck. Which of the following additional findings should most raise concern for a different underlying etiology of her symptoms? (C) Hyperreflexia (D) Lid lag (E) Fine tremor (B) Atrial fibrillation (A) Nonpitting edema
Reason: The correct answer is (A) Nonpitting edema. Nonpitting edema is not a common finding in hyperthyroid conditions; rather, it is typically associated with hypothyroidism, particularly in conditions like myxedema. Therefore, its presence in this patient could suggest an underlying thyroid disorder or a different etiology that needs further investigation, contrasting with the other options that align more closely with hyperthyroid symptoms.
Answer: (A) Nonpitting edema

Let's analyze the situation step by step.

1. **Patient's Symptoms**: The patient has dyspnea on exertion, elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP), and bilateral lower extremity edema. These symptoms suggest heart failure or fluid overload.

2. **Mechanism of Edema**: Edema in the lower extremities can occur due to several mechanisms, but in the context of heart failure, the most common cause is an increase in capillary hydrostatic pressure. This occurs when the heart is unable to pump effectively, leading to fluid backing up in the venous system and increased pressure in the capillaries, which causes fluid to leak into the interstitial space.

3. **Options Analysis**:
   - (D) Increase in colloid osmotic pressure: This would typically decrease edema, not cause it.
   - (B) Decrease in plasma proteins: This can cause edema but is less likely in this context since the patient has a history of myocardial infarction and likely has normal protein levels.
   - (A) Increase in capillary pressure: This is consistent with heart failure and is the most likely explanation for the edema.
   - (E) Increase in interstitial fluid pressure: This is a consequence of edema, not a cause.
   - (C) Increase in capillary permeability: This is more associated with inflammatory processes, not typically with heart failure.

Based on this analysis, the most likely explanation for this patient's lower extremity edema is:

**Answer: (A) Increase in capillary pressure.**

Question: A 68-year-old right hand-dominant man presents to the emergency room complaining of severe right arm pain after falling down a flight of stairs. He landed on his shoulder and developed immediate severe upper arm pain. Physical examination reveals a 2-cm laceration in the patient’s anterior right upper arm. Bone is visible through the laceration. An arm radiograph demonstrates a displaced comminuted fracture of the surgical neck of the humerus. Irrigation and debridement is performed immediately and the patient is scheduled to undergo definitive operative management of his fracture. In the operating room on the following day, the operation is more complicated than expected and the surgeon accidentally nicks a neurovascular structure piercing the coracobrachialis muscle. This patient would most likely develop a defect in which of the following? (E) Wrist extension (B) Forearm pronation (A) Elbow extension (C) Lateral forearm skin sensation (D) Medial arm skin sensation
Reason: The correct answer is (C) Lateral forearm skin sensation. If the neurovascular structure that was nicked is the musculocutaneous nerve, it would result in a loss of sensation in the lateral aspect of the forearm, as this nerve innervates the skin of that area. This nerve is also responsible for motor function to muscles involved in elbow flexion, but since the question specifically asks about sensation, option (C) is the most appropriate response.
Answer: (C) Lateral forearm skin sensation

Question: A 51-year-old homeless man presents to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain and cramping for the past 3 hours. He endorses radiation to his back. He adds that he vomited multiple times. He admits having been hospitalized repeatedly for alcohol intoxication and abdominal pain. His temperature is 103.8° F (39.8° C), respiratory rate is 15/min, pulse is 107/min, and blood pressure is 100/80 mm Hg. He refuses a physical examination due to severe pain. Blood work reveals the following:
Serum:    
  Albumin: 3.2 gm/dL
  Alkaline phosphatase: 150 U/L
  Alanine aminotransferase: 76 U/L
  Aspartate aminotransferase: 155 U/L
  Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase: 202 U/L
  Lipase: 800 U/L
What is the most likely diagnosis of this patient? (B) Pancreatitis (D) Duodenal peptic ulcer (C) Choledocholithiasis (E) Gallbladder cancer (A) Cholecystitis
Reason: The correct answer is (B) Pancreatitis. The high level of lipase (800 U/L), along with the patient's severe abdominal pain that radiates to the back, history of alcohol use, and elevated liver enzymes, suggests acute pancreatitis. These findings are consistent with a pancreatic injury or inflammation that is often triggered by factors such as alcohol consumption or gallstones.

Question: A 59-year-old man presents with the persistent right-sided facial droop and slurred speech for the past 2 hours. He says he had similar symptoms 6 months ago which resolved within 1 hour. His past medical history is significant for long-standing hypertension, managed with hydrochlorothiazide. He reports a 10-pack-year smoking history but denies any alcohol or recreational drug use. The vital signs include: blood pressure 145/95 mm Hg, pulse 95/min, and respiratory rate 18/min. On physical examination, the patient has an asymmetric smile and right-sided weakness of his lower facial muscles. There is a deviation of his tongue towards the right. Dysarthria is noted. His muscle strength in the upper extremities is 4/5 on the right and 5/5 on the left. The remainder of the physical exam is unremarkable. Which of the following is the next most appropriate step in the management of this patient? (A) CT of the head without contrast (E) IV tPA (D) CT angiography of the brain (C) T1/T2 MRI of the head (B) CT of the head with contrast
Reason: The correct answer is (A) CT of the head without contrast. Given the patient's symptoms of a sudden onset right-sided facial droop and weakness, along with a history of transient neurological symptoms (suggestive of a transient ischemic attack), it is essential to rule out an acute intracranial hemorrhage or other structural abnormalities before considering thrombolysis with IV tPA. A non-contrast CT scan of the head is the standard initial imaging modality in acute stroke evaluation to quickly identify any bleeding or other acute changes.
Answer: (A) CT of the head without contrast

Let's analyze the information provided step by step.

The patient is a 32-year-old woman presenting with a grape-like mass protruding from her vagina, which is suggestive of a molar pregnancy (gestational trophoblastic disease). The absence of fetal heart sounds and the enlarged uterus (fundus at the level of the umbilicus) further support this diagnosis.

In cases of complete hydatidiform moles, the genotype is typically 46XX (from the maternal side) or 46XY (from the paternal side, if it is a partial mole). However, in the case of a complete mole, the most common genotype is 46XX, which arises from the fertilization of an empty ovum by a sperm that duplicates its genetic material.

Given the options:
- (B) 45XO: This is Turner syndrome, which is not relevant here.
- (A) 69XXY: This indicates a triploid condition, which can occur in partial moles but is not the most common finding in complete moles.
- (C) 23XX: This does not represent a viable genotype.
- (E) 46XX: This is the typical genotype for a complete hydatidiform mole.
- (D) 47XYY: This is not relevant to the case.

Based on the information provided, the most likely genotype of the substance that will be aspirated by dilation and evacuation in this case is:

Question: A 35-year-old female presents to her PCP at the request of her husband after 3 weeks of erratic behavior. The patient has been staying up all night online shopping on eBay. Despite a lack of sleep, she is "full of energy" during the day at her teaching job, which she believes is "beneath [her], anyway." She has not sought psychiatric treatment in the past, but reports an episode of self-diagnosed depression 2 years ago. The patient denies thoughts of suicide. Pregnancy test is negative. Which of the following is the best initial treatment? (E) Electroconvulsive therapy (C) Valproate and olanzapine (B) Valproate and venlafaxine (A) Valproate (D) Haloperidol
Reason: The patient's symptoms suggest a manic episode, likely indicative of bipolar disorder, particularly given the erratic behavior, increased energy, reduced need for sleep, and grandiosity. The combination of valproate (a mood stabilizer) and olanzapine (an atypical antipsychotic) is commonly used for the acute treatment of mania, making it the best initial treatment option for this patient.

Question: A 77-year-old woman presents to her physician because of fatigue and progressive dyspnea despite receiving optimal treatment for heart failure. Her medical history is positive for heart failure, active tuberculosis, and chronic renal failure, for which she has been in long-term hemodialysis (13 years). The woman currently takes rifampin and isoniazid. Her physical exam shows the presence of hepatomegaly (a jugular venous distention that fails to subside on inspiration) and an impalpable apical impulse. Her pulse is 122/min, respiratory rate 16/min, temperature 36.0°C (97.4°F), and blood pressure 120/60 mm Hg. Her cardiac monitor shows a prominent y descent in her jugular venous pulse. A cardiac ultrasound shows pericardial calcifications and small tubular-shaped ventricles. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient’s current condition? (E) Restrictive cardiomyopathy (D) Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (C) Dilated cardiomyopathy (A) Atrial fibrillation (B) Constrictive pericarditis
Reason: The patient's history of long-term hemodialysis, tuberculosis, and the findings of pericardial calcifications suggest constrictive pericarditis as the most likely cause of her symptoms. The prominent y descent in the jugular venous pulse and the presence of hepatomegaly further support this diagnosis, as these are characteristic signs of impaired filling of the heart due to constriction of the pericardium.

Question: A 74-year-old Hispanic man comes to the physician because of a three-week history of dizziness upon standing and a brief loss of consciousness one hour ago. The patient suddenly collapsed on his way to the bathroom after waking up in the morning. He did not sustain any injuries from his collapse. He has a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and gout. The patient's mother died of a grand mal seizure at the age of 53 years. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 55 years. He drinks three beers and two glasses of whiskey daily. Current medications include ranitidine, dutasteride, tamsulosin, and allopurinol. He is 166 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 62 kg (137 lb); BMI is 22.5 kg/m2. He appears pale. Temperature is 36.7°C (98.0°F), pulse is 83/min, and blood pressure is 125/80 mm Hg supine and 100/70 mm Hg one minute after standing with no change in pulse rate. Physical examination shows conjunctival pallor. A plopping sound is heard on auscultation, immediately followed by a low-pitched, rumbling mid-diastolic murmur heard best at the apex. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. An ECG shows regular sinus rhythm. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? (E) Grand mal seizure (C) Infective endocarditis (A) Cardiac myxoma (B) Aortic valve stenosis (D) Drug-induced hypotension
Reason: The patient's symptoms, including dizziness upon standing, brief loss of consciousness, pallor, and the unique plopping sound followed by a low-pitched mid-diastolic murmur heard best at the apex, suggest the presence of a cardiac myxoma. This murmur is characteristic of left atrial myxomas, which can cause obstruction of blood flow and lead to syncope and other systemic symptoms due to their potential to disrupt normal circulation.
Answer: (A) Cardiac myxoma

Question: A 29-year-old nulligravid woman comes to the physician because of a 10-day history of small quantities of intermittent, blood-tinged discharge from her left nipple. There is no personal or family history of serious illness. She has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for 5 years. Her last menstrual period was 12 days ago. She is sexually active and uses condoms inconsistently. Physical examination shows scant serosanguinous fluid expressible from the left nipple. There is no palpable breast mass or axillary lymphadenopathy. Examination shows no other abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? (E) Reassurance (D) Breast MRI (A) Subareolar ultrasound (B) Image-guided core biopsy of the affected duct (C) Nipple discharge cytology
Reason: The answer is (A) Subareolar ultrasound. In cases of unilateral nipple discharge, particularly when the discharge is blood-tinged and the patient is young and nulligravid, a subareolar ultrasound is an appropriate first step to evaluate for underlying pathologies, such as intraductal lesions or other abnormalities, especially before committing to more invasive procedures. This non-invasive imaging helps to assess the ductal system and directs further management based on the findings.

Let's analyze the question step by step.

The patient has a penetrating gunshot wound at the level of L3. At this level, we need to consider the major vascular structures that could be affected.

1. **Inferior Vena Cava (IVC)**: The IVC runs along the right side of the vertebral column and is located at the level of L3. A penetrating injury at this level could potentially injure the IVC.

2. **Renal Artery**: The renal arteries branch off the abdominal aorta at the level of L1-L2, so they are less likely to be directly injured by a wound at L3.

3. **Internal Iliac Artery and Vein**: The internal iliac vessels branch off the common iliac vessels, which are located at the level of L4. While they could be affected, they are not as directly at risk as the IVC.

4. **Portal Vein**: The portal vein is located more anteriorly and is not typically at risk from a wound at L3.

Given this analysis, the most likely vascular structure that could be injured by a gunshot wound at the level of L3 is the **Inferior Vena Cava (IVC)**.

Therefore, the answer is:
**(A) Inferior vena cava**.

Question: A 13-year-old girl is brought to a medical clinic with a complaint of a left foot deformity since birth. The clinical and radiologic evaluation suggested partial simple syndactyly between the 2nd and 3rd toes of the left foot. A radiograph revealed a bony fusion between the proximal phalanges of the 2nd and 3rd toes. There are no other congenital defects except for the toe findings. A failure in which of the following processes could lead to deformity as shown in the picture? (D) Phagocytosis (C) Opsonization (A) Chemotaxis (E) Apoptosis (B) Necrosis
Reason: The correct answer is (E) Apoptosis because syndactyly, which involves the fusion of digits, can occur due to a failure of programmed cell death (apoptosis) during embryonic development. In normal development, apoptosis helps to separate tissues and structures such as fingers and toes; when this process is disrupted, it can lead to congenital deformities like syndactyly.

Question: A 55-year-old man is brought to the emergency department for the evaluation of severe chest pain for the last hour. The pain travels along the left arm and upper jaw. The patient also reports difficulty breathing and profuse sweating. He has hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for the last 35 years. His medications include enalapril and metformin. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 110/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg. An ECG shows ST elevation in the leads II, III, and aVF. Morphine is administered and oxygen supplementation and fluid resuscitation are begun. Shortly after, the patient becomes unstable. Following emergency resuscitation and stabilization, a written advance directive provided by the patient's primary care physician shows a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order. The patient's wife, who is the power of attorney, disagrees. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management of this patient? (D) Contact the patient's oldest child (B) Supportive care only (C) Reperform resuscitation when needed (E) Contact the ethics committee (A) Obtain court order to revoke written advance directive
Reason: The correct answer is (B) Supportive care only because the presence of a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order indicates that the patient, while capable, had previously expressed a desire not to receive resuscitative measures in the event of a medical emergency. Given the advanced directive's legal standing, supportive care should be provided to respect the patient’s wishes, and additional interventions such as emergency resuscitation would not align with the directive, even if family members disagree.

Her friend said that she has been out late either studying for upcoming tests or attending prayer group meetings. As far as the friend can recollect, the patient appeared to be in her usual state of health until only two days ago, when she was prescribed trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection. The patient complained that the medication was making her feel nauseous and bloated. The patient also relies on glargine and lispro for glycemic control. Her temperature is 100.5°F (38.1°C), blood pressure is 95/55 mmHg, pulse is 130/min, and respirations are 30/min. Her pupils are equal and reactive to light bilaterally. The remainder of the physical exam is unremarkable. Her basic metabolic panel is displayed below:

Which of the following is true regarding this patient's presentation? (D) Azotemia independently contributes to the patient's encephalopathy (A) Hyponatremia is independently associated with a poor prognosis (B) Hyperkalemia is independent of the patient's total body potassium stores (E) Hypochloremia to this magnitude supports a pure anion-gap metabolic acidosis (C) Hyperglycemia to this magnitude supports hyperglycemic hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome
Reason: The correct answer is (B) Hyperkalemia is independent of the patient's total body potassium stores because in the setting of severe hyperglycemia, as seen in this patient, insulin deficiency can lead to a shift of potassium out of cells, resulting in transient hyperkalemia despite potentially normal or low total body potassium stores. This is common in diabetic emergencies, where acidosis and hyperglycemia play critical roles in potassium distribution, leading to increased serum potassium levels without necessarily indicating an excess of potassium in the body.

Let's analyze the case step by step. The patient presents with symptoms of dry mouth and dry eyes, which are characteristic of Sjögren's syndrome, an autoimmune condition. The presence of anti-Ro (SSA) and anti-La (SSB) autoantibodies further supports this diagnosis. 

Patients with Sjögren's syndrome are at an increased risk for certain complications, particularly lymphoproliferative disorders. Among the options provided, non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a well-known complication associated with Sjögren's syndrome. 

While other cancers may have associations with autoimmune diseases, the most significant risk factor in this context is the development of non-Hodgkin lymphoma due to the chronic inflammation and immune dysregulation seen in Sjögren's syndrome.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**(B) Non-Hodgkin lymphoma**.

Question: A 78-year-old female presents to her primary care provider complaining of shaking of her hands. She reports that her hands shake when she is pouring her coffee in the morning and when she is buttoning her shirt. She has noticed that her tremor improves with the several beers she has every night with dinner. She has a past medical history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, moderate persistent asthma, acute intermittent porphyria, and urinary retention. Her home medications include hydrochlorothiazide, warfarin, bethanechol, low-dose inhaled fluticasone, and an albuterol inhaler as needed. On physical exam, she has an irregularly irregular heart rhythm without S3/S4. She has mild wheezing on pulmonary exam. She has no tremor when her hands are in her lap. A low-amplitude tremor is present during finger-to-nose testing. Her neurological exam is otherwise unremarkable.

Which of the following is a contraindication to the first-line treatment of this condition? (C) Heavy alcohol use (B) Asthma (D) Urinary retention (E) Warfarin use (A) Acute intermittent porphyria
Reason: The answer is (B) Asthma. The primary treatment for essential tremor, a condition suggested by this patient's presentation, is typically a beta-blocker such as propranolol. Beta-blockers can induce bronchospasm, which is particularly concerning in patients with asthma, making asthma a contraindication for this treatment option.

Question: A 1-day-old infant born at full term by uncomplicated spontaneous vaginal delivery is noted to have cyanosis of the oral mucosa. The baby otherwise appears comfortable. On examination, his respiratory rate is 40/min and pulse oximetry is 80%. His left thumb is displaced and hypoplastic. A right ventricular lift is palpated, S1 is normal, S2 is single, and a harsh 3/6 systolic ejection murmur is heard at the left upper sternal border. Chest X-ray is shown. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? (C) Ventricular septal defect (E) Pneumothorax (B) Tetralogy of Fallot (D) Transient tachypnoea of the newborn (A) Transposition of great vessels
Reason: The answer is (B) Tetralogy of Fallot. The combination of cyanosis, a single S2 heart sound, and a harsh systolic ejection murmur suggests a right ventricular outflow obstruction consistent with Tetralogy of Fallot. The presence of a hypoplastic and displaced left thumb may also indicate associated anomalies commonly seen in congenital heart defects.

Question: A 55-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-week history of intermittent burning epigastric pain. His pain improves with antacid use and eating but returns approximately 2 hours following meals. He has a history of chronic osteoarthritis and takes ibuprofen daily. Upper endoscopy shows a deep ulcer located on the posterior wall of the duodenal bulb. This ulcer is most likely to erode into which of the following structures? (D) Gastroduodenal artery (B) Pancreatic duct (A) Splenic vein (E) Transverse colon (C) Descending aorta
Reason: The answer is (D) Gastroduodenal artery. A deep ulcer located on the posterior wall of the duodenal bulb has a high risk of eroding into the gastroduodenal artery, as this artery runs closely behind the duodenum. The patient's history of ibuprofen use further supports the presence of a peptic ulcer, which is often associated with erosion into nearby vascular structures, particularly arteries.
Answer: (D) Gastroduodenal artery

Let's analyze the case step by step.

1. **Patient Presentation**: The 35-year-old woman has intermittent episodes of heart palpitations, sharp chest pain localized to the left 3rd intercostal space, and a nervous appearance. She has a pulse of 110/min that is irregularly irregular, which suggests atrial fibrillation. 

2. **Physical Exam Findings**: 
   - Fine tremor in both hands: This could indicate hyperthyroidism.
   - Digital swelling: This could suggest a thyroid-related condition, such as Graves' disease.
   - Retraction of the left upper eyelid: This is a classic sign of Graves' disease (exophthalmos).
   - Systolic ejection murmur along the right upper sternal border: This could indicate aortic stenosis or flow-related murmur, but in the context of hyperthyroidism, it may be due to increased cardiac output.

3. **Warm extremities and 2+ pulses**: These findings suggest good perfusion, which is consistent with hyperthyroidism.

4. **Diagnosis**: The combination of symptoms (palpitations, tremor, eyelid retraction) and the irregularly irregular pulse strongly suggests that the patient has atrial fibrillation secondary to hyperthyroidism (likely Graves' disease).

5. **Pharmacotherapy**: In patients with atrial fibrillation, especially when there is a hyperthyroid state, the first-line treatment to control the heart rate is typically a beta-blocker. Propranolol is effective in controlling heart rate and also has the added benefit of helping to manage symptoms of hyperthyroidism.

Given this analysis, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient is:

**Answer: (A) Propranolol**

Question: A 62-year-old man presents for evaluation of an adrenal nodule, which was accidentally discovered while performing a computerized tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen for recurrent abdominal pain. The CT was negative except for a 3 cm low-density, well-circumscribed nodule in the left adrenal gland. He reports weight gain of 12 kg (26.4 lb) over the past 3 years. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension, which have been difficult to control with medications. Which of the following is the best initial test for this patient? (C) 1 mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test (D) Pituitary magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (B) CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis (E) Inferior petrosal sampling (A) ACTH stimulation test
Reason: The 1 mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test is the best initial test for this patient because it is used to evaluate for Cushing's syndrome, which may explain his weight gain, hypertension, and difficulty controlling diabetes. Given the presence of an adrenal nodule and the clinical signs suggestive of hypercortisolism, this test helps determine whether the adrenal gland is producing excess cortisol.
Answer: (C) 1 mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test

Question: An investigator is studying the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen in different clinical settings. An illustration of an oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve is shown. Curve A shows the test results of one of the research participants and curve B shows a normal oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve. Which of the following is most likely present in this research participant? (D) Serum pH of 7.1 (E) Polycythemia (C) Neutrophilia (A) Temperature of 39.1°C (102.4°F) (B) Sickled red blood cells
Reason: The reasoning for choosing polycythemia as the correct answer is that polycythemia increases the concentration of red blood cells in the bloodstream, which can lead to a leftward shift in the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve. This shift indicates a higher affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen, allowing for more efficient oxygen pickup in the lungs, which may differ from the normal curve represented by curve B.
Answer: (E) Polycythemia

Let's analyze the options step by step.

The question is about the reason for conjugating capsular polysaccharides to protein carriers in vaccine development, particularly for bacteria like Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib).

1. **Understanding the Role of Protein Carriers**: Capsular polysaccharides are typically T cell-independent antigens, meaning they do not elicit a strong immune response on their own, especially in infants. By conjugating these polysaccharides to a protein carrier, the immune response can be enhanced.

2. **Immune Response**: The conjugation allows the polysaccharide to be presented to T cells, which in turn helps stimulate a more robust immune response, including the production of IgG antibodies. This is particularly important for infants, who may not respond adequately to polysaccharide-only vaccines.

3. **Evaluating the Options**:
   - (B) Conjugation with a protein carrier generates IgM dominant antibody responses: This is incorrect; the goal is to generate IgG responses.
   - (C) Polysaccharides conjugated with proteins are T cell-independent antigens: This is incorrect; conjugation makes them T cell-dependent.
   - (E) Conjugation with a protein carrier provides effective protection to infants: This is true, but it doesn't directly address the mechanism of why conjugation is done.
   - (A) Conjugation with a protein carrier generates IgG2 dominant antibody responses: This is a strong candidate because it highlights the type of immune response generated.
   - (D) Conjugation with a protein carrier improves vaccine stability: While this may be a benefit, it is not the primary reason for conjugation in the context of immune response.

Given this analysis, the best response to the medical student's question is:

**Answer: (A) Conjugation with a protein carrier generates IgG2 dominant antibody responses.**

Question: A 63-year-old man who recently immigrated to the United States from Indonesia comes to the physician because of worsening shortness of breath and swollen extremities for the past 3 months. He has had a 4-kg (8.8-lb) weight loss and intermittent fevers over the last 6 months. Examination shows pitting pedal edema and abdominal distension. Abdominal pressure over the right upper quadrant produces persistent distention of the jugular veins. An x-ray of the chest shows cavernous infiltrates in the left and right-upper lobes and a calcified cardiac silhouette. Cardiovascular examination is most likely to show which of the following? (C) Fourth heart sound (A) Absent jugular venous pulse y descent (B) Pericardial knock (E) Fixed split second heart sound (D) Pulsus parvus et tardus
Reason: The answer is (B) Pericardial knock because the patient’s symptoms and findings, including the history of weight loss, shortness of breath, abdominal distension, and persistent distention of jugular veins, suggest constrictive pericarditis, which typically presents with a pericardial knock during heart examination. This sound is a result of the stiff pericardium abruptly halting ventricular filling in early diastole, which aligns with the patient's signs of heart strain and volume overload.
Answer: (B) Pericardial knock

Question: A 5-year-old boy presents to his pediatrician along with his parents due to episodes of “staring into space.” This symptom occurs several times a day and lasts only a few seconds. During these episodes, the boy does not respond to verbal or physical stimulation, and his parents deny him falling down or shaking. After the episode, the boy returns to his normal activity and is not confused. The parents deny any history of head trauma, recent medication use, or infection. Neurological exam is unremarkable. His episode is precipitated as he blows at a pinwheel. An EEG is performed, which shows 3-Hz spike and waveform. Which of the following is the best treatment option for this patient? (B) Levetiracetam (A) Ethosuximide (D) Valproic acid (E) Zonisamide (C) Lamotrigine
Reason: The answer is (A) Ethosuximide because the clinical presentation is characteristic of absence seizures, which typically present as brief episodes of staring, unresponsiveness, and normal recovery without confusion. Ethosuximide is the first-line treatment specifically indicated for absence seizures, as it effectively targets the underlying mechanisms of these types of seizures without significant side effects compared to other antiepileptic medications.
Answer: (A) Ethosuximide

Question: A 4-year-old boy is brought to the physician for the evaluation of fatigue since he returned from visiting family in South Africa one week ago. The day after he returned, he had fever, chills, and diffuse joint pain for 3 days. His symptoms improved with acetaminophen. He was born at term and has been healthy. His immunizations are up-to-date. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.68°F), pulse is 100/min, and blood pressure is 100/60 mm Hg. Examination shows conjunctival pallor. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show:
Hemoglobin 10.8 g/dL
Mean corpuscular volume 68 μm3
Red cell distribution width 14% (N = 13%–15%)
Hemoglobin A2 6% (N < 3.5%)
A peripheral smear shows microcytic, hypochromic erythrocytes, some of which have a darkly stained center and peripheral rim, separated by a pale ring. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?" (B) Oral succimer (C) Reassurance (E) Iron supplementation (A) Folic acid therapy (D) Oral pyridoxine
Reason: The answer is (C) Reassurance because the laboratory findings indicate microcytic, hypochromic anemia with an elevated hemoglobin A2 level, which is consistent with beta-thalassemia trait rather than iron deficiency anemia. In cases of beta-thalassemia trait, the condition is typically asymptomatic and does not require treatment, thus the appropriate management is reassurance to the family that the child's anemia is a benign condition and does not require intervention.
Answer: (C) Reassurance

Let's analyze the situation step by step.

1. **Patient Background**: The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of diabetes and poorly controlled hypertension. He is currently on enalapril (an ACE inhibitor) and metformin (for diabetes).

2. **Blood Pressure**: His blood pressure is still elevated at 155/90 mmHg, indicating that his hypertension is not well controlled.

3. **New Medication**: The physician adds another antihypertensive medication to his regimen.

4. **Follow-Up Symptoms**: One month later, the patient presents with new onset lower extremity swelling (edema).

5. **Medication Options**:
   - (A) Metoprolol: A beta-blocker, which typically does not cause peripheral edema.
   - (B) Verapamil: A calcium channel blocker that can cause peripheral edema but is less commonly used as a first-line agent for hypertension.
   - (C) Nifedipine: A dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker that is known to cause peripheral edema as a side effect.
   - (D) Hydrochlorothiazide: A thiazide diuretic, which can cause electrolyte imbalances but is less likely to cause peripheral edema.
   - (E) Spironolactone: A potassium-sparing diuretic that can cause some fluid retention but is not typically associated with significant peripheral edema.

6. **Conclusion**: Given that the patient developed lower extremity swelling after the addition of a new antihypertensive medication, the most likely medication prescribed is **(C) Nifedipine**, as it is known to cause peripheral edema as a common side effect.

**Answer: (C) Nifedipine**

Question: A 16-year-old boy is brought to the physician for a follow-up appointment. He has a seizure disorder treated with valproic acid. He has always had difficulties with his schoolwork. He was able to walk independently at the age of 2 years and was able to use a fork and spoon at the age of 3 years. Ophthalmic examination shows hyperpigmented iris nodules bilaterally. A photograph of his skin examination findings is shown. This patient is at increased risk for which of the following conditions? (C) Pheochromocytoma (A) Vestibular schwannoma (D) Leptomeningeal angioma (B) Hemangioblastoma (E) Cardiac rhabdomyoma
Reason: The answer is (C) Pheochromocytoma because the presence of bilateral hyperpigmented iris nodules (Lisch nodules) and the history of a seizure disorder suggest a diagnosis of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). NF1 is associated with an increased risk of various tumors, including pheochromocytomas, which are adrenal tumors that can result in excessive catecholamine production.
Answer: (C) Pheochromocytoma

Question: A 47-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department by her husband with the complaints of severe abdominal pain and discomfort. The pain began 2 days earlier, she describes it as radiating to her back and is associated with nausea. Her past medical history is significant for similar episodes of pain after fatty meals that resolved on its own. She drinks socially and has a 15 pack-year smoking history. Her pulse is 121/min, blood pressure is 121/71 mm Hg, and her temperature is 103.1°F (39.5°C). She has tenderness in the right upper quadrant and epigastrium with guarding and rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds are hypoactive. Part of a CBC is given below. What is the next best step in the management of this patient?
Hb%: 11 gm/dL
Total count (WBC): 13,400/mm3
Differential count:
Neutrophils: 80%
Lymphocytes: 15%
Monocytes: 5%
ESR: 45 mm/hr
C-reactive protein: 9.9 mg/dL (Normal < 3.0 mg/dL) (A) Ultrasound of the appendix (B) Erect abdominal X-ray (D) Upper GI endoscopy (E) Serum lipase levels (C) Ultrasound of the gallbladder
Reason: The answer is (C) Ultrasound of the gallbladder because the patient's clinical presentation—severe right upper quadrant pain, history of similar episodes after fatty meals, and signs of possible inflammation such as fever and elevated white blood cell count—suggests acute cholecystitis. An ultrasound of the gallbladder is the best initial imaging study to confirm this diagnosis and assess for gallstones or gallbladder inflammation.

Question: A 70-year-old man presents to the clinic with right-sided chest pain and difficulty breathing for the past 10 days. When it began, the pain was mild, but as time went on, it increased to a level at which the man found it difficult to breathe. Two years ago, he was diagnosed with clear cell carcinoma of the kidney. Vital signs include: pulse rate is 72/min, blood pressure is 122/80 mm Hg, respiratory rate is 16/min, and temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F). On physical examination, the trachea appears to have deviated to the left, respiratory movements are diminished, there is decreased resonance on percussion, and there is an absence of breath sounds over the right hemithorax. Which of the following is the most likely clinical diagnosis in this patient? (C) Pneumothorax (D) Pulmonary embolism (E) Pleural effusion (B) Atelectasis (A) Pneumonia
Reason: The answer is (E) Pleural effusion because the patient's symptoms of right-sided chest pain, difficulty breathing, tracheal deviation to the left, diminished respiratory movements, decreased resonance on percussion, and absence of breath sounds over the right hemithorax are consistent with fluid accumulation in the pleural space. These findings are typical for pleural effusion, especially in the context of a patient with a history of malignancy, which increases the likelihood of effusion due to cancer-related factors such as metastatic disease or paraneoplastic syndromes.
Answer: (E) Pleural effusion

Let's analyze the situation step by step. 

The patient is a 42-year-old man with type 1 diabetes mellitus who experiences symptoms suggestive of hypoglycemia during the night, such as excessive sweating, hand tremors, and weakness. These symptoms indicate that he may be experiencing nocturnal hypoglycemia, which can lead to high blood glucose levels in the morning due to the body's counter-regulatory response (the dawn phenomenon).

Given this context, the optimal intervention would be to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia. Since the patient is waking up with symptoms of hypoglycemia and has high morning blood glucose levels, it suggests that he may be taking too much insulin, especially if he is experiencing these symptoms at night.

Therefore, the most appropriate intervention would be:

(E) Reducing daily insulin dose

This approach would help prevent nocturnal hypoglycemia and stabilize his blood glucose levels. 

Answer: (E) Reducing daily insulin dose
