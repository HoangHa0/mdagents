Question: Two days after being admitted for pneumonia, a 70-year-old man has repeated episodes of palpitations and nausea. He does not feel lightheaded and does not have chest pain. The patient appears mildly distressed. His pulse is 59/min and blood pressure is 110/60 mm Hg. Examination shows no abnormalities. Sputum cultures taken at the time of admission were positive for Mycoplasma pneumoniae. His magnesium is 2.0 mEq/L and his potassium is 3.7 mEq/L. An ECG taken during an episode of palpitations is shown. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? (A) Administration of metoprolol (D) Intermittent transvenous overdrive pacing (B) Administration of magnesium sulfate (C) Administration of amiodarone (E) Adminstration of potassium chloride
Reason: In this scenario, the patient is experiencing palpitations and nausea, along with a pulse rate of 59/min, which could indicate a type of bradyarrhythmia. The low magnesium level of 2.0 mEq/L suggests a potential for arrhythmias, particularly in the context of a recent illness (pneumonia) and the stress it could cause on the body. Administering magnesium sulfate can help correct hypomagnesemia and possibly alleviate the patient's symptoms.
Answer: (B) Administration of magnesium sulfate

Question: A 39-year-old male is rushed to the emergency department after he developed a sudden-onset severe headache with ensuing nausea, vomiting, vision changes, and loss of consciousness. Past medical history is unattainable. He reports that the headache is worse than any he has experienced before. Noncontrast CT of the head is significant for an intracranial hemorrhage. Follow-up cerebral angiography is performed and shows a ruptured anterior communicating artery aneurysm. Which of the following has the strongest association with this patient's current presentation? (A) History of multiple hemangioblastomas of the retina and spine as well as pheochromocytoma (E) History of renal transplantation at 8 years of age (D) Kidney ultrasound showing numerous bilateral renal cysts (C) Abdominal CT suggestive of renal cell carcinoma (B) Brain MRI showing a butterfly glioma with a central necrotic core
Reason: The presentation of a 39-year-old male with a ruptured anterior communicating artery aneurysm strongly suggests an underlying connective tissue disorder. The strongest association with both intracranial aneurysms and renal cysts is seen in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), which is characterized by numerous bilateral renal cysts on imaging. Thus, the finding of bilateral renal cysts on ultrasound is closely linked to the patient's aneurysm and his overall health condition.
Answer: (D) Kidney ultrasound showing numerous bilateral renal cysts

Question: A 32-year-old G1P0 woman at 27 weeks estimated gestational age presents for her first prenatal care appointment. She recently immigrated to the United States and didn’t receive any prenatal care in her country. Her blood pressure is 130/70 mm Hg, pulse is 85/min, and respirations are 16/min. Her BMI is 38.3 kg/m2. Physical examination is unremarkable except for normal pregnancy changes. Fetal ultrasound is performed and reveals fetal macrosomia. Which one of the following diagnostic tests is most likely to reveal the cause of this fetal abnormality? (A) Serum insulin (B) C-peptide (C) Oral glucose tolerance test (D) Glycated hemoglobin (E) Leptin
Reason: In this scenario, the woman presents with fetal macrosomia, which is commonly associated with maternal hyperglycemia and gestational diabetes. The oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is a standard diagnostic tool used to assess for gestational diabetes, which could be the underlying cause of the fetal macrosomia observed in this patient. Thus, performing the OGTT is the most appropriate next step to investigate the potential cause of the fetal abnormality.
Answer: (C) Oral glucose tolerance test

Question: A 24-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of increased urination. She has also had dry mouth and excessive thirst despite drinking several gallons of water daily. She has a history of obsessive-compulsive disorder treated with citalopram. She drinks 1–2 cans of beer daily. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Serum studies show a Na+ concentration of 130 mEq/L, a glucose concentration of 185 mg/dL, and an osmolality of 265 mOsmol/kg. Urine osmolality is 230 mOsmol/kg. The patient is asked to stop drinking water for 3 hours. Following water restriction, repeated laboratory studies show a serum osmolality of 280 mOsmol/kg and a urine osmolality of 650 mOsmol/kg. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? (C) Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (B) Syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion (E) Beer potomania (A) Primary hyperparathyroidism (D) Primary polydipsia
Reason: The answer is (D) Primary polydipsia because the patient's symptoms of increased thirst and urination occur concurrently with a low serum sodium concentration, which is consistent with excessive water intake. Additionally, the significant increase in urine osmolality from 230 to 650 mOsmol/kg after water restriction indicates that her kidneys are functioning properly and can concentrate urine, which supports the diagnosis of primary polydipsia rather than a disorder affecting antidiuretic hormone (ADH) action.
Answer: (D) Primary polydipsia

Question: A 67-year-old woman comes to the emergency department 1 hour after her husband saw her faint shortly after getting out of bed from a nap. She regained consciousness within 30 seconds and was fully alert and oriented. She has had 2 similar episodes in the last 5 years, once while standing in line at the grocery store and once when getting out of bed in the morning. 24-hour Holter monitoring and echocardiography were unremarkable at her last hospitalization 1 year ago. She has hypertension, depression, and asthma. Current medications include verapamil, nortriptyline, and an albuterol inhaler as needed. Her temperature is 37°C (98.4°F), pulse is 74/min and regular, respirations are 14/min, blood pressure is 114/72 mm Hg when supine and 95/60 mm Hg while standing. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. Neurologic examination shows no focal findings. A complete blood count and serum concentrations of electrolytes, urea nitrogen, creatinine, and glucose are within the reference range. Bedside cardiac monitoring shows rare premature ventricular contractions and T-wave inversions in lead III. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms? (C) Structural cardiac abnormality (D) Hemorrhagic blood loss (E) Cardiac arrhythmia (A) Adrenal insufficiency (B) Autonomic dysfunction
Reason: The most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is (B) autonomic dysfunction due to her orthostatic hypotension, indicated by the significant drop in blood pressure when moving from a supine to standing position. This condition can frequently lead to syncope, particularly in older adults, as they may have a diminished ability to regulate blood pressure changes associated with position changes. The patient's history of similar fainting episodes and the absence of structural cardiac abnormalities further support autonomic dysfunction as the underlying cause.
Answer: (B) Autonomic dysfunction

Question: A 24-year-old man is running a marathon. Upon reaching the finish line, his serum lactate levels were measured and were significantly increased as compared to his baseline. Which of the following pathways converts the lactate produced by muscles into glucose and transports it back to the muscles? (A) Glycogenesis (C) Glycolysis (E) Pentose phosphate pathway (B) Citric acid cycle (D) Cori cycle
Reason: The correct answer is (D) the Cori cycle, which describes the process where lactate generated in muscles during anaerobic glycolysis is transported to the liver, converted back into glucose through gluconeogenesis, and then returned to the muscles for energy. This cycling of lactate between muscles and the liver is essential during high-intensity exercise when oxygen levels are insufficient for complete aerobic metabolism, leading to the accumulation of lactate.
Answer: (D) Cori cycle

Question: An 8-year-old boy presents to his pediatrician for a well visit. His parents state that he has been doing well in school and has many friends. The patient is a member of the chess club and enjoys playing video games. He has a past medical history of asthma which is treated with albuterol. The patient is in the 99th percentile for weight and 30th percentile for height. His temperature is 99.5°F (37.5°C), blood pressure is 122/88 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 11/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. The patient's body mass index is 39.1 kg/m^2 at this visit. On physical exam, you note a young boy who maintains eye contact and is excited to be at the doctor's office. Cardiopulmonary exam is within normal limits. Abdominal exam reveals normal bowel sounds and is non-tender in all 4 quadrants. Neurological and musculoskeletal exams are within normal limits. Which of the following is the most likely outcome in this patient? (E) Slipped capital femoral epiphysis (C) Hypertension (D) Precocious puberty (B) Constitutional growth delay (A) Atherosclerotic heart disease
Reason: The best answer to this question is (C) Hypertension. The child is in the 99th percentile for weight with a body mass index of 39.1 kg/m², which indicates obesity. This condition is commonly associated with elevated blood pressure and can lead to hypertension. Additionally, the blood pressure reading of 122/88 mmHg is concerning for hypertension in a child of this age, especially considering his high weight percentile. 

Reasoning: The boy's obesity likely predisposes him to hypertension; thus, the elevated blood pressure readings align with the complications associated with obesity. Precocious puberty is less likely given the context and findings in the vignette.

Question: A 34-year-old man comes to the physician because of foul-smelling diarrhea, fatigue, and bloating for 6 months. During this time, he has had a 5-kg (11-lb) weight loss without a change in diet. He has type 1 diabetes mellitus that is well-controlled with insulin. Examination shows conjunctival pallor and inflammation of the corners of the mouth. The abdomen is soft, and there is diffuse tenderness to palpation with no guarding or rebound. His hemoglobin concentration is 10.4 g/dL. The patient undergoes upper endoscopy. A photomicrograph of tissue from an intestinal biopsy is shown. Which of the following is most likely to improve this patient's symptoms? (A) Treatment with ceftriaxone (D) Reduced intake of milk proteins (B) Avoidance of certain types of cereal grains (C) Surgical resection of the colon (E) Supplemention of pancreatic enzymes
"
Reason: The most likely answer is (B) Avoidance of certain types of cereal grains, as the symptoms described—foul-smelling diarrhea, weight loss, fatigue, and the need for avoidance of certain foods—are suggestive of celiac disease. This condition is characterized by an immune reaction to gluten, a protein found in wheat and other grains. By eliminating gluten from the diet, patients typically experience significant improvement in symptoms.

Reasoning: The clinical presentation and symptoms align with celiac disease, which is managed through dietary modification. Avoidance of gluten-containing grains can lead to symptomatic relief and improvement in intestinal health, as confirmed by histological findings during the biopsy.
Answer: (B) Avoidance of certain types of cereal grains

Question: A 40-year-old man presents to the office with complaints of fatigue and difficulty breathing for the past few weeks. He also complains of early morning stiffness of his metatarsophalangeal and metacarpophalangeal joints on both sides that lasts for 2 hours. He feels better only after a warm water tub bath every day in the morning. He denies noticing any kind of rash on his body. He has been working in the shipbuilding industry for 20 years. He loves skin tanning and hunting in summer. He smokes 2 packs of cigarettes every day and has been doing so for the past 15 years. His pulmonary function test shows reduced forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio with a reduction of both FEV1 and FEV1 and decreased diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO). His chest X-ray shows multiple nodules with calcification. Which of the following antibodies will most likely be present in this patient that is very specific to the condition he has? (D) Anti-ds-DNA (B) Anti-Scl 70 (A) Anti-CCP (C) Anti-Ro (E) Anti-Jo1
Reason: The best answer is (A) Anti-CCP, which stands for anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies. The patient's symptoms—bilateral joint stiffness, fatigue, and difficulty breathing—along with his history of occupational exposure and smoking, indicate a likely diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Anti-CCP antibodies are highly specific for RA and can often be present even in early stages of the disease.

Reasoning: The clinical signs of morning stiffness and joint involvement are characteristic of rheumatoid arthritis, and the presence of anti-CCP antibodies is a key indicator for diagnosing this autoimmune condition, making it an appropriate answer in this scenario.
Answer: (A) Anti-CCP

Question: A 65-year-old non-smoking woman with no symptoms comes to your clinic to establish care with a primary care provider. She hasn’t seen a doctor in 12 years and states that she feels very healthy. You realize that guidelines by the national cancer organization suggest that she is due for some cancer screening tests, including a mammogram for breast cancer, a colonoscopy for colon cancer, and a pap smear for cervical cancer. These three screening tests are most likely to be considered which of the following? (C) Tertiary prevention (E) Cancer screening does not fit into these categories (B) Secondary prevention (D) Quaternary prevention (A) Primary prevention
Reason: The answer is (B) Secondary prevention because cancer screening tests like mammograms, colonoscopies, and Pap smears are designed to detect cancer at an early stage before symptoms appear. This type of prevention aims to catch diseases early when they are more treatable, which is the essence of secondary prevention.

Question: A 27-year-old male arrives to your walk-in clinic complaining of neck pain. He reports that the discomfort began two hours ago, and now he feels like he can’t move his neck. He also thinks he is having hot flashes, but he denies dyspnea or trouble swallowing. The patient’s temperature is 99°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 124/76 mmHg, pulse is 112/min, and respirations are 14/min with an oxygen saturation of 99% O2 on room air. You perform a physical exam of the patient's neck, and you note that his neck is rigid and flexed to the left. You are unable to passively flex or rotate the patient's neck to the right. There is no airway compromise. The patient's past medical history is significant for asthma, and he was also recently diagnosed with schizophrenia. The patient denies current auditory or visual hallucinations. He appears anxious, but his speech is organized and appropriate. Which of the following is the best initial step in management? (E) Propranolol (A) Change medication to clozapine (D) Lorazepam (B) Dantrolene (C) Diphenhydramine
Reason: The answer is (C) Diphenhydramine because the patient's symptoms, including neck rigidity, have the clinical appearance of acute dystonia, which can occur with antipsychotic medications like the ones used to treat schizophrenia. Diphenhydramine, an antihistamine with anticholinergic properties, is commonly used as a first-line treatment to relieve acute dystonic reactions.

Question: A previously healthy 20-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 15 minutes after collapsing while playing basketball. He has no history of serious illness. On arrival, there is no palpable pulse or respiratory effort observed. He is declared dead. The family agrees to an autopsy. Cardiac workup prior to this patient's death would most likely have shown which of the following findings? (D) Ventricular septum defect (C) Bicuspid aortic valve (A) Systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve (E) Symmetric thickening of the left ventricle (B) Narrowing of the left main coronary artery
Reason: The answer is (A) Systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve because this finding is often associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), a common cause of sudden cardiac death in young athletes. In HCM, the ventricular wall thickening can lead to dynamic obstruction of blood flow, and as such, an autopsy would likely reveal this characteristic feature, which is typically not detected until after the patient suffers a collapse or cardiac event.
Answer: (A) Systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve

Question: A 37-year-old woman comes to the physician because of right-sided inguinal pain for the past 8 weeks. During this period, the patient has had increased pain during activities such as walking and standing. She has no nausea, vomiting, or fever. Her temperature is 36.8°C (98.2°F), pulse is 73/min, and blood pressure is 132/80 mm Hg. The abdomen is soft and nontender. There is a visible and palpable groin protrusion above the inguinal ligament on the right side. Bulging is felt during Valsalva maneuver. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? (E) Strangulated hernia (A) Lipoma (D) Direct inguinal hernia (C) Inguinal lymphadenopathy (B) Indirect inguinal hernia
Reason: An indirect inguinal hernia occurs when abdominal contents protrude through the inguinal canal, and in this case, the presence of a visible and palpable groin protrusion that increases with the Valsalva maneuver is consistent with this type of hernia. Additionally, the right-sided location of the bulge and the absence of any signs of nausea or fever further support the diagnosis of an indirect inguinal hernia rather than other potential conditions.

Question: A 42-year-old man comes to the physician for the evaluation of episodic headaches involving both temples for 5 months. The patient has been taking acetaminophen, but it has not provided relief. He has also had double vision. Ophthalmic examination shows impaired peripheral vision bilaterally. Contrast MRI of the head shows a 14 x 10 x 8-mm intrasellar mass. Further evaluation is most likely to show which of the following findings? (E) Diarrhea (D) Polyuria (C) Galactorrhea (B) Impotence (A) Macroglossia
Reason: The presence of an intrasellar mass, likely a pituitary adenoma, can lead to hormonal imbalances, particularly affecting the secretion of gonadotropins, which may result in impotence in men. In this patient’s case, the combination of headaches, visual disturbances, and the locational characteristics of the mass strongly indicates a pituitary tumor, and related symptoms such as impotence are consistent with its impact on hormonal regulation.

Question: A 9-month-old baby boy is brought to his pediatrician due to poor feeding and fewer bowel movements. His father notes that he has been less active and is having difficulty with movements such as rolling over. Vital signs are normal, and physical exam is notable for weak sucking reflex, ptosis, and decreased eye movements. In addition, the baby has generalized weakness and flushed skin. Stool samples are collected, treatment is started immediately, and the baby’s condition improves. The results of the stool studies return several days later and show gram-positive, anaerobic rods. The toxin most likely responsible for this baby’s condition acts through which mechanism? (A) Inhibition of neurotransmitter release (E) Impairment of phagocytosis (D) Increased chloride secretion within the gut (B) Inhibition of protein synthesis (C) Degradation of the cell membrane
Reason: The scenario describes a 9-month-old baby with symptoms suggestive of botulism, which is often caused by the toxin produced by Clostridium botulinum. This toxin inhibits the release of neurotransmitters at the neuromuscular junction, leading to weakness and paralysis, hence the selection of option (A) is supported by the mechanism of action of botulinum toxin.
Answer: (A) Inhibition of neurotransmitter release

Her temperature is 37.3°C (99.1°F), pulse is 100/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Arterial blood gas analysis on room air shows:
pH 7.58
PCO2 43 mm Hg
PO2 96 mm Hg
HCO3- 32 mEq/L
The most appropriate next step in diagnosis is measurement of which of the following?" (B) Serum osmolal gap (A) Urine albumin to creatinine ratio (D) Urine anion gap (C) Urine chloride (E) Serum anion gap
Reason: The arterial blood gas analysis shows a metabolic alkalosis (pH 7.58 and HCO3- 32 mEq/L) with a normal PCO2, which can result from various conditions, including hypovolemia or potassium depletion. Measurement of urine chloride is helpful in determining the cause of the metabolic alkalosis; if urine chloride is low, it suggests a contraction alkalosis due to volume depletion, while a high urine chloride indicates possible primary hyperaldosteronism or other reasons for metabolic alkalosis.

Question: A 46-year-old woman presents to the emergency department complaining of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting approximately 4 hours after a fatty meal. She reports that this has happened before, but this episode is worse. The vomit was non-bilious and did not contain any blood. She recalls frequent episodes of vague epigastric pain that often wakes her up during the night. Over the counter omeprazole and a small meal or snack would provide some relief in the past. The patient also mentions recent anorexia and early satiety. She takes over the counter ibuprofen several times a week for headaches. Blood pressure is 125/82 mm Hg, pulse is 102/min, and respiratory rate is 19/min. On physical examination, she has hypoactive bowel sounds, and her abdomen seems grossly distended and tympanic on percussion. Which of the following is most consistent with a duodenal ulcer? (A) Non-bilious vomiting (C) Ibuprofen use (E) Food ingestion provides relief of the symptoms (B) Early satiety (D) Omeprazole provides relief of the symptoms
Reason: The answer is (E) Food ingestion provides relief of the symptoms because duodenal ulcers are typically associated with pain that is relieved by eating, as food helps buffer gastric acid and may temporarily reduce irritation to the ulcer. This is in contrast to gastric ulcers, where eating often exacerbates the pain, making the symptom relief after eating a key distinguishing feature consistent with a duodenal ulcer.
Answer: (E) Food ingestion provides relief of the symptoms

Question: A 6-month-old male presents for a routine visit to his pediatrician. Two months ago, the patient was seen for tachypnea and wheezing, and diagnosed with severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis. After admission to the hospital and supportive care, the patient recovered and currently is not experiencing any trouble breathing. Regarding the possible of future reactive airway disease, which of the following statements is most accurate? (E) “Your child’s risk of asthma is less than the general population.” (A) “Your child’s risk of asthma is the same as the general population.” (C) “Your child has a less than 5% chance of developing asthma” (B) “There is no clear relationship between RSV and the development of asthma.” (D) “Your child has a greater than 20% chance of developing asthma”
Reason: The conclusion is based on research indicating that infants with severe RSV bronchiolitis have an increased risk of developing asthma later in childhood. Studies suggest that approximately 20-30% of children who experience severe RSV infections may go on to develop asthma, which supports the statement that this child's risk is greater than 20%.
Answer: (D) “Your child has a greater than 20% chance of developing asthma”

Question: A 54-year-old man comes to the physician for the evaluation of difficulty swallowing of both solids and liquids for 1 month. During the past 5 months, he has also had increased weakness of his hands and legs. He sails regularly and is unable to hold the ropes as tightly as before. Ten years ago, he was involved in a motor vehicle collision. Examination shows atrophy of the tongue. Muscle strength is decreased in the right upper and lower extremities. There is muscle stiffness in the left lower extremity. Deep tendon reflexes are 1+ in the right upper and lower extremities, 3+ in the left upper extremity, and 4+ in the left lower extremity. Plantar reflex shows an extensor response on the left foot. Sensation to light touch, pinprick, and vibration is intact. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? (E) Cervical spondylosis with myelopathy
" (D) Subacute combined degeneration of spinal cord (A) Syringomyelia (C) Inclusion-body myositis (B) Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
Reason: The symptoms presented, including dysphagia, muscular weakness, atrophy of the tongue, and a mix of upper and lower motor neuron signs (e.g., hyperreflexia on one side and atrophy on the other), are characteristic of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). ALS is a neurodegenerative disease affecting motor neurons, leading to both upper and lower motor neuron signs, which aligns with the clinical findings described in this case.
Answer: (B) Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis

Question: A 44-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department because of confusion and agitation. She was brought by police after she was found walking along a highway. The patient's brother comes to join her soon after her arrival. He says she has peptic ulcer disease and hypertension. He thinks she drinks around half a bottle of vodka daily. Her current medications include omeprazole and hydrochlorothiazide, although the brother is unsure if she takes them regularly. Her temperature is 37.1°C (98.7°F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 135/90 mm Hg. On mental status examination, she is confused and not oriented to person, place, or time. Neurologic examination shows horizontal nystagmus. Her gait is wide-based with small steps. Her hemoglobin concentration is 9 g/dL. Her serum homocysteine concentration is elevated and her methylmalonic acid concentration is within the reference range. A peripheral blood smear shows hypersegmented neutrophils. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's anemia? (C) Alcohol abuse (E) Vitamin B12 deficency (D) Vitamin B1 deficiency (A) Folate deficiency (B) Vitamin E deficiency
Reason: This patient's presentation suggests folate deficiency as the most likely cause of her anemia. The combination of confusion, agitation, a history of alcohol use, and the presence of hypersegmented neutrophils on the peripheral blood smear are indicative of macrocytic anemia, commonly associated with folate deficiency, particularly in individuals with chronic alcohol consumption, which can impair folate absorption and metabolism.
Answer: (A) Folate deficiency

Question: A 6-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of a 2-week history of fever and pain in his right thigh that is causing him to limp. The mother thinks he may have hurt himself during soccer practice. He has no history of rash or joint pain. His older sister has systemic lupus erythematosus. His immunizations are up-to-date. The patient is at the 40th percentile for height and 45th percentile for weight. His temperature is 39°C (102.2°F), pulse is 100/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg. Examination shows swelling, tenderness, warmth, and mild erythema over the right upper thigh; range of motion is limited by pain. He has a right-sided antalgic gait. His leukocyte count is 12,300/mm3 and erythrocyte sedimentation rate is 40 mm/h. X-rays of the hips and lower extremities are unremarkable. An MRI of the right lower extremity shows increased T2 and decreased T1 signals over the right femur with periosteal elevation, multiple osteolytic areas in the femoral metaphysis, and bone marrow edema. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? (B) Nuclear scan of the right upper leg (D) Arthrocentesis (E) Bone biopsy of the right femur (A) Nafcillin therapy (C) Femoral osteotomy
Reason: A bone biopsy of the right femur is the most appropriate next step in management given the presentation of fever, localized pain, and MRI findings suggestive of possible osteomyelitis or a primary bone lesion. Since the imaging and clinical symptoms raise suspicion for a significant underlying pathology, a biopsy is necessary to obtain a definitive diagnosis and guide further treatment.
Answer: (E) Bone biopsy of the right femur

Question: A 34-year-old woman visits the physician with complaints of difficulty swallowing and recurrent vomiting for the past 6 months. She even noticed food particles in her vomit a few hours after eating her meals. She has lost about 3.0 kg (6.6 lb) over the past 4 months. Her history is significant for a trip to Argentina last year. Her past medical history is insignificant. She is a non-smoker. On examination, her blood pressure is 118/75 mm Hg, respirations are 17/min, pulse is 78/min, temperature is 36.7°C (98.1°F), and her BMI is 24 kg/m². There is no abdominal tenderness, distension, or evidence of jaundice. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient? (A) Biopsy (D) Antibiotic therapy (B) Surgery (E) Routine blood tests (C) Barium XR
Reason: A Barium XR is the most appropriate next step in management for this patient with difficulty swallowing and recurrent vomiting, as it can help evaluate for structural abnormalities in the esophagus or gastrointestinal tract. Given her recent travel history and symptoms, this imaging study can aid in diagnosing conditions such as a stricture, obstruction, or other pathologies that may be contributing to her swallowing difficulties.
Answer: (C) Barium XR
[INFO] Sampling path 10 completed.
[INFO] Opinion paths:
Path 1: Let's analyze the clinical scenario step by step. 

1. **Patient History and Symptoms**: 
   - The patient is a 21-year-old male who recently returned from a trip to Vietnam and Cambodia, presenting with fatigue, headache, malaise, pain in his hands and wrists, and a fever of 102.5°F.
   - He has a maculopapular rash on his trunk and upper thighs, and tenderness over his bilateral metacarpophalangeal joints.

2. **Laboratory Findings**:
   - Leukopenia (low white blood cell count of 3,200/mm³) and thrombocytopenia (low platelet count of 112,000/mm³) are present.
   - Elevated liver enzymes (AST 106 U/L and ALT 112 U/L) but normal bilirubin levels.

3. **Travel History**: 
   - The recent travel to Southeast Asia raises the suspicion for infections endemic to that region.

4. **Differential Diagnosis**:
   - **Dengue Fever**: Characterized by fever, headache, retro-orbital pain, myalgia, arthralgia, rash, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. It is also common in Southeast Asia.
   - **Chikungunya**: Also presents with fever and severe joint pain, often with a rash, and is endemic in the same regions. 
   - **Hepatitis A**: Typically presents with jaundice, fatigue, and elevated liver enzymes, but less likely to cause the severe joint pain.
   - **Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)**: Commonly causes infectious mononucleosis, which would not typically present with the joint pain and travel history like this.
   - **Typhoid Fever**: Would typically present with prolonged fever and abdominal symptoms, not primarily joint pain.

5. **Conclusion**: 
   - Given the combination of fever, rash, joint pain, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver enzymes, and considering the travel history to Southeast Asia, the most likely diagnosis in this case is **Dengue fever**.

Answer: (B) Dengue fever
Path 2: Let's analyze the case step by step:

1. **Symptoms and History**: The patient has recently returned from a trip to Southeast Asia (Vietnam and Cambodia) and presents with fatigue, worsening headache, malaise, joint pain (especially in the hands and wrists), and a maculopapular rash. 

2. **Vital Signs**: The patient has a fever of 102.5°F (39.2°C) and tachycardia (pulse of 105/min).

3. **Laboratory Findings**: 
   - Leukopenia (leukocyte count of 3200/mm³)
   - Thrombocytopenia (platelet count of 112,000/mm³)
   - Elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT elevated)

4. **Physical Examination**: The presence of bilateral metacarpophalangeal joint tenderness and a negative tourniquet test suggests that the patient is experiencing a viral illness rather than a primary bleeding disorder.

5. **Differential Diagnosis**:
   - **Hepatitis A** is less likely as it typically does not present with significant joint pain or a rash.
   - **Chikungunya** is characterized by high fever, severe joint pain, and rash, which aligns well with the patient's symptoms.
   - **Epstein-Barr virus** typically causes infectious mononucleosis, which includes fatigue, fever, and often lymphadenopathy, but not necessarily the joint pain seen here.
   - **Dengue fever** can present with fever, rash, and bleeding tendencies (including thrombocytopenia), but it usually has more severe symptoms including retro-orbital pain and can also affect liver enzymes. 
   - **Typhoid fever** primarily presents with prolonged fever, abdominal symptoms, and is less likely to cause joint pain and rash.

Given the symptoms of fever, rash, joint pain, recent travel to areas where chikungunya is endemic, and the laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis in this patient is:

**Answer: (A) Chikungunya**
Path 3: Let's analyze the information step by step to arrive at the most likely diagnosis.

1. **Patient Presentation**:
   - 21-year-old male with fatigue, worsening headache, malaise, and joint pain (especially in hands and wrists).
   - Recently returned from a 2-week vacation to Vietnam and Cambodia, which are areas where certain viral infections are endemic.

2. **Physical Examination Findings**:
   - Fever (102.5°F or 39.2°C).
   - Tenderness over the bilateral metacarpophalangeal joints (suggestive of arthralgia).
   - Maculopapular rash on trunk and upper thighs.

3. **Laboratory Results**:
   - Leukopenia (WBC count of 3,200/mm^3).
   - Thrombocytopenia (platelet count of 112,000/mm^3).
   - Elevated liver enzymes (AST: 106 U/L, ALT: 112 U/L).
   - Normal bilirubin levels.

4. **Symptoms and Lab Results Correlation**:
   - The combination of fever, arthralgia, rash, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia is highly suggestive of a viral infection commonly associated with these findings.
   - Dengue fever, which is endemic in Southeast Asia, is characterized by high fever, severe headache, retro-orbital pain, joint and muscle pain, and can lead to thrombocytopenia and leukopenia.

5. **Differential Diagnosis**:
   - **Hepatitis A**: Typically presents with jaundice and elevated bilirubin, which is not seen here.
   - **Chikungunya**: Also causes fever and joint pain, but it typically does not cause significant leukopenia or thrombocytopenia to this extent.
   - **Epstein-Barr virus**: More commonly associated with lymphadenopathy and atypical lymphocytes rather than this presentation.
   - **Typhoid fever**: Would present with abdominal symptoms and not typically with the joint pain and rash described.

Given the travel history, clinical presentation, and laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is:

**Answer: (B) Dengue fever**
Path 4: Let's analyze the case step by step to reach the most likely diagnosis.

1. **Patient's Travel History**: The patient recently returned from Vietnam and Cambodia, regions where dengue fever and chikungunya are endemic.

2. **Symptoms**: 
   - He presents with fatigue, worsening headache, malaise, and pain in the hands and wrists. 
   - He also has a fever (102.5°F), a maculopapular rash, and tenderness in the metacarpophalangeal joints. 

3. **Laboratory Findings**:
   - Leukopenia (low white blood cell count of 3,200/mm³).
   - Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count of 112,000/mm³).
   - Elevated liver enzymes (AST: 106 U/L, ALT: 112 U/L).

4. **Negative Tourniquet Test**: This finding is used to assess for increased vascular permeability associated with dengue fever. A negative test makes dengue less likely but does not rule it out entirely.

5. **Comparison of Possible Diagnoses**:
   - **Hepatitis A** typically presents with gastrointestinal symptoms, and the history does not suggest an exposure risk for hepatitis A.
   - **Chikungunya** is characterized by polyarthralgia (joint pain) and fever, often with rash. The travel history fits, and the joint pain is significant.
   - **Epstein-Barr virus** typically presents with more classic symptoms of infectious mononucleosis (sore throat, lymphadenopathy) and is less likely given the travel history and symptomatology.
   - **Dengue fever** often causes fever, rash, and joint pain, with a significant drop in platelet count and leukopenia.
   - **Typhoid fever** usually presents with prolonged fever and abdominal symptoms, which are not emphasized in this case.

6. **Conclusion**: While chikungunya fits the joint pain and recent travel history, the significant thrombocytopenia and the overall clinical picture suggest that dengue fever is more likely. 

Therefore, after considering all factors, the most likely diagnosis is **(B) Dengue fever**.
Path 5: Let's analyze the case step by step.

The patient is a 21-year-old male who recently returned from a trip to Vietnam and Cambodia, presenting with fatigue, fever, headache, malaise, and joint pain, particularly in the hands and wrists. He also has a maculopapular rash and laboratory findings showing leukopenia (low white blood cell count) and thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), along with elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT).

Given the travel history to Southeast Asia, the symptoms, and the lab findings, we can consider the possible diagnoses:

- **Hepatitis A (D)**: Typically presents with jaundice, abdominal pain, and elevated liver enzymes but does not usually cause significant joint pain or rash.

- **Chikungunya (A)**: Characterized by fever and severe joint pain, especially in the hands and wrists, which aligns with this patient's symptoms. However, the lab findings do not specifically indicate this.

- **Epstein-Barr virus (C)**: Commonly associated with infectious mononucleosis, which usually presents with pharyngitis, lymphadenopathy, and elevated liver enzymes, but does not typically cause such acute joint pain.

- **Dengue fever (B)**: Commonly presents with fever, headache, retro-orbital pain, myalgias, arthralgias, rash, and bleeding tendencies. The thrombocytopenia and leukopenia are consistent with dengue fever.

- **Typhoid fever (E)**: Would typically present with sustained fever, abdominal pain, and possibly rash (rose spots), but not commonly with severe joint pain.

Considering the symptoms and lab findings, **Dengue fever (B)** is the most likely diagnosis, particularly due to the combination of fever, rash, arthralgia, and thrombocytopenia.

Thus, the answer is: **(B) Dengue fever**.
Path 6: To determine the most likely diagnosis for this patient, let's analyze the key points from the case step by step:

1. **Travel History**: The patient recently returned from Vietnam and Cambodia, regions where several viral infections are prevalent.

2. **Symptoms**: The patient presents with fatigue, worsening headache, malaise, joint pain (especially in the hands and wrists), fever (102.5°F), and a maculopapular rash. These symptoms are indicative of a viral infection.

3. **Laboratory Findings**: 
   - Leukopenia (low white blood cell count: 3200/mm^3).
   - Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count: 112,000/mm^3).
   - Elevated liver enzymes (AST: 106 U/L, ALT: 112 U/L).

4. **Negative Tourniquet Test**: This indicates that there is no significant bleeding tendency, which is often assessed in the context of dengue fever.

Now, let's consider the options provided:

- **(D) Hepatitis A**: It could cause elevated liver enzymes and fatigue but does not typically cause joint pain or a rash like this.
  
- **(A) Chikungunya**: Characterized by high fever, severe joint pain, and a rash. Joint pain can be significant and prolonged.

- **(C) Epstein-Barr virus**: Typically associated with infectious mononucleosis (fever, lymphadenopathy, fatigue) but less likely to present with severe joint pain and thrombocytopenia.

- **(B) Dengue fever**: Common in tropical regions, presents with fever, severe headache, retro-orbital pain, muscle and joint pain, and can cause thrombocytopenia and elevated liver enzymes. However, the negative tourniquet test makes this less likely.

- **(E) Typhoid fever**: Can cause fever and abdominal symptoms, but the rash and joint pain are not typical.

Given the travel history, fever, joint pain, rash, and laboratory findings, **(A) Chikungunya** is the most likely diagnosis. Chikungunya is known for causing high fever, joint pain (especially in the hands and wrists), and is prevalent in the regions visited by the patient.

**Answer: (A) Chikungunya**
Path 7: To analyze the clinical scenario step by step:

1. **Travel History**: The patient recently returned from a trip to Vietnam and Cambodia, regions where several viral infections are prevalent, including dengue fever and chikungunya.

2. **Symptoms**: The patient presents with fatigue, worsening headache, malaise, and pain in the hands and wrists. He also has a maculopapular rash and tenderness in the metacarpophalangeal joints.

3. **Vital Signs and Labs**: The patient has a fever (102.5°F), leukopenia (low white blood cell count of 3,200/mm³), and thrombocytopenia (low platelet count of 112,000/mm³). His liver enzymes (AST and ALT) are elevated, which is indicative of liver involvement.

4. **Negative Tourniquet Test**: This test is used in the evaluation of dengue fever; a negative result can suggest that the patient's condition is not due to dengue.

5. **Possible Diagnoses**:
   - **Hepatitis A**: Typically presents with jaundice and gastrointestinal symptoms; less likely given the joint pain and travel history.
   - **Chikungunya**: Characterized by high fever and severe joint pain, particularly in the hands and wrists, with a potential rash. Fits the clinical picture well.
   - **Epstein-Barr Virus**: Typically associated with mononucleosis symptoms, including severe fatigue and lymphadenopathy, not primarily joint pain or rash.
   - **Dengue Fever**: Characterized by high fever, headache, retro-orbital pain, and joint/muscle pain, but the negative tourniquet test and specific joint pain make this less likely.
   - **Typhoid Fever**: Associated with abdominal symptoms, prolonged fever, and often gastrointestinal bleeding; less likely given the joint involvement and rash.

Based on the combination of joint pain, maculopapular rash, fever, and recent travel history to an endemic region, the most likely diagnosis is:

**Answer: (A) Chikungunya**
Path 8: Let's analyze the information provided step by step.

1. **Symptoms**: The patient presented with fatigue, headache, malaise, and joint pain in the hands and wrists. He also has a fever (102.5°F), tenderness over the metacarpophalangeal joints, and a maculopapular rash.

2. **Travel History**: The patient recently returned from a 2-week vacation in Vietnam and Cambodia, which are regions where certain viral infections are more prevalent.

3. **Laboratory Findings**: 
   - Leukopenia (leukocyte count of 3,200/mm^3)
   - Thrombocytopenia (platelet count of 112,000/mm^3)
   - Elevated liver enzymes (AST: 106 U/L, ALT: 112 U/L)

4. **Negative Tourniquet Test**: This suggests that there is no significant bleeding tendency due to thrombocytopenia, which is more consistent with viral infections.

5. **Differential Diagnosis**:
   - **Dengue Fever (B)**: Associated with travel to endemic areas, presents with fever, joint pain, rash, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. The symptoms and lab findings fit well.
   - **Chikungunya (A)**: Also presents with fever and severe joint pain, but it usually does not cause significant leukopenia or liver enzyme elevation compared to dengue.
   - **Hepatitis A (D)**: Typically presents with jaundice and significant transaminitis but does not usually present with joint pain and is less associated with leukopenia.
   - **Epstein-Barr Virus (C)**: Commonly causes infectious mononucleosis, which includes fatigue, fever, and lymphadenopathy but doesn't typically present with thrombocytopenia or joint pain as a primary feature.
   - **Typhoid Fever (E)**: Usually presents with prolonged fever, abdominal symptoms, and a relative bradycardia, but the joint pain and rash are less characteristic.

Given the travel history, symptoms, and laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is:

**Answer: (B) Dengue fever**.
Path 9: Let's analyze the clinical presentation step by step.

1. **Recent Travel**: The patient has recently returned from a 2-week vacation to Vietnam and Cambodia, which indicates potential exposure to tropical infections.

2. **Symptoms**: The patient reports fatigue, worsening headache, malaise, and pain in his hands and wrists. These symptoms suggest a systemic viral infection.

3. **Physical Exam Findings**: The presence of a maculopapular rash on the trunk and upper thighs, along with tenderness over the metacarpophalangeal joints, can be indicative of a viral illness. The negative tourniquet test suggests that the patient does not have significant capillary fragility, which is seen in certain viral infections (e.g., dengue).

4. **Laboratory Results**: 
   - Leukopenia (leukocyte count of 3,200/mm^3) and thrombocytopenia (platelet count of 112,000/mm^3) are notable findings.
   - Elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT) indicate liver involvement, which is common in viral infections.
   - The hemoglobin and hematocrit are normal, but the lower white blood cell and platelet counts suggest a viral etiology.

5. **Differential Diagnosis**:
   - **Dengue Fever**: Known for causing fever, headache, retro-orbital pain, myalgias, rash, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia, particularly after travel to endemic areas. It can also cause elevated liver enzymes.
   - **Chikungunya**: Presents with fever and severe joint pain, but typically has a more prominent arthralgia component and might not present with significant thrombocytopenia or leukopenia in all cases.
   - **Hepatitis A**: Typically presents with jaundice and gastrointestinal symptoms, and while it can cause elevated liver enzymes, it does not commonly cause joint pain or significant thrombocytopenia.
   - **Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)**: Usually presents with fatigue, fever, and lymphadenopathy, but the travel history and joint pain are less typical for EBV.
   - **Typhoid Fever**: Would more likely present with sustained fever and gastrointestinal symptoms, and less with joint pain and maculopapular rash.

Considering the travel history to Southeast Asia, the clinical symptoms, and laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is:

**Answer: (B) Dengue fever**
Path 10: Let's analyze the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings step by step to arrive at the most likely diagnosis.

1. **Recent Travel History**: The patient has just returned from a trip to Vietnam and Cambodia, which is relevant as certain infectious diseases are endemic in these regions.

2. **Symptoms**: The patient presents with:
   - Fatigue
   - Worsening headache
   - Malaise
   - Pain in hands and wrists (arthralgia)
   - Fever (102.5°F)
   - Maculopapular rash

3. **Laboratory Findings**:
   - Leukopenia (leukocyte count: 3,200/mm³)
   - Thrombocytopenia (platelet count: 112,000/mm³)
   - Elevated liver enzymes (AST: 106 U/L, ALT: 112 U/L)

4. **Negative Tourniquet Test**: This indicates that there are no signs of increased capillary fragility or bleeding tendencies, which is often assessed in cases of dengue fever.

5. **Differential Diagnosis**:
   - **Hepatitis A**: Would typically present with jaundice and would not usually cause arthralgia or a rash.
   - **Chikungunya**: Commonly causes fever, rash, and significant arthralgia, especially affecting the hands and wrists, and is common in travelers returning from tropical areas.
   - **Epstein-Barr Virus**: Typically presents with fatigue, fever, and lymphadenopathy, not with significant arthralgia or thrombocytopenia.
   - **Dengue Fever**: Characterized by fever, rash, and arthralgia, often with leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. However, the negative tourniquet test makes it less likely.
   - **Typhoid Fever**: Usually presents with prolonged fever and gastrointestinal symptoms, which are not noted in this case.

Considering all of the above, the combination of fever, maculopapular rash, arthralgia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia, especially following travel to an endemic area, strongly supports a diagnosis of **Chikungunya fever**.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this patient is:
**Answer: (A) Chikungunya**.

Question: A 28-year-old primigravid woman comes to the emergency department because of a 12-hour history of lower abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding. She also had nausea and fatigue for the past 3 weeks. Her last menstrual period was 8 weeks ago. Prior to that, her menses occurred regularly at 30-day intervals and lasted for 4 days. There is no history of medical illness, and she takes no medications. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 95/min, and blood pressure is 100/70 mm Hg. Pelvic examination is painful and shows a uterus consistent in size with a 13-week gestation. A urine pregnancy test is positive. β-HCG level is 106,000 mIU/mL (N < 5 mIU/mL). Transvaginal ultrasonography shows unclear, amorphous fetal parts and a large placenta with multiple cystic spaces. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's condition? (B) Malignant transformation of trophoblastic tissue (E) Embryonic death with cervical dilation (D) Malpositioned placenta overlying the cervix (C) Trophoblastic proliferation with chorionic villi distention (A) Placenta implantation into myometrium
Reason: The patient's presentation is indicative of a molar pregnancy, which is characterized by trophoblastic proliferation and the abnormal growth of chorionic villi. The elevated β-HCG levels, along with the transvaginal ultrasound findings of a large placenta with multiple cystic spaces, support the diagnosis of a hydatidiform mole, thereby pointing to option (C) as the most likely cause of her condition.
Answer: (C) Trophoblastic proliferation with chorionic villi distention

Question: A 9-month-old boy is brought to a pediatrician by his parents for routine immunization. The parents say they have recently immigrated to the United States from a developing country, where the infant was receiving immunizations as per the national immunization schedule for that country. The pediatrician prepares a plan for the infant’s immunizations as per standard US guidelines. Looking at the plan, the parents ask why the infant needs to be vaccinated with injectable polio vaccine, as he had already received an oral polio vaccine back in their home country. The pediatrician explains to them that, as per the recommended immunization schedule for children and adolescents in the United States, it is important to complete the schedule of immunizations using the injectable polio vaccine (IPV). He also mentions that IPV is considered safer than OPV, and IPV has some distinct advantages over OPV. Which of the following statements best explains the advantage of IPV over OPV to which the pediatrician is referring? (B) IPV is known to produce higher titers of serum IgG antibodies than OPV (A) IPV is known to produce higher titers of mucosal IgA antibodies than OPV (D) IPV is known to produce virus-specific CD4+ T cells that produce interleukins and interferons to control polio viruses (E) IPV is known to produce higher titers of mucosal IgG antibodies than OPV (C) IPV is known to produce virus-specific CD8+ T cells that directly kills polio-infected cells
Reason: The injectable polio vaccine (IPV) is known to induce a stronger systemic immune response, leading to higher levels of serum IgG antibodies compared to the oral polio vaccine (OPV). This results in more effective long-term protection against poliovirus, particularly in controlling infections in the bloodstream and providing immunity against poliovirus-related paralysis.
Answer: (B) IPV is known to produce higher titers of serum IgG antibodies than OPV

Question: An otherwise healthy 56-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 3-year history of intermittent upper abdominal pain. She has had no nausea, vomiting, or change in weight. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies are within normal limits. Abdominal ultrasonography shows a hyperechogenic rim-like calcification of the gallbladder wall. The finding in this patient's ultrasonography increases the risk of which of the following conditions? (A) Hepatocellular carcinoma (C) Pyogenic liver abscess (E) Acute pancreatitis (D) Gallbladder carcinoma (B) Gallbladder empyema
Reason: The presence of a hyperechogenic rim-like calcification of the gallbladder wall, also known as "porcelain gallbladder," is an important sonographic finding that significantly increases the risk of gallbladder carcinoma. This condition is considered a pre-malignant state due to the chronic irritation and inflammation associated with the calcification, thereby predisposing the patient to gallbladder cancer.

Question: A 7-year-old boy is rushed to the urgent care department from a friend’s birthday party with breathing trouble. He is immediately placed on supplemental oxygen therapy. The patient’s father explains that peanut butter treats were served at the event, but he reported not having witnessed his son actually eat one. During the party, the patient approached his father with facial flushing, difficulty breathing, and itching of his face and neck. The patient was born at 40 weeks gestation via spontaneous vaginal delivery. He has met all age-related developmental milestones and is fully vaccinated. His past medical history is significant for peanut allergy and asthma. He carries an emergency inhaler. Family history is noncontributory. The patient’s vitals signs include a blood pressure of 110/85 mm Hg, a heart rate of 110/min, a respiratory rate of 25/min, and a temperature of 37.2°C (99.0°F). Physical examination reveals severe facial edema and severe audible stridor in both lungs. Which of the following types of hypersensitivity reaction is the most likely in this patient? (D) Type 4–cell-mediated (delayed) hypersensitivity reaction (A) Type 1–anaphylactic hypersensitivity reaction (E) Mixed anaphylactic and cytotoxic hypersensitivity reaction (C) Type 3–immune complex-mediated hypersensitivity reaction (B) Type 2–cytotoxic hypersensitivity reaction
Reason: The clinical presentation of the 7-year-old boy, including facial flushing, itching, difficulty breathing, and severe stridor, suggests an acute allergic reaction, which is characteristic of a Type 1 hypersensitivity reaction. This reaction is mediated by IgE antibodies and typically occurs rapidly after exposure to an allergen, such as peanuts, leading to anaphylaxis, which is consistent with the symptoms and history provided in this case.

Question: A 61-year-old male is given acetazolamide to treat open-angle glaucoma. Upon diuresis, his urine is found to be highly alkaline. Which of the following accounts for the alkaline nature of this patient’s urine? (E) Inhibition of bicarbonate reabsorption in beta-intercalated cells (B) Inhibition of chlorine reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule (A) Inhibition of chlorine reabsorption in the thick ascending loop of Henle (C) Inhibition of acid secretion in alpha-intercalated cells (D) Inhibition of bicarbonate reabsorption in the proximal tubule
Reason: The correct answer is (D) Inhibition of bicarbonate reabsorption in the proximal tubule. 

Acetazolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that decreases the reabsorption of bicarbonate in the proximal tubule, leading to increased bicarbonate in the urine. This elevated bicarbonate concentration results in an alkaline urine pH, as bicarbonate is a base and its enhanced presence contributes to higher alkalinity.
Answer: (D) Inhibition of bicarbonate reabsorption in the proximal tubule

Question: A group of bariatric surgeons are investigating a novel surgically-placed tube that drains a portion of the stomach following each meal. They are interested in studying its efficacy in facilitating weight loss in obese adults with BMIs > 40 kg/m2 who have failed to lose weight through non-surgical options. After randomizing 150 patients to undergoing the surgical tube procedure and 150 patients to non-surgical weight loss options (e.g., diet, exercise), the surgeons found that, on average, participants in the surgical treatment group lost 15% of their total body weight in comparison to 4% in the non-surgical group. Which of the following statistical tests is an appropriate initial test to evaluate if this difference in weight loss between the two groups is statistically significant? (E) Unpaired two-sample t-test (D) Pearson correlation coefficient (C) Multiple linear regression (B) Kaplan-Meier analysis (A) Paired two-sample t-test
Reason: The correct answer is (E) Unpaired two-sample t-test. 

This statistical test is appropriate because it compares the means of two independent groups—in this case, the surgical treatment group and the non-surgical treatment group. Since the researchers are interested in determining if there is a significant difference in average weight loss between these two distinct populations, the unpaired two-sample t-test is the correct choice.

Question: A researcher is investigating whether there is an association between the use of social media in teenagers and bipolar disorder. In order to study this potential relationship, she collects data from people who have bipolar disorder and matched controls without the disorder. She then asks how much on average these individuals used social media in the 3 years prior to their diagnosis. This continuous data is divided into 2 groups: those who used more than 2 hours per day and those who used less than 2 hours per day. She finds that out of 1000 subjects, 500 had bipolar disorder of which 300 used social media more than 2 hours per day. She also finds that 400 subjects who did not have the disorder also did not use social media more than 2 hours per day. Which of the following is the odds ratio for development of bipolar disorder after being exposed to more social media? (C) 1.5 (E) 6 (A) 0.17 (D) 2.25 (B) 0.67
Reason: The odds ratio is calculated by comparing the odds of exposure among those with the disorder to the odds of exposure among those without the disorder. In this case, the calculation involves determining the odds of using social media for more than 2 hours per day for those with bipolar disorder (300 out of 200) versus those without it (600 out of 400). Simplifying those odds results in an odds ratio of 6, indicating a strong association between higher social media use and bipolar disorder in this study population.

Question: A 5-year-old boy presents to a pediatric orthopedic surgeon for evaluation of spinal curvature. His primary care physician noticed during an annual checkup that the boy's shoulders were uneven, and radiograph revealed early onset scoliosis. His past medical history is significant for multiple fractures as well as short stature. Based on the early presentation of scoliosis and the unusual history of fractures, the surgeon orders further workup and discovers a genetic mutation in an extracellular protein. This protein exists in two different forms. The first is an insoluble dimer that is linked by disulfide bonds and links integrins to the extracellular matrix. The second is a soluble protein that assists with clotting. Based on these descriptions, which of the following proteins is most likely mutated in this patient? (B) Fibrillin (E) Type 3 collagen (A) Dermatan sulfate (C) Fibronectin (D) Type 1 collagen
Reason: The clinical scenario and descriptions provided point towards a mutation affecting the extracellular matrix proteins involved in structural integrity and connective tissue function. Fibronectin is known to exist in both soluble and insoluble forms, linking integrins to the extracellular matrix and also playing a role in clotting, which matches the descriptions in the question. Therefore, based on the symptoms of scoliosis and recurrent fractures, a mutation in fibronectin is consistent with the underlying pathological processes.

Question: A 45-year-old man comes to the clinic concerned about his recent exposure to radon. He heard from his co-worker that radon exposure can cause lung cancer. He brings in a study concerning the risks of radon exposure. In the study, there were 300 patients exposed to radon, and 18 developed lung cancer over a 10-year period. To compare, there were 500 patients without radon exposure and 11 developed lung cancer over the same 10-year period. If we know that 0.05% of the population has been exposed to radon, what is the attributable risk percent for developing lung cancer over a 10 year period after radon exposure? (E) 63.3% (D) 6.0% (B) 2.2% (A) 0.31% (C) 3.8%
Reason: To determine the attributable risk percent for developing lung cancer due to radon exposure, we can analyze the data presented. The attributable risk percent (ARP) can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{ARP} = \left( \frac{(I_e - I_u)}{I_e} \right) \times 100 \]

where \( I_e \) is the incidence rate of lung cancer in the exposed group, and \( I_u \) is the incidence rate in the unexposed group. From the data: 

- In the radon-exposed group, 18 out of 300 developed lung cancer, giving an incidence rate of \( I_e = \frac{18}{300} = 0.06 \) or 6%.
- In the unexposed group, 11 out of 500 developed lung cancer, giving an incidence rate of \( I_u = \frac{11}{500} = 0.022 \) or 2.2%.

Plugging these values into the ARP formula:

\[ \text{ARP} = \left( \frac{(0.06 - 0.022)}{0.06} \right) \times 100 \approx 63.3\% \]

Thus, the attributable risk percent indicates that a significant portion of lung cancer cases in the exposed group can be attributed to radon exposure.

Question: A 58-year-old man comes to the emergency department for complaints of crushing chest pain for 4 hours. He was shoveling snow outside when the pain started. It is rated 7/10 and radiates to his left arm. An electrocardiogram (ECG) demonstrates ST-segment elevation in leads V2-4. He subsequently undergoes percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and is discharged with aspirin, clopidogrel, carvedilol, atorvastatin, and lisinopril. Five days later, the patient is brought to the emergency department by his wife with complaints of dizziness. He reports lightheadedness and palpitations for the past 2 hours but otherwise feels fine. His temperature is 99.7°F (37.6°C), blood pressure is 95/55 mmHg, pulse is 105/min, and respirations are 17/min. A pulmonary artery catheter is performed and demonstrates an increase in oxygen concentration at the pulmonary artery. What finding would you expect in this patient? (B) Harsh, loud, holosystolic murmur at the lower left sternal border (C) Normal findings (A) Drop of systolic blood pressure by 20 mmHg during inspiration (D) Pulseless electrical activity (E) Widespread ST-segment elevations
Reason: In this clinical scenario, the patient's presentation of dizziness, lightheadedness, hypotension, and palpitations, in conjunction with the recent history of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (MI) and subsequent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), suggests possible complications such as ventricular septal rupture (VSR) due to myocardial ischemia. After an MI, the myocardial tissue can become necrotic, potentially leading to a rupture in the ventricular septum, which results in a left-to-right shunt and can cause a harsh, loud, holosystolic murmur at the lower left sternal border. This finding would be expected in a patient with VSR, making option (B) the correct answer.
Answer: (B) Harsh, loud, holosystolic murmur at the lower left sternal border

Question: A previously healthy 75-year-old woman comes to the physician because of fatigue and decreasing exercise tolerance over the past 6 weeks. She also has intermittent episodes of dizziness. She has never smoked and does not drink alcohol. She takes a daily multivitamin. She appears pale. Physical examination shows a smooth liver that is palpable 1 cm below the costal margin. The spleen is not palpable. Laboratory studies show:
Hemoglobin 9.8 g/dL
MCV 104 fL
Reticulocyte count 0.2 %
Folate 21 ng/mL (N = 2–20)
Vitamin B12 789 pg/mL (N = 200–900)
A peripheral blood smear shows anisocytosis and bone marrow aspirate shows ringed sideroblasts. This patient is most likely to develop which of the following?" (C) Burkitt lymphoma (D) Acute myelocytic leukemia (B) Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (A) Sézary syndrome (E) Hairy cell leukemia
Reason: This patient exhibits signs consistent with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), indicated by her macrocytic anemia, low reticulocyte count, and the presence of ringed sideroblasts in the bone marrow. Patients with MDS are at an increased risk of developing acute myeloid leukemia (AML) due to the underlying dysplastic hematopoiesis which predisposes them to transformation into acute leukemia. Therefore, the most likely progression for this patient, given her clinical presentation, is to develop acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), making option (D) the correct answer.
Answer: (D) Acute myelocytic leukemia
[INFO] Sampling path 10 completed.
[INFO] Opinion paths:
Path 1: To analyze this case step by step:

1. **Patient's Symptoms**: The patient has progressive fatigue and muscle cramps, which can be indicative of electrolyte disturbances, particularly hypokalemia (low potassium levels).

2. **Laboratory Values**:
   - **K+**: 3.3 mEq/L (low potassium, hypokalemia)
   - **HCO3-**: 33 mEq/L (elevated bicarbonate, indicating metabolic alkalosis)
   - **BUN**: 20 mg/dL (mildly elevated, but could be due to dehydration or other factors)
   - **Glucose**: 129 mg/dL (elevated, possibly indicating glucose intolerance or early diabetes)

3. **Medications**: The patient is on hydrochlorothiazide, a diuretic that can lead to hypokalemia.

4. **Hypertension**: The patient has a significantly elevated blood pressure (174/111 mmHg).

5. **Possible Etiologies**:
   - **Aldosterone Excess (Option A)**: Can cause hypertension and hypokalemia due to increased sodium retention and potassium excretion.
   - **Catecholamine-secreting mass (Option B)**: Would typically present with episodic hypertension and other symptoms related to increased catecholamines (e.g., palpitations, sweating).
   - **Impaired kidney perfusion (Option D)**: Could lead to secondary hypertension but would not typically cause hypokalemia.
   - **Increased peripheral vascular resistance (Option E)**: Usually a primary cause of hypertension but does not explain the electrolyte abnormalities.
   - **Cortisol excess (Option C)**: Associated with Cushing's syndrome, which can cause hypertension and hypokalemia due to increased aldosterone-like effects.

Given the hypokalemia, elevated bicarbonate, and the use of hydrochlorothiazide, the most likely underlying etiology of this patient's hypertension is **aldosterone excess**. This could be due to primary hyperaldosteronism, which is characterized by hypertension, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis.

Thus, the answer is:
**(A) Aldosterone excess**.
Path 2: Let's analyze the information step by step.

1. **Patient History**: The patient is a 56-year-old man with a history of hypertension, now presenting with progressive fatigue and muscle cramps.
   
2. **Medication**: He is on hydrochlorothiazide, which is a thiazide diuretic that can cause hypokalemia (low potassium levels).

3. **Vital Signs**: His blood pressure is significantly elevated at 174/111 mmHg.

4. **Laboratory Values**:
   - Sodium (Na+): 138 mEq/L (normal)
   - Chloride (Cl-): 100 mEq/L (normal)
   - Potassium (K+): 3.3 mEq/L (low, indicates hypokalemia)
   - Bicarbonate (HCO3-): 33 mEq/L (elevated, indicating metabolic alkalosis)
   - BUN: 20 mg/dL (slightly elevated)
   - Glucose: 129 mg/dL (indicating possible hyperglycemia)

5. **Symptoms**: The muscle cramps and fatigue may be attributed to low potassium levels. 

Given these clues, hypokalemia in the context of hypertension raises suspicion for an underlying condition such as primary hyperaldosteronism (Conn's syndrome), where there is excess aldosterone production leading to sodium retention, potassium loss, and increased blood pressure.

Thus, the most likely underlying etiology of this patient's hypertension is:

**Answer: (A) Aldosterone excess.**
Path 3: To analyze this case, let's examine the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings:

1. The patient is a 56-year-old man presenting with hypertension (174/111 mmHg) and symptoms of fatigue and muscle cramps.
2. He is on hydrochlorothiazide, which is a thiazide diuretic. One of the side effects of thiazide diuretics is hypokalemia, which is noted in this patient with a potassium level of 3.3 mEq/L (normal range is typically around 3.5-5.0 mEq/L).
3. The bicarbonate level is elevated (33 mEq/L), indicating a metabolic alkalosis, which can also be a consequence of potassium depletion.
4. The history of hypertension and the low potassium levels suggest an underlying condition that leads to increased aldosterone production, which causes sodium retention (leading to hypertension), potassium loss, and metabolic alkalosis.

Given this information, the most likely underlying etiology of this patient's hypertension is:

(A) Aldosterone excess

This condition is often seen in primary hyperaldosteronism (Conn's syndrome), where excessive aldosterone leads to hypertension, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis.
Path 4: Let's analyze the case step by step.

1. **Patient History and Symptoms**: The patient is a 56-year-old man with a history of hypertension who presents with progressive fatigue and new-onset muscle cramps. 

2. **Vital Signs**: His blood pressure is notably high at 174/111 mmHg, which indicates poorly controlled hypertension.

3. **Laboratory Values**: 
   - Sodium (Na+): 138 mEq/L (normal)
   - Chloride (Cl-): 100 mEq/L (normal)
   - Potassium (K+): 3.3 mEq/L (low)
   - Bicarbonate (HCO3-): 33 mEq/L (elevated, indicating metabolic alkalosis)
   - BUN: 20 mg/dL (slightly elevated)
   - Glucose: 129 mg/dL (elevated)

4. **Key Findings**: The low potassium level (hypokalemia) and elevated bicarbonate level (metabolic alkalosis) are particularly significant. Hypokalemia can occur with conditions of aldosterone excess, such as primary hyperaldosteronism (Conn's syndrome), or with the use of diuretics. However, since the patient is on hydrochlorothiazide, which is a thiazide diuretic that can cause hypokalemia, we need to consider other potential causes of his hypertension.

5. **Underlying Etiology**: The combination of hypertension, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis suggests an excess of aldosterone. In conditions of aldosterone excess, the kidneys retain sodium (leading to hypertension) and excrete potassium (leading to hypokalemia).

Given these findings, the most likely underlying etiology of this patient's hypertension is:
Answer: (A) Aldosterone excess.
Path 5: Let's analyze the case step by step.

The patient is a 56-year-old man with a history of hypertension who presents with fatigue and muscle cramps. He is on hydrochlorothiazide, which is a diuretic. The laboratory findings show:

- Low potassium (K+ 3.3 mEq/L)
- Elevated bicarbonate (HCO3- 33 mEq/L), indicating metabolic alkalosis
- Normal sodium (Na+ 138 mEq/L) and chloride (Cl- 100 mEq/L)

The combination of low potassium, metabolic alkalosis, and resistant hypertension suggests a possible case of primary hyperaldosteronism (Conn's syndrome), where excess aldosterone leads to increased potassium excretion and sodium retention, contributing to hypertension.

Given these findings, the most likely underlying etiology of this patient's hypertension is:

(A) Aldosterone excess

Thus, the answer is: **(A) Aldosterone excess**.
Path 6: To determine the underlying etiology of this patient's hypertension, let's analyze the provided information step by step.

1. **Patient's History**: The patient has a history of hypertension and is on hydrochlorothiazide, which is a diuretic that can lead to electrolyte imbalances, particularly affecting potassium levels.

2. **Symptoms**: The patient presents with fatigue and muscle cramps, which can be indicative of low potassium levels (hypokalemia).

3. **Laboratory Results**:
   - Serum potassium level is 3.3 mEq/L, indicating hypokalemia.
   - Bicarbonate level is 33 mEq/L, which suggests metabolic alkalosis.
   - The sodium and chloride levels are within normal limits.

4. **Hypertension**: The patient's blood pressure is significantly elevated at 174/111 mmHg.

5. **Analysis of Causes**:
   - (A) **Aldosterone excess**: This can lead to hypertension and hypokalemia due to increased sodium retention and potassium excretion. Conditions like primary hyperaldosteronism (Conn's syndrome) could explain the combination of hypertension and hypokalemia.
   - (B) **Catecholamine-secreting mass**: This usually presents with paroxysmal hypertension and other symptoms such as palpitations, but it wouldn't typically explain the hypokalemia or metabolic alkalosis.
   - (C) **Cortisol excess**: This would lead to hypertension (Cushing's syndrome) but typically presents with hyperglycemia, hypokalemia, and possibly metabolic alkalosis. However, the clinical picture is more consistent with aldosterone excess due to the potassium level.
   - (D) **Impaired kidney perfusion**: This is more commonly associated with renal artery stenosis and would not typically cause hypokalemia.
   - (E) **Increased peripheral vascular resistance**: While this can cause hypertension, it does not explain the hypokalemia.

Based on the findings of hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, and resistant hypertension, the most likely underlying etiology of this patient's hypertension is **aldosterone excess**.

**Answer: (A) Aldosterone excess**
Path 7: Let's think step by step:

1. **Patient Profile**: The patient is a 56-year-old man with a history of hypertension and presents with fatigue and muscle cramps. He is on hydrochlorothiazide, which is a thiazide diuretic, and has a low potassium level (3.3 mEq/L).

2. **Laboratory Values**: The lab results show:
   - Sodium (Na+): 138 mEq/L (normal)
   - Chloride (Cl-): 100 mEq/L (normal)
   - Potassium (K+): 3.3 mEq/L (low)
   - Bicarbonate (HCO3-): 33 mEq/L (high)
   - BUN: 20 mg/dL (mildly elevated)
   - Glucose: 129 mg/dL (high, indicating possible insulin resistance or diabetes)

3. **Symptoms Analysis**: The muscle cramps and fatigue can be attributed to hypokalemia (low potassium), which is a known side effect of thiazide diuretics. 

4. **Understanding Hypertension**: The patient's elevated blood pressure (174/111 mmHg) suggests that there may be an underlying cause, particularly since he is already on antihypertensive medication.

5. **Potassium Levels and Hypertension**: The combination of hypertension, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis (elevated bicarbonate) suggests a case consistent with hyperaldosteronism (Conn's syndrome), where excess aldosterone leads to sodium retention, potassium excretion, and hypertension.

6. **Conclusion**: Given the low potassium levels, hypertension, and metabolic alkalosis, the underlying etiology of this patient's hypertension is most likely due to **aldosterone excess**.

Thus, the correct answer is: **(A) Aldosterone excess**.
Path 8: Let's analyze the clinical presentation step by step.

1. **Patient History and Symptoms**: The patient is a 56-year-old man with a history of hypertension who presents with progressive fatigue and new onset muscle cramps. Fatigue and muscle cramps can be indicative of electrolyte imbalances, particularly involving potassium.

2. **Medications**: The patient is on hydrochlorothiazide, which is a thiazide diuretic that can lead to hypokalemia (low potassium levels). The potassium level in this patient is 3.3 mEq/L, which is indeed low.

3. **Laboratory Results**:
   - Sodium (Na+): 138 mEq/L (normal)
   - Chloride (Cl-): 100 mEq/L (normal)
   - Potassium (K+): 3.3 mEq/L (low)
   - Bicarbonate (HCO3-): 33 mEq/L (high, indicating metabolic alkalosis)
   - BUN: 20 mg/dL (slightly elevated)
   - Glucose: 129 mg/dL (slightly elevated, suggesting possible insulin resistance or diabetes)

4. **Blood Pressure**: The patient's blood pressure is significantly elevated at 174/111 mmHg, indicating poorly controlled hypertension.

5. **Analysis of Potential Etiologies**:
   - **Aldosterone excess (A)**: This can cause hypertension and hypokalemia. Given the low potassium and high bicarbonate levels, this is a strong possibility. Conditions like primary hyperaldosteronism (Conn's syndrome) could explain the hypertension and electrolyte changes.
   - **Catecholamine-secreting mass (B)**: This could lead to hypertension, but typically would not explain the hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis.
   - **Impaired kidney perfusion (D)**: This could cause secondary hypertension, but it does not explain the low potassium.
   - **Increased peripheral vascular resistance (E)**: This is a common cause of hypertension but does not explain the hypokalemia or metabolic alkalosis.
   - **Cortisol excess (C)**: This could lead to hypertension and hypokalemia (Cushing's syndrome), but the metabolic alkalosis is more characteristic of aldosterone excess.

Given the combination of low potassium, metabolic alkalosis, and hypertension, the most likely underlying etiology of this patient's hypertension is:

**Answer: (A) Aldosterone excess**
Path 9: Let's break down the information given step by step.

1. **Patient's History and Symptoms**: The patient is a 56-year-old man with hypertension who presents with progressive fatigue and muscle cramps. His vital signs show significantly elevated blood pressure (174/111 mmHg) and normal temperature, pulse, and respiratory rate.

2. **Medications**: He is on hydrochlorothiazide, which is a diuretic. One of the side effects of thiazide diuretics is hypokalemia (low potassium levels).

3. **Laboratory Values**: 
   - Sodium (Na+): 138 mEq/L (normal)
   - Chloride (Cl-): 100 mEq/L (normal)
   - Potassium (K+): 3.3 mEq/L (low)
   - Bicarbonate (HCO3-): 33 mEq/L (elevated, indicating metabolic alkalosis)
   - BUN: 20 mg/dL (slightly elevated)
   - Glucose: 129 mg/dL (indicating possible insulin resistance or diabetes)

4. **Interpretation of Laboratory Values**: 
   - The low potassium level (hypokalemia) along with the elevated bicarbonate level suggests an underlying issue with mineralocorticoid excess. 
   - The symptoms of muscle cramps and fatigue can also be linked to hypokalemia.

5. **Possible Causes of Hypertension**: 
   - (A) Aldosterone excess: This would lead to sodium retention, potassium loss, and hypertension. Given the hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis, this is a strong possibility.
   - (B) Catecholamine-secreting mass: This usually presents with paroxysmal symptoms (e.g., palpitations, sweating) and would not typically cause isolated hypokalemia.
   - (C) Cortisol excess (Cushing's syndrome): This could also cause hypertension and hypokalemia, but the metabolic alkalosis is more suggestive of primary hyperaldosteronism.
   - (D) Impaired kidney perfusion: This leads to activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system but does not directly explain the hypokalemia.
   - (E) Increased peripheral vascular resistance: This is a common cause of hypertension but does not explain the potassium abnormalities.

Given the combination of hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, and hypertension, the most likely underlying etiology of this patient's hypertension is:

**Answer: (A) Aldosterone excess**.
Path 10: Let's think step by step. Reason: The patient presents with resistant hypertension (blood pressure of 174/111 mmHg) and hypokalemia (K+ of 3.3 mEq/L). He is taking hydrochlorothiazide, which is a thiazide diuretic that can cause hypokalemia, but the degree of hypokalemia here is significant and suggests another underlying cause. 

The elevated bicarbonate level (HCO3- of 33 mEq/L) indicates a metabolic alkalosis, which can occur with conditions associated with excess aldosterone due to its effects on potassium and hydrogen ion secretion. Given the combination of resistant hypertension, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis, the most likely underlying etiology of this patient's hypertension is aldosterone excess, often seen in conditions such as primary hyperaldosteronism (Conn's syndrome).

Thus, the answer is:
**(A) Aldosterone excess**

A chest X-ray shows a right lower lobe opacity and blurring of the ipsilateral diaphragmatic dome. Skull and pelvic X-rays are performed (see image). Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient’s recent infections? (D) T cell dysfunction (E) Unresolved pneumonia (A) Advanced age (B) Hypogammaglobulinemia (C) NSAID-induced chronic kidney disease
Reason: The patient's recent infections, coupled with anemia and significantly elevated calcium levels (hypercalcemia), raise suspicion for an underlying malignancy, such as multiple myeloma, which can lead to hypogammaglobulinemia. This condition results in a compromised immune response, making the patient more susceptible to infections, particularly respiratory ones, as observed in this case.
Answer: (B) Hypogammaglobulinemia

Question: Four days after admission to the hospital for acute pancreatitis, a 41-year-old man develops hypotension and fever. His temperature is 39.1°C (102.3°F), pulse is 115/min, and blood pressure is 80/60 mm Hg. Physical examination shows warm extremities, asymmetric calf size, and blood oozing around his IV sites. There are numerous small, red, non-blanching macules and patches covering the extremities, as well as several large ecchymoses. His hemoglobin concentration is 9.0 g/dL. A peripheral blood smear shows schistocytes and decreased platelets. Which of the following sets of serum findings are most likely in this patient?
 $$$ Prothrombin time %%% Partial thromboplastin time %%% Fibrinogen %%% D-dimer $$$ (C) ↑ ↑ ↓ ↑ (D) Normal ↑ normal normal (E) Normal normal normal ↑ (B) Normal normal normal normal (A) ↑ ↑ ↓ normal
Reason: The clinical presentation of hypotension, fever, thrombocytopenia, and the presence of schistocytes on the peripheral blood smear suggests a diagnosis of Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), conditions associated with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and increased consumption of clotting factors. In this case, we would expect an increase in prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) due to clotting factor consumption, a decrease in fibrinogen from consumption as well, and an elevated D-dimer indicating increased fibrinolysis, making option (C) the most consistent with the likely underlying pathophysiology.
Answer: (C) ↑ ↑ ↓ ↑

Question: A 28-year-old man presents to his primary care physician after experiencing intense nausea and vomiting yesterday. He states that he ran a 15-kilometer race in the morning and felt well while resting in a hammock afterward. However, when he rose from the hammock, he experienced two episodes of emesis accompanied by a sensation that the world was spinning around him. This lasted about one minute and self-resolved. He denies tinnitus or hearing changes, but he notes that he still feels slightly imbalanced. He has a past medical history of migraines, but he typically does not have nausea or vomiting with the headaches. At this visit, the patient’s temperature is 98.5°F (36.9°C), blood pressure is 126/81 mmHg, pulse is 75/min, and respirations are 13/min. Cardiopulmonary exam is unremarkable. Cranial nerves are intact, and gross motor function and sensation are within normal limits. When the patient’s head is turned to the right side and he is lowered quickly to the supine position, he claims that he feels “dizzy and nauseous.” Nystagmus is noted in both eyes. Which of the following is the best treatment for this patient’s condition? (B) Thiazide diuretic (E) Increased fluid intake (A) Particle repositioning maneuver (C) Triptan therapy (D) Meclizine
Reason: The best treatment for this patient's condition is the particle repositioning maneuver, which is effective in cases of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). The patient's symptoms, including the episodes of intense nausea and spinning sensations triggered by specific head movements, along with the presence of nystagmus, suggest BPPV as the underlying cause, and this maneuver helps to reposition the displaced otoliths within the inner ear.

Question: A 65-year-old woman was referred to a specialist for dysphagia and weight loss. She has a history of difficulty swallowing solid foods, which has become worse over the past year. She has unintentionally lost 2.3 kg (5 lb). A previous gastroscopy showed mild gastritis with a positive culture for Helicobacter pylori. A course of triple antibiotic therapy and omeprazole was prescribed. Follow-up endoscopy appeared normal with no H. pylori noted on biopsy. Her heartburn improved but the dysphagia persisted. She had a myocardial infarction four years ago, complicated by acute mitral regurgitation. Physical examination revealed a thin woman with normal vital signs. Auscultation of the heart reveals a 3/6 blowing systolic murmur at the apex radiating to the axilla. Breath sounds are reduced at the base of the right lung. The abdomen is mildly distended but not tender. The liver and spleen are not enlarged. Electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm with a non-specific intraventricular block. Chest X-ray shows an enlarged cardiac silhouette with mild pleural effusion. What is the most probable cause of dysphagia? (E) Benign stricture (C) Left atrium enlargement (D) Diffuse esophageal spasm (B) Achalasia (A) Thoracic aortic aneurysm
Reason: The most probable cause of this patient's dysphagia is (C) Left atrium enlargement. This condition can lead to compression of the esophagus, particularly if the left atrium is enlarged due to the patient's history of mitral regurgitation and heart disease. The combination of cardiac issues, such as mitral regurgitation and the presence of an apical murmur, along with dysphagia, strongly suggests that cardiac enlargement may be contributing to her swallowing difficulties.
Answer: (C) Left atrium enlargement

Question: A 44-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department for confusion and lethargy for the past 2 hours. Per the husband, the patient was behaving weirdly and forgot how to get to the bathroom at her house. She was also difficult to wake up from her nap. The husband denies any fever, weight loss, headaches, dizziness, chest pain, or gastrointestinal changes. He reports that she had frequent diarrhea over the past 3 days but attributed it to food poisoning. In the emergency room, the patient had a 1-minute episode of seizure activity. Following initial resuscitation and stabilization, laboratory studies were performed and the results are shown below.

Hemoglobin: 13 g/dL
Hematocrit: 38%
Leukocyte count: 7,600/mm^3 with normal differential
Platelet count: 170,000/mm^3

Serum:
Na+: 125 mEq/L
Cl-: 90 mEq/L
K+: 3.2 mEq/L
HCO3-: 20 mEq/L
BUN: 22 mg/dL
Glucose: 101 mg/dL
Creatinine: 1.0 mg/dL
Thyroid-stimulating hormone: 3.2 µU/mL

Path 1: Let's think step by step. 

In this case, the patient has a history of postcoital vaginal bleeding, intermenstrual discharge, and a polypoid mass in the vagina. Importantly, she was exposed to diethylstilbestrol (DES) in utero, which is known to be associated with specific types of vaginal and cervical neoplasms.

The most common malignant tumor associated with DES exposure is clear cell adenocarcinoma of the vagina. This type of cancer typically presents in young women who were exposed to DES during pregnancy and is characterized by the symptoms and findings described.

Therefore, based on the history of DES exposure and the clinical findings, the most likely malignant tumor in this patient is:

**Answer: (A) Clear cell adenocarcinoma**
Path 2: Let's analyze the situation step by step. The patient has a history of postcoital vaginal bleeding, occasional intermenstrual discharge, and a polypoid mass on the anterior wall of the vagina. Additionally, she has a significant history of exposure to diethylstilbestrol (DES) in utero, which is linked to specific types of vaginal and cervical cancers.

Question: A 52-year-old man comes to the physician for a follow-up examination 1 year after an uncomplicated liver transplantation. He feels well but wants to know how long he can expect his donor graft to function. The physician informs him that the odds of graft survival are 90% at 1 year, 78% at 5 years, and 64% at 10 years. At this time, the probability of the patient's graft surviving to 10 years after transplantation is closest to which of the following? (E) 45% (C) 71% (B) 82% (A) 64% (D) 58%
Reason: To estimate the probability of graft survival at 10 years, we can use the survival probabilities given at 1 year, 5 years, and 10 years. Given that the 1-year survival rate is 90%, and the 5-year survival rate is 78%, we can infer that between 1 and 5 years, there is a 12% reduction in graft survival. Similarly, from 5 to 10 years, with a further decline to 64%, this suggests an overall decline rate. By estimating the average rate of decline and applying it to the initial probabilities, we can reasonably conclude that approximately 71% is a plausible estimate for the graft survival at 10 years post-transplant.
Answer: (C) 71%

She has also had increased thirst and frequent urination for 2 weeks. She receives approximately 5 blood transfusions every year; her last transfusion was 3 months ago. Physical examination shows hyperpigmented skin, scleral icterus, pale mucous membranes, and a liver span of 17 cm. Which of the following serum findings is most likely in this patient? (D) Elevated transferrin (A) Elevated hepcidin (C) Decreased transferrin saturation (E) Decreased haptoglobin (B) Elevated ferritin
Reason: The patient in this scenario has beta-thalassemia major and has required multiple blood transfusions, which can lead to iron overload in the body. This excess iron is reflected by elevated ferritin levels in the serum, making option B, "Elevated ferritin," the most likely finding in this patient. Additionally, symptoms such as fatigue, darkening of the skin, and joint pain suggest hemochromatosis, which further supports the elevation of ferritin due to excess iron accumulation.
Answer: (B) Elevated ferritin

Question: A 72-year-old man is taken to the emergency room after losing consciousness. According to his wife, he suddenly complained of fluttering in his chest, lightheadedness, and profuse sweating while walking to the grocery store. He then turned gray, lost consciousness, and collapsed onto the ground. His medical history is significant for a prior anterior wall myocardial infarction 2 years ago that was complicated by severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction. His blood pressure is 80/50 mm Hg, the temperature is 36.7°C (98.0°F), and the carotid pulse is not palpable. An ECG was obtained and the results are shown in the picture. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation is initiated and the patient is cardioverted to sinus rhythm with an external defibrillator. The patient regains consciousness and states there was no antecedent chest discomfort. Cardiac enzymes are negative and serum electrolytes are normal. Which of the following is the best next step for this patient? (D) Intravenous adenosine (C) Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (B) Intravenous magnesium sulphate (E) Temporary or permanent cardiac pacing (A) Intravenous metoprolol
Reason: This patient exhibits signs of a life-threatening arrhythmia leading to syncope and has a significant history of cardiovascular disease, including severe left ventricular dysfunction. Given these factors, an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is the best next step to prevent sudden cardiac death from future ventricular arrhythmias, as it is indicated in patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction and a history of significant arrhythmias or myocardial infarction.
Answer: (C) Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator

Question: A 47-year-old woman presents to the physician with complaints of fatigue accompanied by symmetric pain, swelling, and stiffness in her wrists, fingers, knees, and other joints. She describes the stiffness as being particularly severe upon awakening, but gradually improves as she moves throughout her day. Her physician initially suggests that she take NSAIDs. However, after a few months of minimal symptomatic improvement, she is prescribed an immunosuppressive drug that has a mechanism of preventing IL-2 transcription. What is the main toxicity that the patient must be aware of with this particular class of drugs? (C) Nephrotoxicity (B) Hyperglycemia (D) Osteoporosis (E) Pancytopenia (A) Hepatotoxicity
Reason: The patient is likely being prescribed a drug in the class of calcineurin inhibitors, such as cyclosporine or tacrolimus, which is used to manage autoimmune conditions like rheumatoid arthritis by inhibiting IL-2 transcription. A well-known side effect of these medications is nephrotoxicity, as they can lead to renal impairment by causing vasoconstriction of afferent arterioles, making it crucial for the patient to be monitored for changes in kidney function.
Answer: (C) Nephrotoxicity

Question: A 55-year-old man presents to the emergency department for chest pain. He states that the pain started last night and has persisted until this morning. He describes the pain as in his chest and radiating into his back between his scapulae. The patient has a past medical history of alcohol abuse and cocaine abuse. He recently returned from vacation on a transatlantic flight. The patient has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes per day for the past 20 years. His temperature is 99.5°F (37.5°C), blood pressure is 167/118 mmHg, pulse is 120/min, and respirations are 22/min. Physical exam reveals tachycardia and clear air movement bilaterally on cardiopulmonary exam. Which of the following is also likely to be found in this patient? (D) Elevated lipase (C) Coronary artery vasospasm (B) Coronary artery thrombus (E) Pulmonary artery thrombus (A) Asymmetric blood pressures in the upper extremities
Reason: The answer is (A) Asymmetric blood pressures in the upper extremities because the patient's chest pain and risk factors, including his history of cocaine use and hypertension, raise suspicion for aortic dissection. In cases of aortic dissection, one common clinical finding is a difference in blood pressure between the arms due to the dissection altering blood flow to the upper extremities. This, combined with the patient's presentation, suggests the underlying vascular issue that could lead to such a finding.
Answer: (A) Asymmetric blood pressures in the upper extremities

Question: A 23-year-old man presents to an outpatient psychiatrist complaining of anxiety and a persistent feeling that “something terrible will happen to my family.” He describes 1 year of vague, disturbing thoughts about his family members contracting a “horrible disease” or dying in an accident. He believes that he can prevent these outcomes by washing his hands of “the contaminants” any time that he touches something and by performing praying and counting rituals each time that he has unwanted, disturbing thoughts. The thoughts and rituals have become more frequent recently, making it impossible for him to work, and he expresses feeling deeply embarrassed by them. Which of the following is the most effective treatment for this patient's disorder? (C) Cognitive behavioral therapy and haloperidol (A) Cognitive behavioral therapy and clonazepam (D) Psychodynamic psychotherapy and citalopram (B) Cognitive behavioral therapy and fluoxetine (E) Psychodynamic psychotherapy and aripiprazole
Reason: The answer is (B) Cognitive behavioral therapy and fluoxetine because the patient exhibits symptoms consistent with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), characterized by intrusive thoughts and compulsive behaviors aimed at reducing anxiety. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), specifically exposure and response prevention, is the most effective therapeutic approach for OCD, and fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), has been shown to effectively reduce the severity of OCD symptoms through its action on serotonin levels in the brain.

Question: A healthy 36-year-old Caucasian man takes part in an experimental drug trial. The drug is designed to lower glomerular filtration rate (GFR) while simultaneously raising the filtration fraction. Which of the following effects on the glomerulus would you expect the drug to have? (C) Afferent arteriole dilation and efferent arteriole vasodilation (E) Increased oncotic pressure in Bowman's space (D) Afferent arteriole dilation and efferent arteriole constriction (B) Afferent arteriole constriction and efferent arteriole constriction (A) Afferent arteriole constriction and efferent arteriole vasodilation
Reason: The answer is (B) Afferent arteriole constriction and efferent arteriole constriction because lowering the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) typically involves reducing blood flow into the glomerulus, achieved through afferent arteriole constriction. Simultaneously, if the drug raises the filtration fraction, it would imply increased pressure within the glomerulus, which can occur with efferent arteriole constriction as well, thereby resulting in decreased GFR while maintaining a higher filtration fraction.
Answer: (B) Afferent arteriole constriction and efferent arteriole constriction

Question: A 65-year-old woman comes to the physician for the evaluation of several episodes of urinary incontinence over the past several months. She reports that she was not able to get to the bathroom in time. During the past 6 months, her husband has noticed that she is starting to forget important appointments and family meetings. She has type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with metformin. The patient had smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for 45 years. Her vital signs are within normal limits. On mental status examination, she is confused and has short-term memory deficits. She walks slowly taking short, wide steps. Muscle strength is normal. Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's urinary incontinence? (B) Detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia (A) Bacterial infection of the urinary tract (E) Impaired detrusor contractility (D) Loss of sphincter function (C) Inability to suppress voiding
Reason: The correct answer is (C) Inability to suppress voiding because the patient's symptoms of urinary incontinence, along with cognitive decline and a history of smoking, suggest a neurological cause. This combination is indicative of conditions such as normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), which can lead to the classic triad of urinary incontinence, gait disturbance, and dementia due to impaired communication between the bladder and the central nervous system.

Question: A 35-year-old woman comes to your office with a variety of complaints. As part of her evaluation, she undergoes laboratory testing which reveals the presence of anti-centromere antibodies. All of the following symptoms and signs would be expected to be present EXCEPT: (B) Calcium deposits on digits (D) Hypercoagulable state (C) Blanching vascular abnormalities (A) Pallor, cyanosis, and erythema of the hands (E) Heartburn and regurgitation
Reason: The correct answer is (D) Hypercoagulable state because anti-centromere antibodies are primarily associated with limited scleroderma (also known as CREST syndrome), which is characterized by skin and vascular changes but does not typically lead to a hypercoagulable state. The other options are related to the common manifestations of the disease, such as vascular abnormalities and gastrointestinal symptoms, whereas hypercoagulability is more closely associated with other autoimmune conditions, such as antiphospholipid syndrome.
Answer: (D) Hypercoagulable state

Question: A 24-year-old male is brought in by fire rescue after being the restrained driver in a motor vehicle accident. There was a prolonged extraction. At the scene, the patient was GCS 13. The patient was boarded and transported. In the trauma bay, vitals are T 97.2 F, HR 132 bpm, BP 145/90 mmHG, RR 22 rpm, and O2 Sat 100%. ABCs are intact with a GCS of 15, and on secondary survey you note the following (Figure F). FAST exam is positive at Morrison's pouch. Abdominal exam shows exquisite tenderness to palpation with rebound and guarding. Which of the following radiographs is most likely to be present in this patient? (B) Radiograph B (D) Radiograph D (C) Radiograph C (A) Radiograph A (E) Radiograph E
Reason: The correct answer is (C) Radiograph C because the clinical presentation suggests the patient has significant abdominal trauma with possible liver laceration or injury, indicated by the positive FAST exam in Morrison's pouch (the area between the liver and the right kidney). Radiograph C likely depicts a liver injury or hemoperitoneum, which would correspond with the patient's vital signs and physical exam findings of tenderness, rebound tenderness, and guarding, all suggestive of intra-abdominal bleeding.

Question: A 35-year-old woman is diagnosed with schizophrenia after nine months of experiencing auditory hallucinations and persecutory delusions. Over the next year, she fails to experience symptom relief from separate and appropriately dosed trials of olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone. At this point, which of the following treatment options is most likely to be effective? (C) Clozapine (D) Clonidine (E) Cognitive behavioral therapy (A) Aripiprazole (B) Haloperidol
Reason: Clozapine is indicated for treatment-resistant schizophrenia, particularly in patients who have not responded to at least two other antipsychotic medication trials. Given that the woman has not experienced symptom relief from multiple adequately dosed trials of other antipsychotics, clozapine would be the next recommended option to potentially achieve better management of her symptoms.

Question: A 45-year-old female presents to her primary care physician with a chief complaint of easy bruising and bleeding over the last 6 months. She has also noticed that she has been having fatty, foul smelling stools. Past history is significant for cholecystectomy a year ago to treat a long history of symptomatic gallstones. Based on clinical suspicion a coagulation panel was obtained showing a prothrombin time (PT) of 18 seconds (normal range 9-11 seconds), a partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of 45 seconds (normal 20-35 seconds), with a normal ristocetin cofactor assay (modern equivalent of bleeding time). Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's bleeding? (A) Hemophilia (C) Rat poison ingestion (E) Von Willebrand disease (B) Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP) (D) Vitamin K deficiency
Reason: Vitamin K deficiency is the most likely cause of this patient's bleeding, as evidenced by the elevated prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT), which indicate a problem with the coagulation factors that depend on vitamin K for their synthesis. Additionally, the patient's history of fatty, foul-smelling stools suggests malabsorption, which could lead to a deficiency of fat-soluble vitamins, including vitamin K, especially after her cholecystectomy.
Answer: (D) Vitamin K deficiency

Question: A 2-month-old Middle Eastern female infant from a consanguinous marriage presents with seizures, anorexia, failure to thrive, developmental delay, and vomiting and fatigue after eating. Blood work demonstrated levels of methylmalonic acid nearly 500 times normal levels. A carbon-14 propionate incorporation assay was performed on the fibroblasts of the patient and compared to a healthy, normal individual. Little to none of the radiolabeled carbons of the propionate appeared in any of the intermediates of the Krebs cycle. Which of the following reactions is not taking place in this individual? (A) Propionyl-CoA --> Methylmalonyl-CoA (C) Methylmalonyl-CoA --> Succinyl-CoA (E) Acetyl-CoA + Oxaloacetate --> Citrate (B) Acetyl-CoA + CO2 --> Malonyl-CoA (D) Pyruvate --> acetyl-CoA
Reason: The reaction from methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA is not taking place in this individual due to a deficiency in the enzyme methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, which is responsible for catalyzing this conversion and is dependent on vitamin B12. The significantly elevated levels of methylmalonic acid in the patient's blood suggest that there is a block in this metabolic pathway, leading to the accumulation of methylmalonic acid and a lack of production of succinyl-CoA.
Answer: (C) Methylmalonyl-CoA --> Succinyl-CoA

[INFO] Opinion paths:
Path 1: Let's analyze the situation step by step.

The patient has developed a post-surgical infection characterized by fever, purulent discharge, and the presence of gram-positive cocci in clusters, which suggests a likely Staphylococcus infection (most likely Staphylococcus aureus). The treatment with oral dicloxacillin, a penicillinase-resistant penicillin, is appropriate for Staphylococcus species, yet the patient continues to have high-grade fever and purulent discharge four days after initiating therapy.

Given that the infection is not responding to dicloxacillin, we should consider why the organism might be resistant to this antibiotic. 

1. **Secretion of a pyrogenic toxin (A)**: This would cause symptoms but would not explain antibiotic resistance.
  
2. **Ability to cleave β-lactam rings (C)**: This is a mechanism of resistance seen in some bacteria, particularly those producing β-lactamase, which can inactivate penicillins. Staphylococcus aureus can produce penicillinase, which would explain resistance to certain penicillins.

3. **Presence of an impenetrable outer membrane (B)**: This is characteristic of gram-negative bacteria, not gram-positive ones like Staphylococcus.

4. **Development of efflux pumps (D)**: Efflux pumps are more commonly associated with resistance in gram-negative bacteria and some gram-positive bacteria, but they are not the primary mechanism for Staphylococcus resistance to penicillins.

5. **Adaptation in binding proteins (E)**: This refers to changes in penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) that can lead to resistance in certain bacteria, but it typically relates to other classes of antibiotics, like methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).

Considering the information given, the most likely reason for the treatment failure with dicloxacillin is the organism's **ability to cleave β-lactam rings (C)**, suggesting that the organism is producing β-lactamase, which renders the antibiotic ineffective.

Answer: (C) Ability to cleave β-lactam rings
Path 2: Let's analyze the situation step by step. The patient is experiencing a post-surgical infection characterized by fever, erythema, and purulent discharge. The wound culture shows gram-positive cocci in clusters, which is indicative of Staphylococcus species, likely Staphylococcus aureus.

1. **Antibiotic Choice**: The treatment with oral dicloxacillin is appropriate for infections caused by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), but if the organism is methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), the dicloxacillin would be ineffective.

2. **Reason for Treatment Failure**: Given that the patient continues to have high-grade fever and purulent discharge despite appropriate empirical treatment, it suggests that the organism is resistant to the antibiotic being used.

3. **Options Analysis**:
   - (A) **Secretion of a pyrogenic toxin**: While this can contribute to fever, it does not directly explain antibiotic resistance.
   - (B) **Presence of an impenetrable outer membrane**: This applies to gram-negative bacteria, not gram-positive cocci.
   - (C) **Ability to cleave β-lactam rings**: This is a mechanism of resistance that specifically applies to bacteria that produce β-lactamase enzymes. MRSA, for instance, has altered penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) that confer resistance to β-lactams, but the description does not fit MRSA's primary mechanism.
   - (D) **Development of efflux pumps**: This is more relevant to some gram-negative bacteria and does not primarily explain Staphylococcus resistance.
   - (E) **Adaptation in binding proteins**: This accurately describes MRSA's mechanism of resistance, as it has altered PBPs that do not bind to β-lactam antibiotics effectively.

Given this analysis, the most likely characteristic of the infecting organism that explains the failure to improve with antibiotic therapy is:

**Answer: (E) Adaptation in binding proteins.** 

This indicates that the organism is likely MRSA, which does not respond to β-lactam antibiotics due to altered penicillin-binding proteins.
Path 3: Let's analyze the situation step by step.

The patient has developed a postoperative infection with purulent discharge from the surgical site, and the wound culture shows gram-positive cocci in clusters. Given these characteristics, the likely organism is Staphylococcus aureus, which is known to cause skin and soft tissue infections, especially after surgical procedures. 

He was started on oral dicloxacillin, which is a penicillin antibiotic effective against Staphylococcus species. However, the patient's condition did not improve, indicating that the antibiotic therapy was ineffective.

Now, let's evaluate the options provided:

(A) Secretion of a pyrogenic toxin: This is more related to the inflammatory response and symptoms but does not directly explain antibiotic resistance.

(B) Ability to cleave β-lactam rings: This is a characteristic of bacteria that produce β-lactamase, which allows them to resist β-lactam antibiotics. Staphylococcus aureus can produce β-lactamase, which could explain the failure of dicloxacillin to treat the infection.

(C) Presence of an impenetrable outer membrane: This option is more relevant to gram-negative bacteria, not gram-positive cocci.

(D) Development of efflux pumps: This mechanism is more common in gram-negative bacteria and certain resistant strains, but it is not a primary concern with Staphylococcus aureus.

(E) Adaptation in binding proteins: This could relate to changes in penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), particularly in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), which would confer resistance to β-lactam antibiotics.

Given the information, the best explanation for the failure of dicloxacillin to improve the patient's condition is:

**Answer: (B) Ability to cleave β-lactam rings.**

This characteristic suggests that the infecting organism (likely Staphylococcus aureus) may produce β-lactamase, rendering dicloxacillin ineffective in treating the infection.
Path 4: Let's analyze the information step by step. 

The patient shows signs of a postoperative infection characterized by fever, purulent discharge, and the presence of gram-positive cocci in clusters from the wound culture. This suggests that the infecting organism is likely Staphylococcus aureus, which is known to be a common cause of surgical site infections and can be resistant to certain antibiotics.

The treatment with oral dicloxacillin is aimed at treating infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus; however, the patient's condition is not improving, indicating antibiotic resistance.

Now let's evaluate the options:

(A) Secretion of a pyrogenic toxin - While some bacteria can secrete toxins that cause fever, this does not directly explain antibiotic resistance.

(B) Presence of an impenetrable outer membrane - This characteristic is more typical of gram-negative bacteria, not gram-positive cocci.

(C) Ability to cleave β-lactam rings - This is a hallmark of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria, which can render beta-lactam antibiotics (like dicloxacillin) ineffective. If the organism can produce enzymes that break down the antibiotic, this would explain the failure of treatment.

(D) Development of efflux pumps - This is a mechanism seen in some bacteria, but it is more common in gram-negative bacteria and would not typically apply to the resistance seen in staphylococci.

(E) Adaptation in binding proteins - This could be relevant if we were discussing MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), which alters its penicillin-binding proteins to evade beta-lactam antibiotics.

Given the context of the scenario, the best explanation for the failure to improve with antibiotic therapy is (C) Ability to cleave β-lactam rings, as this directly relates to the resistance mechanism that would prevent dicloxacillin from being effective.

Answer: (C) Ability to cleave β-lactam rings
Path 5: Let's analyze the situation step by step.

The patient has developed a post-surgical infection characterized by fever, purulent discharge, and the presence of gram-positive cocci in clusters from the wound culture. Given the characteristics of the organism and the treatment initiated with oral dicloxacillin, we suspect that the organism is likely Staphylococcus aureus, which is commonly associated with such infections.

Now, let's evaluate the options provided:

(A) Secretion of a pyrogenic toxin: While some bacteria can secrete toxins that contribute to fever and other symptoms, this does not directly explain the failure of the antibiotic treatment.

(B) Presence of an impenetrable outer membrane: This is true for gram-negative bacteria, not gram-positive cocci, so this does not apply to the organism in question.

(C) Ability to cleave β-lactam rings: This refers to the production of β-lactamase, an enzyme that can inactivate penicillins and other β-lactam antibiotics. If the organism is Staphylococcus aureus that produces penicillinase (a type of β-lactamase), this would explain the failure to respond to dicloxacillin.

(D) Development of efflux pumps: This is more relevant to some gram-negative bacteria and some resistant strains, but it is less commonly associated with the primary organisms we suspect here.

(E) Adaptation in binding proteins: This could refer to alterations in penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) leading to methicillin resistance, especially in MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus). However, the question does not provide enough detail to confirm that this is the mechanism at play.

Considering the context of the patient's ongoing infection despite antibiotic therapy, the best explanation is:

**Answer: (C) Ability to cleave β-lactam rings.**

This option indicates that the organism can produce β-lactamase, which would render dicloxacillin ineffective and explain the lack of clinical improvement.
Path 6: Let's analyze the situation step by step. The patient has developed a postoperative infection with purulent discharge, and the wound culture shows gram-positive cocci in clusters, which is characteristic of Staphylococcus aureus. The treatment with oral dicloxacillin, which is a penicillinase-resistant penicillin effective against Staphylococcus aureus, has not resulted in improvement after four days.

Given this context, we need to determine the characteristic of the infecting organism that explains the failure of the antibiotic therapy. 

1. **Secretion of a pyrogenic toxin (A)**: While some strains of Staphylococcus aureus can secrete toxins that lead to fever and other systemic effects, this does not directly explain the failure to clear the infection with antibiotics.
  
2. **Ability to cleave β-lactam rings (C)**: This option refers to the production of β-lactamase, which can inactivate many β-lactam antibiotics including penicillins. If the organism is producing β-lactamase, it could explain why dicloxacillin (a β-lactam antibiotic) is ineffective.

3. **Presence of an impenetrable outer membrane (B)**: This is more characteristic of gram-negative bacteria, which have a protective outer membrane that can prevent antibiotics from entering the cell. Gram-positive bacteria do not have this outer membrane.

4. **Development of efflux pumps (D)**: This mechanism is more commonly associated with gram-negative bacteria and some resistant strains, but is not a primary mechanism for Staphylococcus aureus.

5. **Adaptation in binding proteins (E)**: This mechanism can refer to changes in penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) that reduce the effectiveness of β-lactam antibiotics, but it is not as common as β-lactamase production in Staphylococcus aureus.

Considering the evidence, the most likely explanation for the failure to improve with antibiotic therapy is the organism's ability to cleave β-lactam rings, indicating the presence of β-lactamase, which would render the antibiotic ineffective.

Thus, the answer is:
**(C) Ability to cleave β-lactam rings.**
Path 7: Let's analyze the situation step by step. 

The patient's symptoms suggest a post-surgical infection, and the wound culture shows gram-positive cocci in clusters, which is typically indicative of Staphylococcus aureus, especially methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). 

Given that the patient has not improved with oral dicloxacillin, which is a penicillinase-resistant penicillin effective against some strains of Staphylococcus aureus, the likely explanation for the treatment failure revolves around the organism's resistance mechanisms.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

(A) Secretion of a pyrogenic toxin - While some bacteria can secrete toxins that contribute to disease severity, this does not typically explain resistance to antibiotics.

(B) Presence of an impenetrable outer membrane - This is characteristic of gram-negative bacteria, not gram-positive cocci.

(C) Ability to cleave β-lactam rings - This is a mechanism of resistance for some bacteria, particularly those that produce β-lactamase enzymes. Staphylococcus aureus can produce β-lactamase, leading to resistance against certain β-lactam antibiotics, including penicillins.

(D) Development of efflux pumps - This is more commonly associated with gram-negative bacteria or certain specific pathogens.

(E) Adaptation in binding proteins - This refers to changes in penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) that can occur in MRSA, leading to resistance against methicillin and other β-lactam antibiotics.

Considering the culture results and the failure to respond to dicloxacillin, the most plausible explanation is that the organism is likely MRSA, which has developed resistance due to the alteration in binding proteins.

Thus, the best answer is:

Answer: (E) Adaptation in binding proteins
Path 8: Let's analyze the situation step by step:

The patient developed a surgical site infection after an open reduction and internal fixation of a femur fracture, and the culture revealed gram-positive cocci in clusters. These characteristics are consistent with Staphylococcus aureus, which is commonly responsible for post-surgical infections.

The patient was treated with oral dicloxacillin, which is a penicillin antibiotic effective against Staphylococcus aureus, particularly methicillin-sensitive strains (MSSA). However, the fact that the patient continues to have high-grade fever, pain, and purulent discharge despite treatment suggests that the infection might be caused by a strain that is resistant to the antibiotic.

Now, let's evaluate the options:

(A) Secretion of a pyrogenic toxin - This would cause symptoms like fever but would not explain why the antibiotic is ineffective.

(B) Presence of an impenetrable outer membrane - This is characteristic of gram-negative bacteria, not gram-positive cocci.

(C) Ability to cleave β-lactam rings - This is a mechanism of resistance for certain bacteria, particularly those producing β-lactamase enzymes, which can inactivate penicillin antibiotics including dicloxacillin.

(D) Development of efflux pumps - This is more relevant to resistance mechanisms seen in gram-negative bacteria or some specific gram-positive bacteria but is less common in Staphylococcus aureus.

(E) Adaptation in binding proteins - This option refers to changes in penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) that can confer methicillin resistance (MRSA) to Staphylococcus aureus.

Given that the infection is persistent despite treatment with a beta-lactam antibiotic, the most likely explanation for the failure to improve is that the organism is resistant to the antibiotic due to its ability to cleave β-lactam rings.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: (C) Ability to cleave β-lactam rings.**
Path 9: Let's analyze the scenario step by step. The patient has developed a post-surgical infection characterized by fever, redness, and purulent discharge at the surgical site. The wound culture shows gram-positive cocci in clusters, which is typical for Staphylococcus aureus, particularly Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).

The patient was treated with oral dicloxacillin, which is effective against methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) but not MRSA. The failure to improve after four days of treatment suggests that the organism is resistant to the antibiotic chosen.

Now, let’s evaluate the provided options:

(A) Secretion of a pyrogenic toxin - While this may contribute to symptoms, it does not explain antibiotic resistance.

(B) Presence of an impenetrable outer membrane - This characteristic applies to gram-negative bacteria, not gram-positive cocci.

(C) Ability to cleave β-lactam rings - This is a mechanism of resistance relevant to Staphylococcus aureus, particularly MRSA, which produces β-lactamase enzymes that can inactivate certain β-lactam antibiotics.

(D) Development of efflux pumps - This typically applies to certain gram-negative bacteria and is not a primary mechanism for MRSA resistance.

(E) Adaptation in binding proteins - This is relevant for MRSA, as it alters penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) to reduce the affinity for β-lactam antibiotics.

Considering the context and the common resistance mechanisms of Staphylococcus aureus, the most relevant answer is:

**Answer: (C) Ability to cleave β-lactam rings.** 

This explains the organism's resistance to the antibiotic therapy employed, which is why the patient did not improve.
Path 10: Let's think through the scenario step by step. The patient has developed a postoperative infection with purulent discharge around the surgical site, and the wound culture shows gram-positive cocci in clusters, which suggests that the organism is likely Staphylococcus aureus. 

The patient was started on oral dicloxacillin, which is a β-lactam antibiotic effective against many gram-positive bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus. However, the patient is not improving after four days of treatment.

The key to understanding the failure of antibiotic therapy in this case lies in the characteristics of the infecting organism. Given that Staphylococcus aureus can develop resistance to β-lactam antibiotics through various mechanisms, such as the production of β-lactamase enzymes that cleave the β-lactam ring, this is a likely explanation for the treatment failure.

Thus, the most appropriate answer that explains the failure to improve with antibiotic therapy is:

Answer: (C) Ability to cleave β-lactam rings

Question: A 35-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department by her coworkers after a sudden onset of vision loss. She is a lawyer and lost 3 cases in the past week. Yesterday, she experienced weakness and paralysis of her left wrist. Past medical history is significant for acid reflux. Physical examination reveals 2/4 in reflexes and 5/5 in muscular strength in all extremities. She appears indifferent to her current situation and presents with a flat affect. Slurring of words is absent. CT without contrast and MRI of the brain are unremarkable. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? (D) Major depressive disorder (A) Factitious disorder (E) Conversion disorder (B) Transient ischemic attack (C) Somatization disorder
Reason: Reasoning: The patient's sudden onset of vision loss and left wrist weakness, in conjunction with an emotional stressor (losing multiple cases at work), fits the criteria for conversion disorder, where psychological distress manifests as physical symptoms. Additionally, the absence of any structural abnormalities on CT and MRI strengthens the likelihood that her symptoms are not due to a neurological condition but rather a psychological one.
Answer: (E) Conversion disorder

Question: A 37-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his wife after having a seizure. He has a 1-week history of headaches, blurry vision in his right eye, and muscle pain in his arms and neck. He has no history of a seizure disorder, and his vision was normal until the onset of his symptoms 1 week ago. He has a history of migraine headaches that occur on a monthly basis and are relieved with ibuprofen. He immigrated from Ecuador 6 years ago and often returns to visit his family. He appears confused. His vital signs are within normal limits. Ophthalmologic examination shows subretinal cysts. An MRI of the brain shows multiple small, ring-enhancing lesions in the parenchyma. A lumbar puncture is done; cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows numerous eosinophils and a protein concentration of 53 mg/dL. Which of the following is the most likely direct cause of infection in this patient? (E) Ingestion of eggs after scratching the anal region (C) Ingestion of eggs from dog feces (D) Ingestion of eggs from human feces (B) Ingestion of eggs from cat feces (A) Ingestion of undercooked fish
Reason: Reasoning: The patient's history of migration from Ecuador and the presence of eosinophilia in his cerebrospinal fluid, along with the MRI findings of ring-enhancing lesions, suggest neurocysticercosis, which is caused by the larval stage of the Taenia solium (pork tapeworm). This condition typically occurs due to the ingestion of eggs from human feces, particularly in regions where sanitation may be compromised, thus making option (D) the most likely cause of his infection.
Answer: (D) Ingestion of eggs from human feces

Question: A 30-year-old man presents to the physician after he discovered a raised, red, string-shaped lesion beneath the skin on his right foot. The lesion seems to move from one location to another over the dorsum of his foot from day to day. He says that the the lesion is extremely itchy and has not responded to over the counter topical treatment. He and his wife recently returned from a honeymoon in southern Thailand, where they frequented the tropical beaches. The physician diagnoses him with a parasitic infection and prescribes albendazole for the patient. With which of the following organisms is the patient most likely infected? (D) Strongyloides stercoralis (B) Dracunculus medinensis (C) Necator americanus (A) Ancylostoma braziliense (E) Wucheria bancrofti
Reason: Reasoning: The patient's symptoms—specifically the raised, itchy, and mobile string-shaped lesion on his foot, along with a recent trip to southern Thailand—are indicative of cutaneous larva migrans, which is commonly caused by the dog or cat hookworm Ancylostoma braziliense. This type of infection results from the hookworm larvae penetrating the skin and causing severe itching as they migrate through the epidermis, thereby supporting the diagnosis.
Answer: (A) Ancylostoma braziliense

Question: A 24-year-old man is brought by ambulance to the emergency department after a motor vehicle accident. He was the front seat driver in a head on collision. He is currently unconscious. The patient’s past medical history is only notable for an allergy to amoxicillin as he developed a rash when it was given for a recent upper respiratory infection 1 week ago. Otherwise, he is a college student in good health. The patient is resuscitated. A FAST exam is notable for free fluid in Morrison’s pouch. An initial assessment demonstrates only minor bruises and scrapes on his body. After further resuscitation the patient becomes responsive and begins vomiting. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? (D) No signs of internal trauma (C) Laceration of the spleen (E) Rupture of the inferior vena cava (A) Duodenal hematoma (B) Laceration of the liver
Reason: The answer is (C) Laceration of the spleen because the presence of free fluid in Morrison's pouch (the area between the liver and right kidney) after a traumatic event often indicates intra-abdominal bleeding, which is commonly associated with splenic injury. Additionally, the patient's initial presentation of being unconscious followed by responsiveness and vomiting suggests the potential for abdominal trauma leading to internal bleeding, which aligns with splenic laceration as a common consequence of blunt abdominal trauma.
Answer: (C) Laceration of the spleen

Question: A previously healthy 59-year-old man comes to the physician with a 6-month history of worsening headaches, difficulty chewing, and progressive hearing loss. Examination shows a mildly tender, 1-cm, hard swelling over the left maxilla. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Serum studies show a calcium concentration of 8.5 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase activity of 112 U/L, and parathyroid hormone concentration of 310 pg/mL. Audiometry shows bilateral mixed conductive and sensorineural hearing loss. Which of the following processes is the most likely cause of this patient's condition? (B) Decreased expression of menin protein (A) Increased activity of nuclear factor-κB (E) Decreased activity of carbonic anhydrase II
" (D) Defective synthesis of type I collagen (C) Defective synthesis of dynein
Reason: The answer is (A) Increased activity of nuclear factor-κB because this patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are suggestive of Paget's disease of bone, which is characterized by excessive bone remodeling and is associated with increased activity of osteoclasts, possibly mediated by nuclear factor-κB. The hard swelling over the maxilla, progressive hearing loss, and elevated parathyroid hormone in the context provided suggests that there is an underlying pathological alteration in bone metabolism, consistent with the dysregulation of the NF-κB signaling pathway.
Answer: (A) Increased activity of nuclear factor-κB

Question: A 64-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician complaining of difficulty maintaining her balance while walking. Her husband comes along to the appointment with her, because he feels that she has not been acting herself at home lately. After further questioning him, it is noted that she has recently been voiding urine unintentionally at inappropriate times. If there is suspicion for an intracranial process, what would most likely be seen on MRI and what is the treatment? (E) Constricted ventricles; watch and wait (A) Constricted ventricles; ventricular shunt (D) Dilated ventricles; surgical resection (B) Constricted ventricles; surgical resection (C) Dilated ventricles; ventricular shunt
Reason: The symptoms presented in this case—difficulty maintaining balance and urinary incontinence—suggest a potential condition like normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), which is characterized by a triad of symptoms including gait disturbance, cognitive dysfunction, and urinary incontinence. On MRI, NPH typically presents with dilated ventricles despite normal intracranial pressure, and the most effective treatment is the placement of a ventricular shunt to relieve cerebrospinal fluid buildup.
Answer: (C) Dilated ventricles; ventricular shunt

Question: A 73-year-old man noted a rapid onset of severe dizziness and difficulty swallowing while watching TV at home. His wife reports that he had difficulty forming sentences and his gait was unsteady at this time. Symptoms were severe within 1 minute and began to improve spontaneously after 10 minutes. He has had type 2 diabetes mellitus for 25 years and has a 50 pack-year smoking history. On arrival to the emergency department 35 minutes after the initial development of symptoms, his manifestations have largely resolved with the exception of a subtle nystagmus and ataxia. His blood pressure is 132/86 mm Hg, the heart rate is 84/min, and the respiratory rate is 15/min. After 45 minutes, his symptoms are completely resolved, and neurological examination is unremarkable. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient’s condition? (E) Lenticulostriate artery occlusion (D) Posterior cerebral artery occlusion (C) Middle cerebral artery occlusion (A) Anterior cerebral artery occlusion (B) Vertebral artery occlusion
Reason: This patient's presentation is suggestive of a transient ischemic attack (TIA), characterized by rapid onset neurological symptoms that spontaneously resolve. The combination of dizziness, difficulty swallowing, speech problems, and ataxia points towards a posterior circulation issue, which is commonly associated with vertebral artery occlusion, particularly in elderly patients with vascular risk factors such as diabetes and significant smoking history.
Answer: (B) Vertebral artery occlusion

Question: A 72-year-old man comes to the physician because of several episodes of dark urine over the past 2 months. He has had a 6 kg (13.2-lb) weight loss over the past 3 months despite no changes in appetite. He has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for 30 years. A CT scan shows a heterogeneous enhancing mass arising from the left renal pelvis. Pathologic examination of the lesion is most likely to show which of the following findings? (B) Pedunculated tumor comprised of pleomorphic urothelial cells with severe nuclear atypia (D) Bright yellow tumor comprised of polygonal cells filled with lipids and glycogen (C) Tumor with central scar comprised of large eosinophilic cells with central nuclei (E) Grayish-tan tumor comprised of primitive blastemal cells forming abortive glomeruli (A) Ulcerating tumor comprised of glandular cells within mucinous material
Reason: The clinical presentation of dark urine, weight loss, and the CT findings of a heterogeneous enhancing mass in the renal pelvis are highly suggestive of a urothelial carcinoma, commonly associated with the renal collecting system. In urothelial carcinoma, particularly in the context of a renal pelvis tumor, pathologic examination typically reveals a pedunculated tumor featuring pleomorphic urothelial cells with severe nuclear atypia, consistent with the aggressive nature of this form of cancer.
Answer: (B) Pedunculated tumor comprised of pleomorphic urothelial cells with severe nuclear atypia

Question: A 37-year-old man comes to the emergency department for severe eye pain. The patient reports that he is a construction worker and was drilling metal beams when he suddenly felt a sharp pain in his right eye. Since then, the vision in his right eye has seemed blurry and his eye “has not stopped tearing.” The patient’s medical history is significant for type II diabetes mellitus and hypertension. His medications include metformin, captopril, and lovastatin. He has a mother with glaucoma, and both his brother and father have coronary artery disease. Upon physical examination, there is conjunctival injection present in the right eye with no obvious lacerations to the eyelids or defects in extraocular eye movements. Pupils are equal and reactive to light. No afferent pupillary defect is appreciated. The unaffected eye has 20/20 visual acuity. The patient refuses to participate in the visual acuity exam of the right eye due to pain. Which of the following is the best initial step in management? (D) Tonometry (A) Fluorescein stain (B) Orbital magnetic resonance imaging (C) Patching (E) Topical corticosteroids
Reason: The best initial step in the management of this patient's severe eye pain is to perform a fluorescein stain. This test helps to assess for corneal abrasions or foreign bodies, which are likely given the patient's occupation and history of sharp eye pain following drilling. Identifying any damage to the cornea is critical before proceeding with further treatments.
Answer: (A) Fluorescein stain

Question: A 47-year-old woman presents to the physician with complaints of fatigue accompanied by symmetric pain, swelling, and stiffness in her wrists, fingers, knees, and other joints. She describes the stiffness as being particularly severe upon awakening, but gradually improves as she moves throughout her day. Her physician initially suggests that she take NSAIDs. However, after a few months of minimal symptomatic improvement, she is prescribed an immunosuppressive drug that has a mechanism of preventing IL-2 transcription. What is the main toxicity that the patient must be aware of with this particular class of drugs? (B) Hyperglycemia (A) Hepatotoxicity (C) Nephrotoxicity (E) Pancytopenia (D) Osteoporosis
Reason: The main toxicity that the patient should be aware of with the immunosuppressive drug that prevents IL-2 transcription, likely referring to drugs like cyclosporine or tacrolimus, is nephrotoxicity. These medications are known to have detrimental effects on renal function due to their ability to cause vasoconstriction of the afferent arterioles in the kidneys, leading to reduced renal perfusion and potential kidney injury.
Answer: (C) Nephrotoxicity

Question: A 25-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of a mild headache, dizziness, fatigue, and nausea over the past several hours. She has no history of serious illness and takes no medications. She lives in a basement apartment and uses a wood stove for heating. Her temperature is 36°C (96.8°F) and pulse is 120/min. Arterial blood gas analysis shows a carboxyhemoglobin level of 11% (N = < 1.5). Which of the following mechanisms is the underlying cause of this patient's symptoms? (C) Increased oxygen binding capacity (A) Inhibition of mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase (B) Inhibition of mitochondrial ATP synthase (D) Inhibition of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (E) Increased mitochondrial membrane permeability
Reason: The correct answer is (D) Inhibition of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase because carbon monoxide (CO) binds to hemoglobin to form carboxyhemoglobin, which reduces the ability of hemoglobin to carry oxygen. Additionally, CO specifically inhibits cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV of the electron transport chain), impairing oxidative phosphorylation and leading to cellular hypoxia despite the presence of oxygen in the blood, which explains the patient's symptoms.
Answer: (D) Inhibition of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase

Question: A 32-year-old man comes to the physician for a follow-up examination 1 week after being admitted to the hospital for oral candidiasis and esophagitis. His CD4+ T lymphocyte count is 180 cells/μL. An HIV antibody test is positive. Genotypic resistance assay shows the virus to be susceptible to all antiretroviral therapy regimens and therapy with dolutegravir, tenofovir, and emtricitabine is initiated. Which of the following sets of laboratory findings would be most likely on follow-up evaluation 3 months later?
 $$$ CD4 +/CD8 ratio %%% HIV RNA %%% HIV antibody test $$$ (D) ↓ ↑ positive (E) ↓ ↓ negative (A) ↓ ↑ negative (B) ↑ ↑ negative (C) ↑ ↓ positive
Reason: The correct answer is (C) ↑ ↓ positive because, after starting effective antiretroviral therapy, we would expect the patient's CD4+ T cell count to increase (↑) as the immune system begins to recover, while the HIV RNA levels should decrease (↓) significantly due to the suppression of the virus. However, the HIV antibody test may remain positive for some time even after the virus is suppressed, as antibodies can persist long after viral replication has been effectively controlled.
Answer: (C) ↑ ↓ positive

Question: A 58-year-old woman with refractory gastrointestinal complaints undergoes a bowel biopsy. On histology, the pathologist observes that submucosal glands of Brunner are present in the specimen. Which portion of the bowel was most likely biopsied? (D) Cecum (A) Duodenum (C) Ileum (E) Descending colon (B) Jejunum
Reason: The correct answer is (A) Duodenum because Brunner's glands, which are submucosal glands that secrete alkaline fluid to help neutralize gastric acid, are specifically located in the duodenum. The presence of these glands on biopsy indicates that the sampled tissue is from this portion of the small intestine, as they are not found in the jejunum, ileum, or any parts of the colon.

His medication includes insulin, hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril, metoprolol, daily aspirin, atorvastatin, and nitroglycerin as needed. His vitals include: blood pressure 135/87 mm Hg, pulse 52/min, and respirations 17/min. Coronary arteriography shows a reduced ejection fraction, a 65% stenosis of the left anterior descending artery, and a 75% stenosis of the left circumflex artery. Which of the following is the recommended treatment for the patient? (D) Extended release nitrate therapy (B) Heparin (E) Angioplasty with stent placement (A) Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) (C) Increased beta blocker dosage
Reason: The recommended treatment for this patient is (A) Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) because he has substantial coronary artery disease, indicated by significant stenosis in the left anterior descending and left circumflex arteries, coupled with a reduced ejection fraction, which suggests impaired cardiac function. Given his extensive cardiovascular history and current symptoms, CABG can help improve blood flow to the heart and alleviate symptoms more effectively than pharmacological options alone.

Question: An investigator studying the molecular characteristics of various malignant cell lines collects tissue samples from several families with a known mutation in the TP53 tumor suppressor gene. Immunohistochemical testing performed on one of the cell samples stains positive for desmin. This sample was most likely obtained from which of the following neoplasms? (E) Rhabdomyosarcoma (C) Squamous cell carcinoma (A) Prostate cancer (B) Endometrial carcinoma (D) Melanoma
Reason: The sample is most likely from (E) Rhabdomyosarcoma because desmin is a muscle-specific intermediate filament protein that is typically positive in rhabdomyosarcoma, a malignant tumor of mesenchymal origin that resembles skeletal muscle. The presence of desmin in immunohistochemical staining indicates the differentiation of the cancer cells towards skeletal muscle, which is characteristic of this specific neoplasm.

Question: A 58-year-old man comes to the physician for a 2-month history of increased urinary frequency. Urodynamic testing shows a urinary flow rate of 11 mL/s (N>15) and a postvoid residual volume of 65 mL (N<50). Prostate-specific antigen level is 3.2 ng/mL (N<4). Treatment with a drug that also increases scalp hair regrowth is initiated. Which of the following is the most likely mechanism of action of this drug? (D) Selective alpha-1A/D receptor antagonism (E) Decreased conversion of testosterone to estradiol (A) Decreased conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (B) Gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor agonism (C) Decreased conversion of hydroxyprogesterone to androstenedione
Reason: The most likely mechanism of action of the drug initiated for this patient is (A) Decreased conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) because DHT is a key hormone involved in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and male pattern baldness. Medications like finasteride work by inhibiting the enzyme 5-alpha-reductase, which converts testosterone to DHT, thereby reducing urinary symptoms associated with BPH and promoting hair regrowth in androgenetic alopecia.
Answer: (A) Decreased conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone

Question: A 42-year-old man presents to the clinic for a second evaluation of worsening blackened ulcers on the tips of his toes. His past medical history includes diabetes mellitus for which he takes metformin and his most recent HgA1c was 6.0, done 3 months ago. He also has hypertension for which he’s prescribed amlodipine and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) for which he uses an albuterol-ipratropium combination inhaler. He is also a chronic tobacco user with a 27-pack-year smoking history. He first noticed symptoms of a deep aching pain in his toes. Several months ago, he occasionally felt pain in his fingertips both at rest and with activity. Now he reports blackened skin at the tips of his fingers and toes. Evaluation shows: pulse of 82/min, blood pressure of 138/85 mm Hg, oral temperature 37.0°C (98.6°F). He is thin. Physical examination of his feet demonstrates the presence of 3, 0.5–0.8 cm, eschars over the tips of his bilateral second toes and right third toe. There is no surrounding erythema or exudate. Proprioception, vibratory sense, and monofilament examination are normal on both ventral aspects of his feet, but he lacks sensation over the eschars. Dorsal pedal pulses are diminished in both feet; the skin is shiny and hairless. Initial lab results include a C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 3.5 mg/dL, leukocytes of 6,000/mm3, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 34 mm/hr, and negative antinuclear antibodies. Which part of the patient's history is most directly associated with his current problem? (D) Hypertension (B) Tobacco smoking (A) Diabetes mellitus (E) Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (C) Autoimmune disorder
Reason: The best answer is (B) Tobacco smoking. Smoking is a significant risk factor for peripheral vascular disease, which can lead to poor circulation and result in the ischemic ulcers observed in this patient. The combination of his chronic tobacco use, diminished pedal pulses, and blackened skin at the tips of his fingers and toes strongly indicates that smoking is a primary contributor to his current vascular issues and ulcer formation.
Answer: (B) Tobacco smoking

She says the pain started suddenly after lifting a heavy box 2 days ago. Past medical history is irrelevant. Physical examination reveals a straight leg raise (SLR) test restricted to 30°, inability to walk on her toes, decreased sensation along the lateral border of her right foot, and diminished ankle jerk on the same side. Which of the following nerve roots is most likely compressed? (A) Fifth lumbar nerve root (L5) (E) Second sacral nerve root (S2) (B) First sacral nerve root (S1) (D) Fourth lumbar nerve root (L4) (C) Third sacral nerve root (S3)
Reason: The correct answer is (B) First sacral nerve root (S1). The patient's symptoms, including pain radiating down the posterior right thigh and leg, along with the weakened ankle jerk reflex and sensory loss along the lateral border of the foot, indicate involvement of the S1 nerve root. This is consistent with the anatomical distribution of the S1 nerve root, which supplies sensation to that area and is responsible for the ankle reflex.

Question: A 57-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of a 2-day history of fever and right upper quadrant abdominal pain. Examination shows jaundice. Ultrasonography of the abdomen shows cholelithiasis and marked dilation of the biliary duct. An ERCP is performed and reveals pus with multiple brown concrements draining from the common bile duct. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of the patient's findings? (D) Increased cholesterol 7-α hydroxylase activity (C) Decreased HMG-coenzyme A reductase activity (B) Decreased heme oxygenase activity (A) Increased alanine aminotransferase activity (E) Increased β-glucuronidase activity
Reason: The most likely underlying cause of the patient's findings is increased β-glucuronidase activity (E). This enzyme is involved in the breakdown of bilirubin conjugates, and its increased activity can contribute to the formation of brown stones in the bile, which may be present in infections or obstruction scenarios, like acute cholangitis, as suggested by the patient's jaundice and pus in the biliary duct.
Answer: (E) Increased β-glucuronidase activity

Question: A 24-year-old man is hospitalized for an elective gastrointestinal surgery 24 hours before the scheduled day of surgery. The surgeon has ordered food and fluids to be withheld from the patient from 12 hours before the surgery and the administration of intravenous isotonic saline. Based on his body weight, his fluid requirement for 12 hours is 900 mL. However, the following day, the surgeon finds that 3 pints of isotonic fluid (1 pint = 500 mL) were administered over the preceding last 12 hours. Which of the following options best describes the resulting changes in the volume of intracellular fluid (ICF) and the body osmolality of the patient? (E) No change in ICF volume, no change in body osmolality (B) Increased ICF volume, decreased body osmolality (C) Decreased ICF volume, no change in body osmolality (A) Increased ICF volume, no change in body osmolality (D) Decreased ICF volume, increased body osmolality
Reason: The correct answer is (E) No change in ICF volume, no change in body osmolality because the patient received isotonic saline, which has the same osmolarity as body fluids. Since isotonic fluids neither cause a shift of water into the intracellular space nor out of it, there is no change in the volume of intracellular fluid or body osmolality.
Answer: (E) No change in ICF volume, no change in body osmolality

Question: A study aimed to evaluate the relationship between inflammatory markers and lipid metabolism in individuals with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) recruited 252 patients with RA in a tertiary care hospital. Fasting blood samples were taken for lipid profiling and for the assessment of inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. The relationship between CRP and total cholesterol was assessed using Pearson’s correlation coefficient. A scatter plot between CRP and total cholesterol can be seen in the picture. Based on the scatter plot, which of the following can be correctly concluded about the value of the Pearson correlation coefficient, r, for CRP and total cholesterol? (C) r value is exactly 0 (A) r value is exactly +1 (B) r value lies between 0 and +1 (E) r value is exactly -1 (D) r value lies between 0 and -1
Reason: The correct answer is (D) r value lies between 0 and -1 because a negative correlation is typically expected between inflammatory markers like CRP and total cholesterol in individuals with rheumatoid arthritis. As inflammation may lead to lower cholesterol levels due to effects on lipid metabolism, observing a downward trend on the scatter plot suggests that as CRP increases, total cholesterol decreases, indicating a negative correlation.
Answer: (D) r value lies between 0 and -1

Question: A 25-year-old woman is rushed to the emergency department after she was found unconscious in a house fire. She has no previous medical history available. At the hospital, the vital signs include: blood pressure 110/70 mm Hg, temperature 36.0°C (97.0°F), and heart rate 76/min with oxygen saturation 99% on room air. On physical exam she is unconscious. There are superficial burns on her hands and parts of her face. Her face and clothes are blackened with soot. What is the 1st best step while treating this patient? (C) Administer 100% oxygen (B) Sodium nitrite (E) N-acetylcysteine (A) Penicillamine (D) Pyridoxine (vitamin B6)
Reason: The initial best step in treating this patient is to administer 100% oxygen because she was found unconscious in a house fire, which raises concerns for carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning. Administering high-flow oxygen can help displace carbon monoxide from hemoglobin, thereby improving oxygen delivery to tissues and reversing hypoxia.
Answer: (C) Administer 100% oxygen

Question: A 42-year-old man comes to the emergency department complaining of chest pain. He states that he was at the grocery store when he developed severe, burning chest pain along with palpitations and nausea. He screamed for someone to call an ambulance. He says this has happened before, including at least 4 episodes in the past month that were all in different locations including once at home. He is worried that it could happen at work and affect his employment status. He has no significant past medical history, and reports that he does not like taking medications. He has had trouble in the past with compliance due to side effects. The patient’s temperature is 98.9°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 133/74 mmHg, pulse is 110/min, and respirations are 20/min with an oxygen saturation of 99% on room air. On physical examination, the patient is tremulous and diaphoretic. He continually asks to be put on oxygen and something for his pain. An electrocardiogram is obtained that shows tachycardia. Initial troponin level is negative. A urine drug screen is negative. Thyroid stimulating hormone and free T4 levels are normal. Which of the following is first line therapy for the patient for long-term management? (A) Alprazolam (B) Buspirone (D) Fluoxetine (C) Cognitive behavioral therapy (E) Imipramine
Reason: The first-line therapy for long-term management in this patient is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) because he presents with symptoms suggestive of panic disorder, characterized by recurrent panic attacks and anxiety about future attacks. CBT is an effective non-pharmacological treatment for panic disorder and can help the patient develop coping strategies, thereby addressing his concerns about medication side effects and improving his overall quality of life.
Answer: (C) Cognitive behavioral therapy

[INFO] Opinion paths:
Path 1: Let's analyze the patient's condition step by step.

The patient has liver cirrhosis and presents with confusion, asterixis, jaundice, ascites, and black, tarry stools (indicative of gastrointestinal bleeding). These signs suggest the possibility of hepatic encephalopathy due to his liver disease. 

Now, let's evaluate each option:

- **(B) Ammonia level is the best initial test to confirm the diagnosis**: While elevated ammonia levels can be associated with hepatic encephalopathy, they are not definitive for diagnosis and are not the best initial test. In fact, ammonia levels can be normal in some patients with hepatic encephalopathy.

- **(D) It only occurs in patients with cirrhosis**: Hepatic encephalopathy is most commonly associated with cirrhosis, but it can also occur in patients with acute liver failure or other liver dysfunctions, so this statement is not entirely accurate.

- **(E) Electroencephalography (EEG) usually shows focal localizing abnormality**: In hepatic encephalopathy, EEG typically shows generalized slowing rather than focal abnormalities.

- **(C) It is a diagnosis of exclusion**: Hepatic encephalopathy is often diagnosed after ruling out other potential causes of altered mental status, making this statement true.

- **(A) It carries a good prognosis**: The prognosis of hepatic encephalopathy can vary widely depending on the underlying liver disease and its severity, and it is often considered a serious condition.

Based on the evaluation, the most appropriate answer is:

**(C) It is a diagnosis of exclusion.**
Path 2: Let's analyze the patient's presentation step by step.

The patient is a 59-year-old man with a history of liver cirrhosis and alcoholism, presenting with black, tarry stools (indicating possible gastrointestinal bleeding), confusion (suggesting a neurological issue), jaundice, lethargy, ascites, and asterixis (a sign often associated with hepatic encephalopathy). His liver function tests show elevated AST and ALT levels, which can indicate liver damage.

Given the context, this patient is likely experiencing hepatic encephalopathy, a condition that occurs in the setting of liver failure, particularly in patients with cirrhosis. 

Now, let's evaluate the options provided:

(A) It carries a good prognosis - This is incorrect. Hepatic encephalopathy can indicate significant liver dysfunction and carries a variable prognosis depending on the underlying liver disease.

(B) Ammonia level is the best initial test to confirm the diagnosis - This is misleading. While elevated ammonia levels are associated with hepatic encephalopathy, they are not the best initial test for diagnosis and can often be normal even in cases of hepatic encephalopathy.

(C) It is a diagnosis of exclusion - This is partially true, as other causes of confusion must be excluded, but it is more commonly diagnosed based on clinical criteria in patients with liver dysfunction.

(D) It only occurs in patients with cirrhosis - This is somewhat misleading, as while it is most common in cirrhosis, hepatic encephalopathy can also occur in acute liver failure and other conditions affecting liver function.

(E) Electroencephalography (EEG) usually shows focal localizing abnormality - This is the most accurate statement regarding hepatic encephalopathy. EEG changes in hepatic encephalopathy can show generalized slowing but do not typically show focal abnormalities.

Considering all of this, the best answer to the question regarding a feature of this patient's condition is:

**(C) It is a diagnosis of exclusion.** 

However, it is important to note that in many clinical settings, hepatic encephalopathy may be diagnosed based on clinical presentation and history without requiring extensive exclusion of other diagnoses.
Path 3: Let's think through the details of the case step by step.

The patient is a 59-year-old man with a history of liver cirrhosis and alcoholism presenting with confusion, asterixis, and guaiac-positive stools, indicating possible gastrointestinal bleeding. His laboratory findings show low albumin, elevated bilirubin, and significantly elevated AST and ALT, consistent with liver dysfunction and potential hepatic encephalopathy.

Now let's analyze the options given:

(A) It carries a good prognosis – This is not true for hepatic encephalopathy associated with cirrhosis; the prognosis can be poor, especially as the condition progresses.

(B) Ammonia level is the best initial test to confirm the diagnosis – While elevated ammonia levels can be associated with hepatic encephalopathy, they are not definitively diagnostic or the best initial test.

(C) It is a diagnosis of exclusion – Hepatic encephalopathy is typically diagnosed based on clinical features and is not strictly a diagnosis of exclusion since the clinical presentation is often characteristic.

(D) It only occurs in patients with cirrhosis – While hepatic encephalopathy is most commonly associated with cirrhosis, it can also occur in other conditions causing liver dysfunction.

(E) Electroencephalography (EEG) usually shows focal localizing abnormality – EEG changes in hepatic encephalopathy are typically diffuse and nonspecific rather than focal.

Given the analysis, the correct answer is:

**(C) It is a diagnosis of exclusion**.
Path 4: Let's think through the case step by step.

This 59-year-old man presents with signs and symptoms consistent with hepatic encephalopathy, given his history of liver cirrhosis, black tarry stools (indicating possible gastrointestinal bleeding), confusion, asterixis, and jaundice. 

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

(A) It carries a good prognosis - Hepatic encephalopathy generally has a variable prognosis and can be quite serious, especially in the context of advanced liver disease. This option is likely incorrect.

(B) Ammonia level is the best initial test to confirm the diagnosis - While elevated ammonia levels can support the diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy, they are not specific or the best initial test. This option is misleading.

(C) It is a diagnosis of exclusion - Hepatic encephalopathy can sometimes be considered a diagnosis of exclusion, particularly when ruling out other causes of altered mental status. However, it can also be diagnosed based on clinical presentation, so this may not fully capture the context.

(D) It only occurs in patients with cirrhosis - This is a true statement, as hepatic encephalopathy is primarily associated with liver failure and cirrhosis. However, it can also occur in other acute liver conditions, making this slightly misleading.

(E) Electroencephalography (EEG) usually shows focal localizing abnormality - EEG changes in hepatic encephalopathy are typically diffuse and nonspecific, rather than focal.

Considering the context of the question and the common features of hepatic encephalopathy, the best choice is:

(D) It only occurs in patients with cirrhosis. 

So, the answer is (D).
Path 5: Let's analyze the clinical scenario step by step. The patient has liver cirrhosis, presents with black tarry stools (indicative of gastrointestinal bleeding), confusion (which could suggest hepatic encephalopathy), asterixis (a sign associated with hepatic encephalopathy), and guaiac-positive stool (indicating the presence of blood). 

Given this information, the likely diagnosis is hepatic encephalopathy secondary to liver cirrhosis. 

Now, let's evaluate the provided options:

(A) It carries a good prognosis - This is not true; hepatic encephalopathy can be serious and carries a poor prognosis, especially in the context of liver cirrhosis.

(B) Ammonia level is the best initial test to confirm the diagnosis - While elevated ammonia levels can be associated with hepatic encephalopathy, they are not the best initial test for diagnosis and can be normal in some cases.

(C) It is a diagnosis of exclusion - Hepatic encephalopathy is typically diagnosed based on clinical criteria rather than being a diagnosis of exclusion.

(D) It only occurs in patients with cirrhosis - While hepatic encephalopathy is commonly associated with cirrhosis, it can also occur in other liver diseases and conditions leading to acute liver failure. Thus, this statement is not entirely accurate.

(E) Electroencephalography (EEG) usually shows focal localising abnormality - EEG changes in hepatic encephalopathy are usually generalized slowing rather than focal abnormalities. 

Therefore, the best answer among the options provided is that (B) "Ammonia level is the best initial test to confirm the diagnosis" is the most applicable, as ammonia levels can support the diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy, although they are not definitive.

However, if we strictly consider the context of each option's correctness, the most accurate answer in the context of common clinical practice is:

**Answer: (B) Ammonia level is the best initial test to confirm the diagnosis** (even though it may not be definitive).
Path 6: Let's analyze the information provided step by step.

The patient is a 59-year-old man with a history of liver cirrhosis and alcoholism, presenting with black, tarry stools (indicative of gastrointestinal bleeding), confusion, jaundice, ascites, and asterixis. Given this clinical picture, the patient likely has hepatic encephalopathy, which is a complication of liver failure.

Now, let's evaluate the options provided:

(B) Ammonia level is the best initial test to confirm the diagnosis: While elevated ammonia levels can be seen in hepatic encephalopathy, they are not considered the best initial test for diagnosis, nor are they always elevated in every case of hepatic encephalopathy.

(D) It only occurs in patients with cirrhosis: Hepatic encephalopathy is most commonly associated with cirrhosis, but it can also occur in other liver diseases, so this statement is not entirely accurate.

(E) Electroencephalography (EEG) usually shows focal localizing abnormality: In hepatic encephalopathy, EEG changes are typically generalized slowing rather than focal abnormalities, making this statement incorrect.

(C) It is a diagnosis of exclusion: Hepatic encephalopathy is often diagnosed based on the clinical presentation and can be considered a diagnosis of exclusion after ruling out other causes of altered mental status.

(A) It carries a good prognosis: Hepatic encephalopathy can be serious and has a variable prognosis depending on the severity of liver disease and the underlying condition.

After evaluating the options, the most appropriate answer is:

**(C) It is a diagnosis of exclusion.**
Path 7: Let's analyze the case step by step.

The patient's history of liver cirrhosis and alcoholism, along with symptoms such as confusion, asterixis, and jaundiced skin, suggest he is experiencing hepatic encephalopathy. 

Now, let's evaluate the options:

(A) It carries a good prognosis - Hepatic encephalopathy can vary in severity and is a sign of advanced liver disease. Generally, it does not carry a good prognosis, especially in the context of cirrhosis.

(B) Ammonia level is the best initial test to confirm the diagnosis - While elevated ammonia levels can be associated with hepatic encephalopathy, they are not definitive for diagnosis and can be normal in some cases.

(C) It is a diagnosis of exclusion - Hepatic encephalopathy is not strictly a diagnosis of exclusion, as its symptoms are typically associated with liver dysfunction.

(D) It only occurs in patients with cirrhosis - Hepatic encephalopathy is most commonly associated with cirrhosis, but it can also occur in liver failure without cirrhosis, so this statement is not entirely accurate.

(E) Electroencephalography (EEG) usually shows focal localizing abnormality - EEG changes in hepatic encephalopathy typically show generalized slowing rather than focal abnormalities.

Given this analysis, the best answer seems to be:

(B) Ammonia level is the best initial test to confirm the diagnosis

Although it’s not definitive, it is commonly checked when evaluating for hepatic encephalopathy. However, the question asks for a feature of this patient's condition, and the best choice in terms of association with hepatic encephalopathy is indeed option (B).
Path 8: Let's analyze the case step by step:

The patient presents with:

- Black, tarry stools (suggesting upper gastrointestinal bleeding, possibly from varices due to portal hypertension secondary to cirrhosis).
- Progressive confusion (suggestive of hepatic encephalopathy).
- Asterixis (a hallmark sign of hepatic encephalopathy).
- Jaundice and ascites, which are common in liver cirrhosis.

Given this information, the most appropriate answer to the question regarding a feature of the patient's condition (hepatic encephalopathy) can be evaluated against the options provided:

(A) **It carries a good prognosis**: Hepatic encephalopathy can have variable prognosis depending on the underlying liver function. In patients with advanced liver disease, the prognosis can be poor.

(B) **Ammonia level is the best initial test to confirm the diagnosis**: While elevated ammonia levels can be suggestive of hepatic encephalopathy, the diagnosis is primarily clinical and ammonia levels are not the best initial test.

(C) **It is a diagnosis of exclusion**: This is not entirely accurate. While other causes of altered mental status should be ruled out, hepatic encephalopathy can often be diagnosed clinically based on history and examination findings.

(D) **It only occurs in patients with cirrhosis**: While hepatic encephalopathy is most commonly associated with cirrhosis, it can also occur in acute liver failure and other liver conditions. Thus, this statement is not entirely correct.

(E) **Electroencephalography (EEG) usually shows focal localising abnormality**: EEG changes in hepatic encephalopathy typically show generalized slowing rather than focal abnormalities.

Given the analysis, the best option that reflects a feature of hepatic encephalopathy is **(B)**, as elevated ammonia levels are commonly associated with the condition, even if it's not the best initial test to confirm the diagnosis.

Final Answer: **(B) Ammonia level is the best initial test to confirm the diagnosis**.
Path 9: Let's think step by step:

The patient's presentation suggests hepatic encephalopathy due to liver cirrhosis, characterized by confusion, asterixis, and history of black stools indicating potential gastrointestinal bleeding, likely from portal hypertension or variceal bleeding.

Now, let's evaluate the options:

(A) It carries a good prognosis - This is not correct as hepatic encephalopathy often indicates advanced liver disease and has a variable prognosis depending on the severity and underlying liver function.

(B) Ammonia level is the best initial test to confirm the diagnosis - While ammonia levels can be elevated in hepatic encephalopathy, they are not the best initial test for diagnosis as they can also be normal in some cases. 

(C) It is a diagnosis of exclusion - This is partially correct, as the diagnosis may require ruling out other causes of confusion, but it is typically diagnosed based on clinical features and the context of liver disease.

(D) It only occurs in patients with cirrhosis - This is misleading because while it is most commonly associated with cirrhosis, it can also occur in other acute liver failures or conditions leading to significant liver dysfunction.

(E) Electroencephalography (EEG) usually shows focal localizing abnormality - EEG in hepatic encephalopathy typically demonstrates generalized slowing rather than focal abnormalities.

Given these evaluations, the most accurate choice would be:

(C) It is a diagnosis of exclusion. 

However, it is important to note that hepatic encephalopathy is often diagnosed based on clinical presentation rather than being solely a diagnosis of exclusion. But among the provided options, this is the most fitting statement. 

Final Answer: (C) It is a diagnosis of exclusion.
Path 10: Let's analyze the information provided step by step. 

The patient is presenting with signs and symptoms consistent with hepatic encephalopathy (HE) due to liver cirrhosis and alcohol use. Key points in the vignette include:

- History of black, tarry stools (suggesting upper GI bleeding, likely due to portal hypertension and varices).
- Progressive confusion, lethargy, and asterixis (a classic sign of hepatic encephalopathy).
- The lab results indicate liver dysfunction with low albumin, elevated bilirubin, and elevated liver enzymes.
- The patient has cirrhosis, which is a primary risk factor for developing hepatic encephalopathy.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

(A) It carries a good prognosis - This is incorrect. Hepatic encephalopathy, especially in the context of cirrhosis, often has a poor prognosis and may indicate advanced liver disease.

(B) Ammonia level is the best initial test to confirm the diagnosis - This is misleading. While elevated ammonia levels can be associated with hepatic encephalopathy, they are not used as a definitive test for diagnosis. Moreover, ammonia levels can be normal in some patients with HE.

(C) It is a diagnosis of exclusion - This is partially true but not the best characterization. While other causes of altered mental status should be ruled out, hepatic encephalopathy is often diagnosed based on clinical symptoms and history in the context of liver disease.

(D) It only occurs in patients with cirrhosis - This statement is somewhat misleading. While it is most commonly seen in cirrhosis, hepatic encephalopathy can also occur in patients with acute liver failure or other forms of liver dysfunction.

(E) Electroencephalography (EEG) usually shows focal localizing abnormality - This is incorrect. EEG findings in hepatic encephalopathy typically show generalized slowing and not focal abnormalities.

Given this analysis, the best answer from the options provided is:
(C) It is a diagnosis of exclusion. 

However, it's important to note that while this statement has some truth, the diagnosis is often made based on clinical findings and known liver dysfunction rather than strictly being a diagnosis of exclusion.

Question: A 63-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of a 1-day history of progressive blurring and darkening of her vision in the right eye. Upon waking up in the morning, she suddenly started seeing multiple dark streaks. She has migraines and type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosed at her last health maintenance examination 20 years ago. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 40 years. Her only medication is sumatriptan. Her vitals are within normal limits. Ophthalmologic examination shows visual acuity of 20/40 in the left eye and 20/100 in the right eye. The fundus is obscured and difficult to visualize on fundoscopic examination of the right eye. The red reflex is diminished on the right. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? (E) Vitreous hemorrhage (D) Migraine aura (B) Central retinal artery occlusion (A) Central retinal vein occlusion (C) Cataract
Reason: The most likely diagnosis is vitreous hemorrhage, as the patient's symptoms of sudden blurring and darkening of vision, along with the observation of multiple dark streaks, suggest the presence of blood in the vitreous cavity. Additionally, her history of diabetes, smoking, and migraines may contribute to conditions like diabetic retinopathy or retinal tears, which can lead to vitreous hemorrhage.
Answer: (E) Vitreous hemorrhage

Question: A 46-year-old African American woman presents to her primary care doctor complaining of muscle aches and weakness. She reports a 3 month history of gradually worsening upper and lower extremity pain. She is having trouble keeping up with her children and feels tired for most of the day. A review of systems reveals mild constipation. Her past medical history is notable for hypertension, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and obesity. She takes lisinopril, metformin, and methotrexate. Her family history is notable for chronic lymphocytic leukemia in her mother and prostate cancer in her father. Her temperature is 99°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 145/95 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, and respirations are 17/min. On exam, she appears well and in no acute distress. Muscle strength is 4/5 in her upper and lower extremities bilaterally. Patellar and brachioradialis reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. A serum analysis in this patient would most likely reveal which of the following? (B) Decreased PTH, increased phosphate, and decreased calcium (D) Increased PTH, increased phosphate, and decreased calcium (C) Increased PTH, decreased phosphate, and increased calcium (E) Increased PTH, increased phosphate, and increased calcium (A) Decreased PTH, decreased phosphate, and increased calcium
Reason: The correct answer is (C) Increased PTH, decreased phosphate, and increased calcium, as the symptoms of muscle aches and weakness, coupled with the patient's history of obesity and hypertension, suggest primary hyperparathyroidism. This condition typically presents with elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels, leading to increased serum calcium due to increased bone resorption and renal reabsorption of calcium, while phosphate is often decreased due to the action of PTH on the kidneys, causing phosphaturia.
Answer: (C) Increased PTH, decreased phosphate, and increased calcium

Question: A previously healthy 38-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department by her husband because of left-sided weakness. As she was getting dressed this morning, she was suddenly unable to button up her shirt. When she showed her husband, he noticed that she seemed confused. She has a 3-year history of diabetes mellitus, for which she takes metformin. She had a knee operation 2 days ago. Her temperature is 38.9°C (102°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 17/min, and blood pressure is 138/85 mm Hg. She is confused and oriented only to person. Neurologic examination shows diminished muscle strength on the left side. There are scattered petechiae over the chest, arms, and legs. Laboratory studies show:
Hemoglobin 7.5 g/dL
Leukocyte count 10,500/mm3
Platelet count 40,000/mm3
Prothrombin time 15 seconds
Partial thromboplastin time 36 seconds
Serum
Bilirubin
Total 3.5 mg/dL
Direct 0.3 mg/dL
Urea nitrogen 35 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.5 mg/dL
Lactate dehydrogenase 1074 U/L
A peripheral smear shows numerous schistocytes. Further evaluation is most likely going to show which of the following findings?" (C) RBC agglutination on direct Coombs test (B) Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli on stool culture (E) Elevated fibrin degradation products in serum
" (A) Decreased megakaryocytes on bone marrow biopsy (D) Decreased ADAMTS13 activity in serum
Reason: The correct answer is (D) Decreased ADAMTS13 activity in serum, as the combination of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (evidenced by hemolysis markers such as low hemoglobin, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, and schistocytes), thrombocytopenia, and neurological deficits suggests thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). TTP is characterized by a deficiency in the enzyme ADAMTS13, which leads to the formation of large von Willebrand factor multimers, resulting in excessive platelet aggregation and consumption, hence the presenting symptoms and laboratory findings.
Answer: (D) Decreased ADAMTS13 activity in serum

A chest radiograph shows a focal homogenous opacity in the right lung suggestive of consolidation. Bacteriologic cultures of the blood, nasopharynx, and sputum grew Moraxella catarrhalis. Which of the following is the antibiotic of choice? (E) Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (A) Cefadroxil (D) Linezolid (C) Doxycycline (B) Cephalexin
Reason: The correct antibiotic of choice for this clinical scenario is not accurately identified as Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, given that the causative organism is Moraxella catarrhalis, which is often treated effectively with amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate. In this case, considering the relevance of antibiotic coverage for Moraxella catarrhalis, empirical treatments like amoxicillin-clavulanate or cephalosporins (like Cefadroxil or Cephalexin) are typically preferred. It is essential to choose an antibiotic that effectively targets the organism identified in the bacteriologic cultures while considering the patient's age and clinical presentation.
Answer: (E) Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole

Question: A 3-year-old boy is seen in clinic. He was born at home without perinatal care. He was apparently normal at birth, but later developed failure to thrive and developmental delay. He also has a history of cataracts. His older brother had a myocardial infarction at the age of 18 and is rather lanky and tall in appearance. Laboratory testing of his urine showed an increase in the level of an amino acid. What is the most likely mechanism responsible for this boy's pathology? (E) Inability to degrade branched chain amino acids (C) Decreased in phenylalanine hydroxylase (D) Deficiency of homogentisic acid oxidase (A) Hereditary defect of renal amino acid transporter (B) Cystathionine synthase deficiency
Reason: The correct answer is (B) Cystathionine synthase deficiency, as it is associated with homocystinuria, which can lead to symptoms such as failure to thrive, developmental delay, and cataracts. This condition is caused by a defect in the metabolism of methionine, leading to an accumulation of homocysteine and related metabolites, which aligns with the lab finding of increased amino acids in the urine and the family's history of early myocardial infarction, suggesting a hereditary metabolic disorder.
Answer: (B) Cystathionine synthase deficiency

Question: A 69-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of urinary urgency, nocturia, and progressive pain in his lower back. The pain is worse at night and does not respond to ibuprofen. Rectal examination shows an enlarged, asymmetric prostate with a nodular surface. Prostate-specific antigen concentration is 11 ng/ml (N < 4). A biopsy of the prostate shows a high-grade adenocarcinoma. A CT scan of the pelvis shows multiple osteoblastic lesions of the lumbar spine. The patient is started on a drug that competes with androgens for interaction with the testosterone receptors. Treatment with which of the following drugs was most likely initiated in this patient? (E) Finasteride (D) Docetaxel (A) Leuprolide (C) Degarelix (B) Flutamide
Reason: Flutamide is an anti-androgen medication that acts by competitively inhibiting the interaction of androgens with testosterone receptors, making it an appropriate choice for treating prostate cancer. In this patient's case, where there is evidence of metastatic prostate cancer and high-grade adenocarcinoma, flutamide would be one of the standard hormonal therapies used to decrease the effects of testosterone on prostate cancer growth.
Answer: (B) Flutamide

Question: A 4-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of a progressive headache and neck pain for 2 weeks. During this period, he has had multiple episodes of dizziness and tingling sensations in his arms and hands. A year ago, he underwent closed reduction of a dislocated shoulder that he suffered after a fall. He underwent surgical removal of a sac-like protuberance on his lower back, soon after being born. His temperature is 36.7°C (98°F), pulse is 80/min, and blood pressure is 100/80 mm Hg. His neck is supple. Neurological examination shows sensorineural hearing loss bilaterally and normal gross motor function. Fundoscopy reveals bilateral optic disk swelling. An MRI of the brain is shown. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms? (B) Intraventricular hemorrhage (D) Vestibular schwannoma (A) Medulloblastoma (C) Chiari II malformation (E) Brachial plexus injury
Reason: Chiari II malformation is characterized by the herniation of the cerebellar tonsils through the foramen magnum, which can lead to obstruction of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow and result in symptoms such as headaches, neck pain, and neurological deficits. Given the patient's history of a sac-like protuberance on his lower back, which suggests a possible spina bifida or related defect, along with the neurological symptoms and bilateral optic disk swelling, it is likely that Chiari II malformation is the underlying cause of his symptoms.
Answer: (C) Chiari II malformation

Question: A 29-year-old African-American woman, gravida 4, para 0, comes to the physician for evaluation of recurrent abortions. Each pregnancy resulted in spontaneous abortion in the second trimester. The patient has a history of joint pain, chronic migraines, and recurrent poorly defined, macular skin rashes. She also reports episodes in which her fingers become pale and cold, and then redden. She is sexually active with her husband and does not use contraceptives. The patient works as a landscape architect. Her mother has a history of endometriosis. The patient takes a daily prenatal multivitamin and occasionally sumatriptan. She appears tired. Temperature is 36.5°C (97.7°F), pulse is 65/min, and blood pressure is 110/65 mm Hg. Examination of the hands shows two ulcerations on the tip of the right index finger and multiple tiny hemorrhages under the nails. There is a purple reticular rash on both calves. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis? (B) Hysteroscopy (E) Blood smear for sickle cells (A) Test for cryoglobulins (D) Test for anticardiolipin antibodies (C) Factor V Leiden functional testing
Reason: The presence of recurrent second-trimester spontaneous abortions, combined with the patient's symptoms of joint pain, skin rashes, and episodes of cold fingers, strongly suggests an underlying autoimmune condition, such as antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). Testing for anticardiolipin antibodies is crucial for confirming a diagnosis of APS, which is associated with increased risk of thrombosis and can lead to pregnancy complications, including recurrent miscarriages.
Answer: (D) Test for anticardiolipin antibodies

Question: A 64-year-old woman presents to an urgent care clinic with edema of her lips and difficulty breathing. She reports that she had multiple root canals performed earlier today, and she started to notice swelling of her lips 2 hours ago. The symptoms have now progressed to where she is having trouble breathing. She notes similar episodes in the past after minor procedures such as this. The blood pressure is 118/76 mm Hg, the heart rate is 84/min, and the respiratory rate is 16/min. Physical examination is remarkable for edema of her lips and mild inspiratory stridor. The laboratory results are remarkable for a low level of C1 esterase inhibitor. Of the following options, which is the most likely diagnosis? (D) Hypothyroidism (A) Hereditary angioedema (B) Contact dermatitis (C) Drug-induced angioedema (E) Allergic reaction
Reason: Hereditary angioedema is characterized by recurrent episodes of significant swelling, often triggered by minor trauma or procedures, and can lead to respiratory distress due to laryngeal involvement. The patient's history of similar episodes, the rapid onset of lip edema and respiratory symptoms following dental procedures, along with the low level of C1 esterase inhibitor, strongly indicates this genetic disorder as the underlying cause of her symptoms.
Answer: (A) Hereditary angioedema

Question: A 31-year-old woman presents to the clinic with shortness of breath, palpitations, and fatigue. She has had these symptoms over the last several weeks. She had been tolerating these symptoms until last night when she could not fall asleep due to palpitations. She has a past medical history of infective endocarditis 6 months ago that was successfully treated with antibiotics. She does not smoke or drink alcohol. Her blood pressure is 138/89 mm Hg and her pulse is 76/min and regular. The cardiac exam reveals a soft S1, S3 gallop, a hyperdynamic apex beat, and a pansystolic murmur that radiates to the axilla on auscultation. Echocardiography reveals incompetence of one of the valves. Which of the following sites is the best position to auscultate this defect? (D) 5th intercostal space at the midclavicular line on the left side (B) 4th intercostal space at the midclavicular line on the left side (A) Right lower end of the body of the sternum (E) Medial end of the 2nd intercostal space on the left side (C) Medial end of the 2nd intercostal space on the right side
Reason: The presence of a soft S1, S3 gallop, and a pansystolic murmur that radiates to the axilla suggests mitral valve insufficiency, which is best auscultated at the 5th intercostal space at the midclavicular line on the left side of the chest. This anatomical location corresponds to the area where the mitral valve is most prominently heard, making it the ideal site for detecting abnormalities associated with mitral regurgitation.
Answer: (D) 5th intercostal space at the midclavicular line on the left side

Question: A 45-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his friends because of a 1-hour history of shortness of breath and squeezing chest pain. They were at a party where cocaine was consumed. A diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction is made. The physician stabilizes the patient and transfers him to the inpatient unit. Six hours later, his wife arrives at the emergency department and requests information about her husband's condition. Which of the following is the most appropriate action by the physician? (D) Request the patient's durable power of attorney document (C) Consult the hospital ethics committee (B) Inform the wife about her husband's condition (A) Obtain authorization from the patient to release information (E) Ask the wife for a marriage certificate
Reason: In situations involving patient confidentiality, medical professionals must obtain consent from the patient before disclosing any medical information to third parties, even to family members. Since the patient is still under care and may not have explicitly authorized the sharing of his health information, obtaining authorization ensures compliance with legal and ethical standards regarding patient privacy.

Question: A mother brings her 3-year-old daughter to the pediatrician because she is concerned about her development. She states that her daughter seemed to regress in her motor development. Furthermore, she states she has been having brief episodes of uncontrollable shaking, which has been very distressing to the family. During the subsequent work-up, a muscle biopsy is obtained which demonstrates red ragged fibers and a presumptive diagnosis of a genetic disease is made. The mother states that she has another 6-year-old son who does not seem to be affected or have any similar symptoms. What genetic term explains this phenomenon? (D) Heteroplasmy (C) Genetic heterogeneity (E) Locus heterogeneity (A) Allelic heterogeneity (B) Phenotypic heterogeneity
Reason: Heteroplasmy refers to the presence of more than one type of mitochondrial DNA within a cell, which can lead to varying degrees of severity in symptoms among individuals who inherit the condition. In this case, the presence of red ragged fibers in the daughter suggests a mitochondrial disorder, which often shows a variable expression of symptoms due to heteroplasmy; this explains why the son appears unaffected despite having the same maternal lineage.

Question: A 29-year-old woman presents with shortness of breath and chest pain for the past week. She says her chest pain is aggravated by deep breathing and she becomes short of breath while walking upstairs in her home. She also has been feeling feverish and fatigued for the past week, as well as pain in her wrists, hands, and left knee. Review of systems is significant for a 4.5 kg (10.0 lb) weight loss over the previous month Past medical history consists of 2 spontaneous abortions, both of which occurred in the 1st trimester. On physical examination, there is a pink rash present on over her face, which is aggravated by exposure to sunlight. There are decreased breath sounds on the right. A chest radiograph is performed which reveals evidence of a right pleural effusion. Serum ANA and anti-dsDNA autoantibodies are positive. Urinalysis is unremarkable. Errors with which of the following is most likely to lead to her disease? (B) Intrinsic pathway (D) Fas-FasL interaction (E) Bcl-2 overexpression (C) Necrosis (A) Cytotoxic CD8+ T cells
Reason: The presentation of this 29-year-old woman, including her systemic symptoms, positive autoantibodies, and facial rash resembling a "butterfly rash," is suggestive of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), which is an autoimmune condition. The Fas-FasL interaction is critical for maintaining immune tolerance and preventing autoimmune disease; defects or errors in this pathway can lead to the survival of autoreactive lymphocytes, contributing to the pathogenesis of diseases like SLE.

Question: A 38-year-old woman presents to the physician’s clinic with a 6-month history of generalized weakness that usually worsens as the day progresses. She also complains of the drooping of her eyelids and double vision that is worse in the evening. Physical examination reveals bilateral ptosis after a sustained upward gaze and loss of eye convergence which improves upon placing ice packs over the eyes and after the administration of edrophonium. Which of the following is an intrinsic property of the muscle group affected in this patient? (A) High myoglobin content (C) A small mass per motor unit (D) High ATPase activity (E) High density of mitochondria (B) Increased amount of ATP generated per molecule of glucose
Reason: The symptoms described in this patient, including muscle weakness that worsens with repetitive use and improves with cool temperatures or edrophonium, are characteristic of myasthenia gravis, which affects the neuromuscular junction. The muscle fibers affected in this condition are typically fast-twitch fibers, which have high ATPase activity to support rapid contraction and relaxation, making them more susceptible to dysfunction in an autoimmune context such as myasthenia gravis.
Answer: (D) High ATPase activity

Question: A 38-year-old woman seeks evaluation at the emergency room for sudden onset of pain and swelling of her left leg since last night. Her family history is significant for maternal breast cancer (diagnosed at 52 years of age) and a grandfather with bronchioloalveolar carcinoma of the lungs at 45 years of age. When the patient was 13 years old, she was diagnosed with osteosarcoma of the right distal femur that was successfully treated with surgery. The physical examination shows unilateral left leg edema and erythema that was tender to touch and warm. Homan's sign is positive. During the abdominal examination, you also notice a large mass in the left lower quadrant that is firm and fixed with irregular borders. Proximal leg ultrasonography reveals a non-compressible femoral vein and the presence of a thrombus after color flow Doppler evaluation. Concerned about the association between the palpable mass and a thrombotic event in this patient, you order an abdominal CT scan with contrast that reports a large left abdominopelvic cystic mass with thick septae consistent with ovarian cancer, multiple lymph node involvement, and ascites. Which of the following genes is most likely mutated in this patient? (B) TP53 (A) BRCA1 (C) BRCA2 (E) STK11 (D) MLH1
Reason: The likely mutated gene in this patient is TP53 due to the patient's history of multiple malignancies, including osteosarcoma and the now-suspected ovarian cancer. TP53 mutations are often associated with a variety of cancers and are particularly prevalent in patients with hereditary cancer syndromes, such as Li-Fraumeni syndrome, which can lead to early-onset tumors and multiple types of cancers across a person's lifetime.

Question: A 65-year-old man is brought into the emergency department by his wife for slurred speech and right-sided weakness. The patient has a significant past medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. The wife reports her husband went to bed last night normally but woke up this morning with the symptoms mentioned. Physical examination shows right-sided hemiparesis along with the loss of vibration and proprioception. Cranial nerve examination shows a deviated tongue to the left. What is the most likely diagnosis? (E) Weber syndrome (A) Medial pontine syndrome (D) Wallenberg syndrome (B) Lateral pontine syndrome (C) Dejerine syndrome
Reason: The most likely diagnosis for this patient is Dejerine syndrome, as the presentation suggests a combination of contralateral hemiparesis due to corticospinal tract involvement and ipsilateral tongue weakness due to involvement of the hypoglossal nerve (CN XII), both of which are indicative of a medullary infarction. The loss of vibration and proprioception also aligns with this syndrome, occurring due to damage to the fibers of the medial lemniscus and the hypoglossal nerve in the medulla.

The patient’s heart rate is 82/min, respiratory rate is 14/min, temperature is 37.5°C (99.5°F), and blood pressure is 120/72 mm Hg. The patient appears alert and oriented. Auscultation of the heart reveals no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. The lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. With regard to the varicella vaccine, which of the following is recommended for the patient at this time? (A) One dose of the vaccine (D) Two doses of vaccine (E) Wait until patient turns 50 (B) Serology then administer the vaccine (2 doses) (C) Serology then administer the vaccine (1 dose)
Reason: The answer is (B) Serology then administer the vaccine (2 doses) because, for individuals who are unsure of their varicella history, checking serological immunity is a standard practice. If the serology indicates a lack of immunity, then two doses of the varicella vaccine are recommended for optimal protection against chickenpox, especially considering the patient's new work environment in a childcare setting where exposure risk is higher.
Answer: (B) Serology then administer the vaccine (2 doses)

Question: A 61-year-old woman presents to her primary care provider with complaints of fatigue, weight gain of 5.5 kg (12.1 lb) and intermittent nausea over the past 4 months. She denies any changes to her diet. She has had type 2 diabetes mellitus for the past 27 years complicated by diabetic neuropathy. Vital signs include: temperature 37.0°C (98.6°F), blood pressure 167/98 mm Hg and pulse 80/min. Physical examination reveals bilateral pitting lower-extremity edema. Fundoscopic examination reveals bilateral micro-aneurysms and cotton wool patches. Her serum creatinine is 2.6 mg/dL. Which of the following is the best initial therapy for this patient? (C) Metoprolol (D) Diltiazem (B) Perindopril (A) Hydrochlorothiazide (E) Labetalol
Reason: The answer is (B) Perindopril because this patient has hypertension and is also presenting with signs of chronic kidney disease (elevated creatinine) and diabetic complications such as neuropathy. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors like perindopril are recommended as first-line treatment in patients with diabetes and hypertension because they not only help lower blood pressure but also provide renal protection by reducing the progression of diabetic nephropathy.
Answer: (B) Perindopril

Question: A 62-year-old woman presents with sudden onset of vertigo, difficulty walking, sensory changes on the left side of her face and the right side of the body, and left facial drooping. Her past medical history is significant for hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. On physical examination, there is left-sided Horner’s syndrome, hypoesthesia on the left side of the face, hypoesthesia on the right side of the body, left facial paralysis,  and left-sided limb ataxia, as well as dysmetria. There is also a loss of taste sensation in the anterior 2/3 of the tongue. Based on the above findings, where is the most likely location of the vascular occlusion in this patient? (E) Basilar artery (B) Posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) (A) Anterior spinal artery (ASA) (C) Anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) (D) Posterior cerebral artery (PCA)
Reason: The answer is (C) Anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) because the clinical presentation suggests a lateral medullary syndrome (Wallenberg syndrome) or a variant involving the AICA territory, characterized by vertigo, ataxia, facial sensory deficits, and dysarthria. The specific combination of left-sided Horner's syndrome, left facial drooping, and sensory changes aligns with ischemic conditions affecting the brainstem and cerebellum supplied by the AICA, making it the most likely site of occlusion in this case.
Answer: (C) Anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA)
[INFO] Sampling path 10 completed.
[INFO] Opinion paths:
Path 1: Let's analyze the case step by step:

1. **Patient Presentation**: The 30-year-old man presents with excessive fatigue, weakness, abdominal pain, constipation, weight loss, and notable skin changes (bronze discoloration). His vital signs show bradycardia (pulse of 63/min) and low blood pressure (99/70 mm Hg), which may denote adrenal insufficiency or a similar condition.

2. **Skin Changes**: The bronze discoloration of the skin is characteristic of hemochromatosis or primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease). Given the context and the other symptoms, primary adrenal insufficiency is more likely, especially with the presence of fatigue, weakness, low blood pressure, and gastrointestinal symptoms.

3. **Next Steps in Management**: In suspected cases of adrenal insufficiency, particularly if there is concern for an adrenal crisis (which could be indicated by low blood pressure and bradycardia), immediate treatment is crucial.

4. **Options Analysis**:
   - (E) **Order an ACTH stimulation test**: This is a diagnostic test, not a management step.
   - (D) **Start him on both hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone therapy**: This is appropriate for long-term management but not the immediate next step.
   - (B) **Administer intravenous fludrocortisone**: Fludrocortisone is generally used for long-term management of adrenal insufficiency, not for acute treatment.
   - (C) **Start him on androgen replacement treatment**: This is not indicated in the acute setting.
   - (A) **Administer intravenous hydrocortisone**: This is the most appropriate immediate management step for suspected adrenal insufficiency.

Given the presentation and the need for urgent treatment, the best answer is:

**Answer: (A) Administer intravenous hydrocortisone.**
Path 2: Let's analyze the clinical scenario step by step.

The patient presents with:
- Excessive fatigue and weakness
- Abdominal pain and constipation
- Weight loss
- Bradycardia (pulse of 63/min)
- Hypotension (blood pressure of 99/70 mm Hg)
- Bronze discoloration of the skin

The symptoms and findings suggest a possible diagnosis of primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease). The bronze discoloration of the skin is particularly indicative of increased ACTH levels due to adrenal insufficiency, which can lead to increased melanin production.

Given this clinical picture, the most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous hydrocortisone. This is because patients with adrenal insufficiency can develop adrenal crises, and immediate glucocorticoid replacement is critical.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
(A) Administer intravenous hydrocortisone
Path 3: Let's think through the scenario step by step.

The patient exhibits several key symptoms: excessive fatigue and weakness, abdominal pain, constipation, significant weight loss, and a notable bronze discoloration of the skin. These symptoms are suggestive of primary adrenal insufficiency, also known as Addison's disease. 

In Addison's disease, the adrenal glands do not produce enough hormones, particularly cortisol and aldosterone, leading to symptoms such as fatigue, weight loss, abdominal pain, and hyperpigmentation of the skin due to increased ACTH levels (which stimulates melanogenesis).

Given the concern for adrenal crisis in a patient with suspected adrenal insufficiency, the immediate management involves providing glucocorticoids. The best next step in this situation is to administer intravenous hydrocortisone to quickly provide the necessary cortisol the patient is lacking.

Therefore, the correct answer is: 

(A) Administer intravenous hydrocortisone.
Path 4: Let's analyze the case step by step.

The patient is a 30-year-old man presenting with excessive fatigue, weakness, abdominal pain, constipation, significant weight loss, and bronze discoloration of the skin. The symptoms and the physical examination findings suggest possible adrenal insufficiency or a related disorder, such as Addison's disease. The bronze discoloration is particularly indicative of adrenal insufficiency due to increased levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which stimulates melanocytes.

In cases of suspected adrenal insufficiency, especially if the patient shows signs of acute adrenal crisis (fatigue, hypotension, and potentially life-threatening symptoms), the immediate management should involve the administration of glucocorticoids. 

Given the choices available:
- (A) Administer intravenous hydrocortisone is the most appropriate next step, as it would help to manage potential adrenal crisis or insufficiency and stabilize the patient. 

Thus, the answer is: **(A) Administer intravenous hydrocortisone.**
Path 5: Let's analyze the situation step by step.

The patient is presenting with symptoms that are highly suggestive of primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease), including:

- Excessive fatigue and weakness
- Abdominal pain and constipation
- Significant weight loss
- A bronze discoloration of the skin (hyperpigmentation), which is characteristic of Addison's disease due to increased ACTH production.

He also has signs of low blood pressure and bradycardia, which may indicate adrenal crisis or significant adrenal insufficiency.

In cases of suspected adrenal insufficiency, especially when the patient presents with symptoms of acute adrenal crisis (fatigue, abdominal pain, hypotension), the immediate management is to provide glucocorticoids to address the deficiency and stabilize the patient.

Among the options provided:

- (A) Administer intravenous hydrocortisone is the most appropriate next step in management for suspected adrenal crisis due to primary adrenal insufficiency.
  
Thus, the answer is: (A) Administer intravenous hydrocortisone.
Path 6: Let's analyze the case step by step.

The patient is a 30-year-old man presenting with excessive fatigue, weakness, abdominal pain, constipation, significant weight loss, and bronze discoloration of the skin. These symptoms and the physical exam findings suggest a possible diagnosis of primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease), which is characterized by insufficient production of adrenal hormones, including cortisol and aldosterone.

The key points leading to this suspicion are:
- Fatigue and weakness: common symptoms of adrenal insufficiency.
- Abdominal pain and constipation: can be related to adrenal insufficiency.
- Weight loss: indicates possible chronic illness.
- Bronze discoloration of the skin: suggests increased ACTH levels due to low cortisol, leading to increased melanin production.

Next steps in management for suspected primary adrenal insufficiency, especially in an acute setting, would typically include administering glucocorticoids to address the adrenal crisis. 

Given these considerations, the best initial management step would be to administer intravenous hydrocortisone to quickly provide the necessary cortisol replacement.

Thus, the answer is:
(A) Administer intravenous hydrocortisone.
Path 7: Let's think step by step about this patient's presentation. 

The patient is a 30-year-old man with complaints of excessive fatigue, weakness, abdominal pain, constipation, significant weight loss, and bronze discoloration of the skin. These symptoms, particularly the bronze skin, suggest a potential adrenal insufficiency, specifically primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease), where the body's production of cortisol is insufficient. 

The vital signs show a low pulse rate and a borderline low blood pressure, which could indicate adrenal crisis or significant adrenal insufficiency. Given the presence of symptoms consistent with adrenal insufficiency and the risk of adrenal crisis, the next best step in management is to provide immediate treatment.

Considering the multiple-choice options:
- (A) Administer intravenous hydrocortisone: This is appropriate for treating adrenal insufficiency, especially if there is a concern for an adrenal crisis.
- (D) Start him on both hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone therapy: This is a longer-term management strategy, but immediate treatment is needed first.
- (E) Order an ACTH stimulation test: This would typically be done to confirm adrenal insufficiency, but it is not appropriate to delay treatment while waiting for test results in a potentially critical situation.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient is: 

**Answer: (A) Administer intravenous hydrocortisone.**
Path 8: Let's analyze the case step by step:

1. **Patient Presentation**: The 30-year-old man presents with fatigue, weakness, abdominal pain, constipation, weight loss, and bronze discoloration of the skin. These symptoms are suggestive of adrenal insufficiency, specifically primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease).

2. **Physical Examination Findings**: The bronze discoloration of the skin is a classic sign of Addison's disease due to increased levels of ACTH, which stimulates melanocytes.

3. **Vital Signs**: The patient shows signs of possible slight hypotension (blood pressure of 99/70 mm Hg) and bradycardia (pulse of 63/min), which can be associated with adrenal insufficiency.

4. **Next Steps**: In suspected cases of adrenal insufficiency, particularly if the patient is symptomatic (fatigue, weight loss, hypotension), the immediate management should include administering glucocorticoids to address potential acute adrenal crisis.

Given that this patient is likely presenting with acute adrenal insufficiency, the most appropriate next step in management is to **administer intravenous hydrocortisone**, which will help stabilize the patient.

Thus, the answer is: **(A) Administer intravenous hydrocortisone**.
Path 9: Let's think through the details provided in the scenario step by step. 

This 30-year-old man is presenting with:

- Excessive fatigue and weakness
- Abdominal pain and constipation
- Weight loss (8 pounds in 2 weeks)
- Signs of possible adrenal insufficiency (low blood pressure, bradycardia)
- Bronze discoloration of the skin, which is a sign of increased melanin production often associated with Addison's disease (primary adrenal insufficiency)

Given these symptoms, there is a strong suspicion of adrenal insufficiency. The bronze discoloration of the skin, in particular, points towards primary adrenal insufficiency due to increased ACTH levels that stimulate melanocyte activity.

The next best step in management would be to confirm the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency. The ACTH stimulation test (also known as the cosyntropin stimulation test) is used to assess the adrenal glands' response to ACTH. This test measures how well the adrenal glands respond to ACTH and can help distinguish between primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease) and secondary adrenal insufficiency.

Therefore, the appropriate next step in management for this patient is:

**(E) Order an ACTH stimulation test**
Path 10: Let's analyze the case step by step. 

The patient is a 30-year-old man with symptoms of fatigue, weakness, abdominal pain, constipation, significant weight loss, and physical findings of bronze discoloration of the skin. The combination of fatigue, weight loss, and the bronze skin suggests a possible adrenal insufficiency, particularly primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease), which can lead to hyperpigmentation due to increased ACTH levels.

Given the symptoms and physical findings, the most urgent concern is to confirm the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency, especially since the patient is showing signs of possible adrenal crisis (fatigue, hypotension, and skin changes). The next best step in management for suspected adrenal insufficiency is to administer intravenous hydrocortisone to address the potential adrenal crisis and provide immediate hormone replacement.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**(A) Administer intravenous hydrocortisone.**

Question: A 75-year-old man presents with a tremor in his legs and arms. He says he has had the tremor for ‘many years’, but it has worsened in the last year. The tremor is more prominent at rest and nearly disappears on movement. He also says his family has mentioned that his movements have been slower, and he does feel like he has problem initiating movements. There is no significant past medical history. He says he often drinks wine, but this does not affect his tremors. The patient is afebrile and vital signs are within normal limits. On physical examination, the patient is hunched over and his face is expressionless throughout the examination. There is a ‘pill-rolling’ resting tremor that is accentuated when the patient is asked to clench the contralateral hand and alleviated by finger-nose testing. The patient is unable to play an imaginary piano with his fingers. There is the increased tone in the arm muscles bilaterally and resistance to passive movement at the elbow, knee, and hip joints is noted. When asked to walk across the room, the patient has difficulty taking the first step, has a stooped posture, and takes short rapid shuffling steps. Which of the following drugs would be the most effective treatment for this patient’s condition? (B) Bromocriptine (E) Selegiline (A) Levodopa/carbidopa (C) Benztropine (D) Entacapone
Reason: The symptoms described in the case are characteristic of Parkinson's disease, including resting tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity, and postural instability. Levodopa/carbidopa is the most effective treatment for Parkinson's disease as it directly addresses the dopaminergic deficiency that underlies the motor symptoms of the condition, making it a first-line therapy for managing these symptoms.
Answer: (A) Levodopa/carbidopa

Question: A 17-year-old female is brought to the emergency room by her parents shortly after a suicide attempt by aspirin overdose. Which of the following acid/base changes will occur FIRST in this patient? (B) Anion gap metabolic acidosis (C) Respiratory acidosis (E) Respiratory alkalosis (A) Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis (D) Metabolic alkalosis
Reason: The correct answer is (E) Respiratory alkalosis. In cases of aspirin overdose, the initial phase often involves respiratory alkalosis due to direct stimulation of the respiratory center in the brain, leading to hyperventilation. This hyperventilation decreases carbon dioxide levels in the blood (hypocapnia), resulting in a respiratory alkalosis state before the subsequent development of metabolic acidosis as the overdose progresses and lactic acid accumulates.
Answer: (E) Respiratory alkalosis

Question: An 84-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of lower back pain and lower extremity weakness for 3 weeks. Over the past week, he has also found it increasingly difficult to urinate. He has a history of prostate cancer, for which he underwent radical prostatectomy 8 years ago. His prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level was undetectable until a routine follow-up visit last year, when it began to increase from 0.8 ng/mL to its present value of 64.3 ng/mL (N < 4). An MRI of the spine shows infiltrative vertebral lesions with a collapse of the L5 vertebral body, resulting in cord compression at L4–L5. The patient receives one dose of intravenous dexamethasone and subsequently undergoes external beam radiation. Which of the following cellular changes is most likely to occur as a result of this treatment? (A) Formation of pyrimidine dimers (B) Disruption of microtubule assembly (C) Intercalation of neighbouring DNA base pairs (E) Formation of DNA crosslinks (D) Generation of hydroxyl radicals
Reason: The correct answer is (D) Generation of hydroxyl radicals. The use of radiation therapy, such as external beam radiation, primarily causes DNA damage via the ionization of water molecules in the cells, leading to the formation of free radicals, including hydroxyl radicals. These radicals can then react with cellular components, resulting in various forms of cellular damage and contributing to the therapeutic effects of radiation in targeting cancer cells.
Answer: (D) Generation of hydroxyl radicals

Question: A 57-year-old woman comes to the physician for evaluation of a lump in the right breast that she first noticed a week ago. Biopsy of the mass confirms a diagnosis of a pleomorphic lobular carcinoma-in-situ that is estrogen receptor-positive. The patient undergoes lumpectomy, and treatment with tamoxifen is initiated. Which of the following conditions is most likely to occur as a result of tamoxifen therapy? (B) Osteoporosis (D) Ovarian cancer (C) Myelosuppression (A) Endometrial cancer (E) Cardiotoxicity
Reason: The correct answer is (A) Endometrial cancer. Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that, while it acts as an estrogen antagonist in breast tissue, has estrogenic effects on the endometrium. This can lead to an increased risk of endometrial hyperplasia and eventually endometrial cancer, particularly in postmenopausal women undergoing treatment with tamoxifen for breast cancer.

Question: A 17-year-old girl makes an appointment with her pediatrician because she is concerned that she may have gotten a sexually transmitted infection. Specifically, she had unprotected sex two weeks ago and has since been experiencing painful urination and abdominal pain. Laboratory tests confirm a diagnosis of Chlamydial infection. At this point, the girl says that she wants to personally give permission to be treated rather than seek consent from her parents because they do not know that she is in a relationship. She also asks that the diagnosis not be reported to anyone. What should the physician do with regards to these two patient requests? (C) Contact her parents but do not report to public health agencies (A) Choose based on the physician's interpretation of the patient's best interests (E) Do not contact her parents but do report to public health agencies (B) Contact her parents as well as report to public health agencies (D) Do not contact her parents and do not report to public health agencies
Reason: The correct action is (E) Do not contact her parents but do report to public health agencies. This approach respects the patient's confidentiality and autonomy, as minors have the right to consent to their own medical treatment for sexually transmitted infections. However, reporting to public health agencies is necessary to allow for appropriate monitoring and control of sexually transmitted infections in the community, which is an essential public health responsibility.
Answer: (E) Do not contact her parents but do report to public health agencies

Question: A 45-year-old female who recently immigrated to the United States presents to the community health clinic for episodes of disrupted vision. She is concerned because she knows several people from her hometown who went blind after having these episodes. Over the past several months, she also has developed itchy bumps on her back and lower extremities. Physical exam reveals black hyperpigmented nodules with edema and palpable lymphadenopathy, but is otherwise unremarkable without any visible discharge from the eyes. Her physician explains her underlying disease was likely transmitted by black flies. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient? (D) Nifurtimox (A) Diethylcarbamazine (E) Praziquantel (B) Ivermectin (C) Mebendazole
Reason: Ivermectin is the appropriate treatment for conditions caused by onchocerciasis, also known as river blindness, which is transmitted by black flies. The patient's symptoms of disrupted vision and the presence of hyperpigmented nodules are indicative of this parasitic infection, making Ivermectin the suitable choice as it targets the microfilariae of the Onchocerca volvulus parasite.
Answer: (B) Ivermectin

Question: A 34-year-old woman presents to her OB/GYN with complaints of missing her last 3 periods as well as intermittent spontaneous milky-white nipple discharge bilaterally for the past 3 months. Vital signs are stable and within normal limits. Neurologic examination is without abnormality, including normal visual fields. Serology and MRI of the brain are ordered, with results pending. Which of the following sets of laboratory results would be expected in this patient? (E) Increased prolactin, increased FSH, increased LH (C) Increased prolactin, decreased FSH, increased LH (A) Decreased prolactin, decreased FSH, decreased LH (D) Increased prolactin, decreased FSH, decreased LH (B) Decreased prolactin, increased FSH, increased LH
Reason: In this case, the patient’s missing periods and bilateral nipple discharge suggest hyperprolactinemia, which is often associated with decreased levels of FSH and LH due to negative feedback on the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. Elevated prolactin levels inhibit the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), leading to decreased FSH and LH production, making option D the correct choice.
Answer: (D) Increased prolactin, decreased FSH, decreased LH

Question: A 62-year-old man, who is known to have recurrent thromboembolic strokes, presents to his physician for a routine follow-up visit. While assessing drug compliance, the physician realizes that the patient inadvertently doubled his dose of warfarin 1 month ago. When he is asked about any new complaints, the patient denies any symptoms, including bleeding. The physical examination does not show any signs of bleeding. Based on the patient’s lifestyle, the physician does not consider him to be at increased risk for bleeding. He then orders an international normalized ratio (INR) for this patient, which is 13.5. In addition to temporarily holding warfarin, which of the following drugs is indicated for this patient? (A) Fresh frozen plasma (E) Protamine sulfate (D) Menaquinone (C) Recombinant factor VIIa (B) Phytonadione
Reason: Phytonadione, also known as vitamin K, is the appropriate treatment for a high INR in patients on warfarin therapy, especially when their INR exceeds therapeutic levels like 13.5. This vitamin serves as an antidote to reverse the anticoagulation effects of warfarin by promoting the synthesis of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors in the liver, thereby helping to restore normal coagulation function.
Answer: (B) Phytonadione

Question: A 3-week-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his parents because of a 3-day history of progressive lethargy and difficulty feeding. He was born at term and did not have difficulty feeding previously. His temperature is 39.4°C (103°F), pulse is 220/min, respirations are 45/min, and blood pressure is 50/30 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on 100% oxygen shows an oxygen saturation of 97%. Examination shows dry mucous membranes, delayed capillary refill time, and cool skin with poor turgor. Despite multiple attempts by the nursing staff, they are unable to establish peripheral intravenous access. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? (B) Intramuscular epinephrine (E) Ultrasound-guided antecubital vein cannulation (A) Rapid sequence intubation (D) Intraosseous cannulation (C) Internal jugular vein cannulation
Reason: In this clinical scenario, the infant exhibits signs of severe dehydration and possibly septic shock, indicated by lethargy, poor feeding, high fever, tachycardia, and hypotension. Due to the inability to establish peripheral intravenous access, intraosseous cannulation is the most appropriate next step as it allows for rapid access to the vascular system, enabling immediate administration of fluids and medications, which is critical in managing the child's hemodynamic instability.

Question: Paramedics respond to a call regarding an 18-year-old male with severe sudden-onset heart palpitations. The patient reports symptoms of chest pain, fatigue, and dizziness. Upon examination, his heart rate is 175/min and regular. His blood pressure is 110/75 mm Hg. Gentle massage below the level of the left mandible elicits an immediate improvement in the patient, as his heart rate returns to 70/min. What was the mechanism of action of this maneuver? (C) Decreasing the length of phase 4 of the SA node myocytes (D) Slowing conduction in the AV node (A) Increasing the refractory period in ventricular myocytes (E) Decreasing the firing rate of carotid baroreceptors (B) Increasing sympathetic tone in systemic arteries
Reason: The mechanism of action of this maneuver is (D) slowing conduction in the AV node. The gentle massage below the level of the left mandible likely stimulates the carotid sinus, triggering the baroreflex, which leads to increased vagal tone and subsequently slows conduction through the AV node, resulting in a decreased heart rate. This is a common approach used to manage paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and reflects the body's physiological response to lower heart rate through increased parasympathetic activity.
Answer: (D) Slowing conduction in the AV node

Question: A 42-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 12 month history of progressive fatigue and shortness of breath with exertion. Five years ago, she emigrated from Eastern Europe. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 20 years. She has a history of using methamphetamines and cocaine but quit 5 years ago. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows jugular venous pulsations 9 cm above the sternal angle. The lungs are clear to auscultation. There is a normal S1 and a loud, split S2. An impulse can be felt with the fingers left of the sternum. The abdomen is soft and nontender. The fingertips are enlarged and the nails are curved. There is pitting edema around the ankles bilaterally. An x-ray of the chest shows pronounced central pulmonary arteries and a prominent right heart border. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis? (B) Doppler echocardiography (E) Serologic testing (A) CT angiography (D) Right-heart catheterization (C) High-resolution CT of the lung
Reason: Given the patient's symptoms, including progressive fatigue, shortness of breath on exertion, jugular venous distension, and signs of right-sided heart failure (e.g., loud split S2 and peripheral edema), these findings are suggestive of pulmonary hypertension. Right-heart catheterization is the gold standard for confirming the diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension as it directly measures the pulmonary arterial pressure, helping to establish the cause of her symptoms accurately.

Path 1: Let's think through the details step by step. 

The patient is a 58-year-old man with a history of smoking, hypertension, and diabetes, presenting with a painless lesion on his lower lip that has been present for 3 months. Important factors to consider are:

- The ulcer is located near the vermillion border, which is significant as this area is often affected by squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), particularly in individuals with a history of sun exposure or smoking.
- The lesion is painless and has been present for an extended period (3 months), which raises concern for malignancy rather than benign conditions.
- Other options such as herpes labialis (which would typically be painful and recurrent), aphthous stomatitis (usually painful and not associated with a long-standing ulcer), and traumatic ulcers (which would typically have a clear history of trauma) are less consistent with this presentation.
- Actinic keratosis is more common on sun-exposed areas but typically manifests as scaly lesions rather than ulcers.

Given these considerations, the most likely diagnosis is:

**Answer: (A) Squamous cell carcinoma**
Path 2: Let's analyze the case step by step.

1. **Patient Profile**: The patient is a 58-year-old man with a history of smoking (one pack a day for 20 years) and working outdoors as a fruit picker, suggesting potential exposure to sun and other environmental factors.

2. **Symptoms**: He has a painless lesion on his lower lip that has persisted for 3 months. The lesion is described as a single ulcer near the vermillion border, which raises suspicion for certain types of lesions.

3. **Differential Diagnosis**:
   - **Traumatic ulcer (E)**: Typically associated with a history of trauma; however, there is no mention of trauma in this case.
   - **Squamous cell carcinoma (A)**: Commonly presents as a persistent, non-healing ulcer, especially in individuals with risk factors such as smoking and sun exposure.
   - **Herpes labialis (B)**: Usually presents as painful vesicular lesions, not a persistent painless ulcer.
   - **Aphthous stomatitis (C)**: Typically presents as painful, shallow ulcers, often recurring but not specifically on the vermillion border.
   - **Actinic keratosis (D)**: Can present as a rough, scaly patch but is not typically described as a single ulcer.

4. **Conclusion**: Given the patient's age, smoking history, occupational sun exposure, and the characteristics of the lesion (a painless ulcer that has been present for 3 months), the most likely diagnosis is **squamous cell carcinoma**.

Answer: (A) Squamous cell carcinoma
Path 3: Let's analyze the information provided step by step.

1. **Patient Profile**: The patient is a 58-year-old white man with a significant smoking history (one pack daily for 20 years), which is a risk factor for malignancies, particularly in the oral cavity.

2. **Presenting Complaint**: He has a painless lesion on the lower lip that has been present for 3 months. The fact that it is painless and has persisted for several months is concerning for a potential malignancy.

3. **Location of the Lesion**: The lesion is near the vermillion border, which is commonly associated with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), particularly in patients with risk factors such as sun exposure (which he may have from being a fruit picker) and smoking.

4. **Differential Diagnosis**:
   - **Traumatic ulcer**: Typically painful and would not last for this long without healing.
   - **Squamous cell carcinoma**: Fits the profile of a painless, persistent ulcer, especially given his risk factors.
   - **Herpes labialis**: Would typically present with vesicular lesions rather than a singular ulcer.
   - **Aphthous stomatitis**: Usually painful and self-limiting; not typically found on the vermillion border.
   - **Actinic keratosis**: Generally presents as a dry, scaly patch; less likely to present as an ulcer.

Given all this information, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is:

**Answer: (A) Squamous cell carcinoma**.
Path 4: Let's analyze the information provided step by step.

1. **Patient Profile**: The patient is a 58-year-old man with a history of smoking, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes. He has worked as a fruit picker for 25 years, which may imply significant sun exposure.

2. **Clinical Presentation**: The patient presents with a painless lesion on his lower lip, specifically described as a single ulcer near the vermillion border.

3. **Diagnosis Considerations**:
   - **Traumatic ulcer (E)**: Typically painful and related to trauma or irritation, which isn't indicated here.
   - **Squamous cell carcinoma (A)**: Common in smokers and associated with sun exposure. Painless ulcers on the lip, especially with the patient's risk factors, could suggest malignancy.
   - **Herpes labialis (B)**: Usually presents with painful vesicles and recurrent episodes, not a solitary painless ulcer.
   - **Aphthous stomatitis (C)**: Usually presents as painful ulcers, not typically on the vermillion border of the lip.
   - **Actinic keratosis (D)**: Presents as rough, scaly patches rather than ulcers, but is associated with sun exposure.

4. **Risk Factors**: The patient’s smoking history and potential sun exposure from being a fruit picker increase the risk for squamous cell carcinoma of the lip.

Given these considerations, the most likely diagnosis for the painless ulcer on the lower lip in this patient, especially considering his demographics and risk factors, is:

**Answer: (A) Squamous cell carcinoma.**
Path 5: Let's analyze the information provided step by step.

1. **Patient Profile**: The patient is a 58-year-old white male with a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus, a significant smoking history, and a long-term occupation as a fruit picker, which may suggest sun exposure.

2. **Symptoms**: He has a 3-month history of a painless lesion on his lower lip, specifically an ulcer near the vermillion border. The fact that it is painless and has been present for 3 months is particularly concerning.

3. **Differential Diagnosis**:
   - (E) **Traumatic ulcer**: Typically painful and would be associated with a history of trauma.
   - (A) **Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)**: Commonly presents as a persistent, painless ulcer, especially in smokers and individuals with sun exposure. Given the history of smoking and the chronicity of the lesion, this is a strong possibility.
   - (B) **Herpes labialis**: Usually presents as painful vesicular lesions, not typically chronic or painless.
   - (C) **Aphthous stomatitis**: Generally presents as painful ulcers and is not typically found on the lip.
   - (D) **Actinic keratosis**: Usually presents as scaly lesions and could progress to SCC but does not typically present as an ulcer.

4. **Conclusion**: Given the characteristics of the lesion (painless, chronic, location on the lip, and risk factors), the most likely diagnosis is **(A) Squamous cell carcinoma**.

Final Answer: (A) Squamous cell carcinoma
Path 6: Let's analyze the information step by step.

1. **Patient Profile**: The patient is a 58-year-old white man with a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He has been a smoker for 20 years and has worked outdoors as a fruit picker for 25 years, which suggests potential sun exposure.

2. **Symptoms**: He presents with a painless lesion on his lower lip that has been present for 3 months. The lesion is described as an ulcer near the vermillion border.

3. **Differential Diagnosis**:
   - **Traumatic Ulcer (E)**: This would usually be painful and associated with recent trauma, which is not indicated here.
   - **Squamous Cell Carcinoma (A)**: Given the patient’s demographics, smoking history, and the chronic nature (3 months) of the painless ulcer, this is a strong possibility, especially in the context of sun exposure.
   - **Herpes Labialis (B)**: This typically presents as painful vesicles and is more likely to recur. The chronicity and painless nature make this less likely.
   - **Aphthous Stomatitis (C)**: These are painful ulcers often found on non-keratinized mucosa and do not typically occur on the lip’s vermillion border.
   - **Actinic Keratosis (D)**: This would present as a scaly lesion rather than a painful ulcer, and while it can lead to squamous cell carcinoma, it is not the diagnosis here.

Given the combination of his age, smoking history, and the characteristics of the lesion, the most likely diagnosis is **Squamous Cell Carcinoma**.

**Answer: (A) Squamous cell carcinoma**
Path 7: Let's analyze the details provided in the question step by step.

1. **Patient Profile**: The patient is a 58-year-old man with significant risk factors including long-term smoking and a history of working outdoors, which increases his risk for skin-related conditions due to sun exposure.

2. **Lesion Description**: The lesion is a painless ulcer located on the lower lip near the vermillion border. The fact that it is painless and has persisted for 3 months raises concerns about a more serious condition rather than a benign one.

3. **Differential Diagnosis**:
   - **Traumatic ulcer (E)**: Typically would be painful and associated with a history of trauma.
   - **Herpes labialis (B)**: Usually presents with painful vesicular lesions, not a solitary painless ulcer.
   - **Aphthous stomatitis (C)**: Typically presents as painful ulcers, usually not on the vermillion border, and is recurrent.
   - **Actinic keratosis (D)**: Can present as a rough, scaly patch that may evolve into a squamous cell carcinoma but generally does not present as a solitary ulcer.
   - **Squamous cell carcinoma (A)**: Often presents as a persistent, non-healing ulcer or sore, especially in someone with significant risk factors like smoking and sun exposure.

Given the patient's age, risk factors (smoking and outdoor work), and the characteristics of the lesion (painless, persistent ulcer), the most likely diagnosis is:

**Answer: (A) Squamous cell carcinoma**
Path 8: Let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. **Patient Profile**: The patient is a 58-year-old man with a significant smoking history (one pack daily for 20 years) and a history of working as a fruit picker, which may suggest prolonged sun exposure.

2. **Symptom Details**: He presents with a painless lesion on the lower lip that has been present for 3 months, located near the vermillion border. The characteristics of the lesion (painless and persistent) are important.

3. **Risk Factors**: The patient's smoking history and potential sun exposure increase the risk for oral cancers, particularly squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).

4. **Examination Findings**: The lesion is described as a single ulcer, which raises concern for a malignancy given the chronicity and characteristics. 

Now, let's evaluate the answer options:

- **(E) Traumatic ulcer**: These are usually painful and associated with a history of trauma. This does not fit the description of being painless and chronic.

- **(A) Squamous cell carcinoma**: This fits the profile well. It can present as a non-healing ulcer or lesion on the lip, especially in smokers and those with sun exposure.

- **(B) Herpes labialis**: Typically presents as painful vesicles that crust over, not as a chronic painless ulcer.

- **(C) Aphthous stomatitis**: Usually presents with painful ulcers and is not typically found on the lip.

- **(D) Actinic keratosis**: While it can occur on the lip and is related to sun exposure, it typically presents as a scaly patch rather than an ulcer.

Considering all of the above, the most likely diagnosis for this patient's chronic, painless ulcer near the vermillion border, especially given his risk factors, is:

**Answer: (A) Squamous cell carcinoma.**
Path 9: Let's analyze the information step by step:

1. **Patient Profile**: The patient is a 58-year-old white man with risk factors including hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, a long history of smoking, and a job that exposes him to the sun (fruit picker).

2. **Lesion Description**: The lesion is described as a painless ulcer on the lower lip, near the vermillion border. 

3. **Risk Factors for Malignancy**: Given the patient's age, smoking history, and sun exposure from his occupation, he is at increased risk for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), particularly on sun-exposed areas like the lips.

4. **Differential Diagnosis**:
   - **Traumatic Ulcer (E)**: Typically painful and associated with a history of trauma; less likely given the lack of pain.
   - **Squamous Cell Carcinoma (A)**: Painless ulcer on the lip, fits the profile of a potential malignancy.
   - **Herpes Labialis (B)**: Usually presents with vesicles and is painful; less likely as it often recurs.
   - **Aphthous Stomatitis (C)**: Causes painful ulcers, usually not on the vermillion border, and more common in younger individuals.
   - **Actinic Keratosis (D)**: Precursor to SCC, may present as a scaly lesion but not typically as a classic ulcer.

Based on these considerations, the most likely diagnosis is **(A) Squamous cell carcinoma** due to the characteristics of the lesion, the patient's risk factors, and the presentation as a painless ulcer on the lip. 

**Final Answer**: (A) Squamous cell carcinoma.
Path 10: Let's think through the information given:

1. **Patient Profile**: The patient is a 58-year-old man with a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes. He has a significant smoking history and works as a fruit picker, suggesting possible sun exposure.

2. **Symptoms**: The patient presents with a 3-month history of a painless lesion on his lower lip. The lesion is described as a single ulcer near the vermillion border, which is important for diagnosis.

3. **Considerations**:
   - **Traumatic ulcer (E)**: Usually associated with a history of trauma or irritation, which is not indicated here.
   - **Squamous cell carcinoma (A)**: Painless ulceration on the lip, especially with a history of smoking and sun exposure, raises suspicion for malignancy.
   - **Herpes labialis (B)**: Typically presents with painful vesicles and recurrent outbreaks, which does not match the description of a single painless ulcer.
   - **Aphthous stomatitis (C)**: Usually presents with painful ulcers and is not associated with the vermillion border.
   - **Actinic keratosis (D)**: This is a precancerous condition due to sun exposure, but it typically presents as a rough, scaly patch rather than an ulcer.

Given the patient's age, risk factors (smoking, sun exposure), and the nature of the lesion (painless ulcer), the most likely diagnosis is:

**Answer: (A) Squamous cell carcinoma**

Question: A 67-year-old man presents to his family physician’s office for a routine visit and to discuss a growth on his toenail that has been gradually enlarging for a month. He has a history of diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension and is on metformin, atorvastatin, and lisinopril. He admits to smoking 2 packs of cigarettes daily for the past 45 years. His blood pressure reading today is 132/88 mm Hg, heart rate is 78/min, respiration rate is 12/min and his temperature is 37.1°C (98.8°F). On exam, the patient appears alert and in no apparent distress. Capillary refill is 3 seconds. Diminished dull and sharp sensations are present bilaterally in the lower extremities distal to the mid-tibial region. An image of the patient’s toenail is provided. A potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation of a nail clipping sample confirms the presence of hyphae. Which of the following treatment options will be most effective for this condition? (B) Betamethasone + vitamin D analog (E) Griseofulvin (D) Fluconazole (C) Cephalexin (A) Terbinafine
Reason: Terbinafine is the most effective treatment for onychomycosis, which is a fungal infection of the toenail characterized by the presence of hyphae, as seen in this patient’s KOH preparation. Terbinafine works by inhibiting ergosterol synthesis in fungi, leading to the disruption of cell membrane integrity and ultimately the death of the fungus, making it particularly effective against dermatophytes commonly responsible for nail infections.
Answer: (A) Terbinafine

Question: A 2-year-old boy is brought to the pediatrician for recurrent nosebleeds. The boy was adopted two months ago and the parents have no record of his medical or family history. They report that the child has had frequent prolonged nosebleeds several times per week. Despite them applying pressure on the distal aspect of the nares and keeping his head elevated, the bleeding generally continues for hours. On exam, the boy appears pale and lethargic. A blood sample is obtained but the child bleeds through multiple pieces of gauze. No agglutination is observed when ristocetin is added to the patient’s blood. The addition of normal plasma to the sample still does not lead to agglutination. This patient has a condition that is most consistent with which of the following modes of transmission? (B) Autosomal recessive (C) Mitochondrial (A) Autosomal dominant (E) X-linked recessive (D) X-linked dominant
Reason: The symptoms described suggest a potential bleeding disorder, and the lack of agglutination with ristocetin, combined with the additional normal plasma, points towards a problem such as von Willebrand disease, which can be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Since the child was adopted and the family history is unknown, the recurrent nosebleeds and the indication of a bleeding disorder suggest that it is likely inherited rather than acquired, supporting the autosomal recessive mode of inheritance.
Answer: (B) Autosomal recessive

Question: A 23-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department by her boyfriend 10 minutes after ingesting at least 15 acetaminophen tablets. She has been admitted to the hospital several times in the past few months after attempted self-harm. She claims that her boyfriend is “extremely selfish” and “does not care for her.” She says she feels lonely and wants her boyfriend to pay attention to her. Her boyfriend says that they have broken up 10 times in the past year because she is prone to outbursts of physical aggression as well as mood swings. He says that these mood swings last a few hours and can vary from states of “exuberance and affection” to states of “depression.” On examination, the patient appears well-dressed and calm. She has normal speech, thought processes, and thought content. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? (B) Cyclothymic disorder (E) Dependent personality disorder (D) Borderline personality disorder (C) Bipolar II disorder (A) Narcissistic personality disorder
Reason: The presentation of mood swings that fluctuate between states of “exuberance and affection” and “depression,” along with the history of self-harm and difficulties in interpersonal relationships, is characteristic of Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). The instability in interpersonal relationships, self-image, and affect, along with impulsive behaviors, aligns closely with the symptoms described, making BPD the most likely diagnosis in this case.
Answer: (D) Borderline personality disorder

Question: A 71-year-old man with colon cancer presents to his oncologist because he has been experiencing photosensitivity with his current chemotherapeutic regimen. During the conversation, they decide that his symptoms are most likely a side effect of the 5-fluorouracil he is currently taking and decide to replace it with another agent. The patient is curious why some organs appear to be especially resistant to chemotherapy whereas others are particularly susceptible to chemotherapy. Which of the following cell types would be most resistant to chemotherapeutic agents? (D) Hematopoietic cells (E) Liver hepatocytes (B) Enterocytes (A) Cardiac myocytes (C) Hair follicle cells
Reason: Cardiac myocytes are generally considered to be the most resistant to chemotherapeutic agents due to their low rate of cell division and unique metabolic environment. Unlike rapidly dividing cells, such as hematopoietic cells or enterocytes, cardiac myocytes have a very limited ability to regenerate, making them less affected by drugs that target actively dividing cells.
Answer: (A) Cardiac myocytes

Question: A 16-year-old girl comes to the physician because of episodic lower abdominal pain for 5 months. The pain starts to occur a few hours before her menses and lasts for 2–3 days. Ibuprofen helped reduce the pain in the first months but has no effect now. She has missed a couple of days at school because of severe pain. Menarche was at the age of 14 years, and menses occur at regular 29-day intervals. She is sexually active with one male partner and uses condoms inconsistently. Her temperature is 37.1°C (98.8°F), pulse is 88/min, and blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg. Physical and pelvic examination show no abnormalities. A urine pregnancy test is negative. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? (B) Ceftriaxone and doxycycline therapy (D) Oral contraceptive pill (A) Diagnostic laparoscopy (E) Urinalysis (C) Pelvic ultrasonography
Reason: The oral contraceptive pill is the most appropriate next step in management for this patient, as she presents with symptoms consistent with primary dysmenorrhea, characterized by pain that occurs just before menstruation and is alleviated by anti-inflammatory medications. Since her pain has become more severe and ibuprofen is no longer effective, hormonal treatments such as oral contraceptives can help regulate her menstrual cycle and reduce the severity of dysmenorrhea.
Answer: (D) Oral contraceptive pill

Question: A 55-year-old man presents to the emergency department because of an excruciating headache that started suddenly after he got home from work. He also reports having double vision. Specifically, in the last week he almost got into two car accidents with vehicles that "came out of nowhere" while he was trying to merge on the highway. Physical examination is notable for ptosis of the left eye, which is also inferiorly and laterally deviated. The patient is treated emergently and then started on a hormone replacement in order to avoid life-threatening post-treatment complications. The patient's current presentation was associated with a pathologic process that existed for several months prior to this event. Which of the following symptoms could this patient have experienced as part of that pre-existing pathology? (D) Increased hat size (B) Hypoglycemia (C) Hyperkalemia (A) Gastric ulcers (E) Kidney stones
Reason: The increased hat size is indicative of acromegaly, which can be caused by a growth hormone-secreting pituitary tumor. Given the patient's age, sudden onset of severe headache, double vision, and ocular muscle involvement suggesting possible pituitary involvement, this symptom likely reflects the gradual enlargement of soft tissues and skull associated with a chronic pathological process, such as a tumor.
Answer: (D) Increased hat size

Question: A one-week-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his mother, who recently immigrated to the United States and does not have health insurance. He was born at home, and has not received any medical care since birth. The mother states the boy has become irritable and has been feeding poorly. In the last day, she said he seems "stiff" and is having apparent muscle spasms. On your exam, you note the findings in figure A. Which of the following interventions might have prevented this disease? (A) Conjugated polysaccharide vaccine given to infant at birth (E) Genetic counseling (D) Improved maternal nutrition (B) Toxoid vaccine given to mother pre-natally (C) Vitamin injection given to newborn at birth
Reason: The answer is (B) Toxoid vaccine given to mother pre-natally. This intervention could have prevented neonatal tetanus, which is likely what the one-week-old boy is suffering from, as it can occur in infants born to unimmunized mothers. Maternal vaccination during pregnancy provides passive immunity to the newborn, protecting them from infections such as tetanus.
Answer: (B) Toxoid vaccine given to mother pre-natally

Question: A scientist is designing experiments to better appreciate how the lung expands. He acquires two sets of cat lungs and fills one set with saline. He plots changes in the lungs' volume with respect to pressure as shown in Image A. The pressure-volume loop of the liquid-ventilated lung is different from the gas-ventilated lung because of what property? (B) Increased residual volume (C) More pronounced hysteresis (E) Increased inspiratory pressure (D) Increased compliance (A) Reduced airway resistance
Reason: The answer is (D) Increased compliance. Compliance refers to the ability of the lung to expand with a given change in pressure; liquid-filled lungs typically demonstrate higher compliance than gas-filled lungs due to the absence of surface tension, which allows them to stretch more easily under pressure. This characteristic leads to a distinct pressure-volume relationship when comparing liquid-ventilated lungs to those ventilated with gas.
Answer: (D) Increased compliance

Question: A previously healthy 5-year-old girl is brought to the emergency department by her parents because of a severe headache, nausea, and vomiting for 6 hours. Last week she had fever, myalgias, and a sore throat for several days that resolved with over-the-counter medication. She is oriented only to person. Examination shows bilateral optic disc swelling. Serum studies show:
Glucose 61 mg/dL
Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 198 U/L
Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 166 U/L
Prothrombin time 18 sec
Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?" (D) Ruptured berry aneurysm (A) Autoimmune destruction of beta cells (E) Ethylene glycol poisoning (C) Hepatic mitochondrial injury (B) Acute viral hepatitis
Reason: The answer is (C) Hepatic mitochondrial injury. The combination of elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT), symptoms of severe headache, nausea, and vomiting, along with the history of prior fever and myalgias suggests a significant underlying condition. Hepatic mitochondrial injury can occur in various conditions, such as viral infections, and can lead to metabolic disturbances that may present as neurological symptoms, potentially explaining the girl’s altered mental status as well as her hepatic symptoms.
Answer: (C) Hepatic mitochondrial injury

Question: A 1-year-old boy is brought to the physician for the evaluation of swelling around the eyelids. He was born at term after an uncomplicated pregnancy. He is at the 95th percentile for weight and 60th percentile for length. His blood pressure is 130/86 mm Hg. Physical examination shows an empty scrotal sac and a left-sided abdominal mass. Ophthalmologic examination shows no abnormalities. Urinalysis shows a proteinuria of 3+ and fatty casts. Abdominal ultrasound shows a hypervascular mass at the upper pole of the kidney. Which of the following best describes the pathogenesis of this patient's disease? (D) Deletion of the WT1 gene on chromosome 11 (C) Increased expression of insulin-like growth factor 2 (B) Deficiency of 17α-hydroxylase (A) Inhibition of hypoxia-inducible factor 1a (E) Loss of function of zinc finger transcription factor
Reason: The best choice for the pathogenesis of this patient's disease is (E) Loss of function of zinc finger transcription factor. This is because the clinical presentation, including the presence of a left-sided abdominal mass and the associated symptoms, suggests a potential Wilms' tumor or nephroblastoma, which is related to mutations affecting the WT1 gene—known to be a zinc finger transcription factor—on chromosome 11. Loss of function in this gene can lead to developmental abnormalities associated with kidney formation and tumors.
Answer: (E) Loss of function of zinc finger transcription factor

Question: A 31-year-old woman comes to the physician because of intermittent episodes of stabbing right lower jaw pain for 6 weeks. The pain is severe, sharp, and lasts for a few seconds. These episodes commonly occur when she washes her face, brushes her teeth, or eats a meal. She does not have visual disturbances, weakness of her facial muscles, or hearing loss. Five weeks ago, she had an episode of acute bacterial sinusitis, which was treated with antibiotics. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial treatment for this patient's condition? (D) Valacyclovir (E) Doxepin (B) Amoxicillin (A) Microvascular decompression (C) Carbamazepine
Reason: The most appropriate initial treatment for this patient's condition is (C) Carbamazepine. This patient is likely experiencing trigeminal neuralgia, characterized by sharp, stabbing pain in the distribution of the trigeminal nerve, often triggered by activities such as washing her face or eating. Carbamazepine is the first-line medication used to manage trigeminal neuralgia as it stabilizes neuronal membranes and reduces the frequency and severity of pain episodes.
Answer: (C) Carbamazepine

Question: A 22-year-old soldier sustains a stab wound to his chest during a military attack in Mali. He is brought to the combat medic by his unit for a primary survey. The soldier reports shortness of breath. He is alert and oriented to time, place, and person. His pulse is 99/min, respirations are 32/min, and blood pressure is 112/72 mm Hg. Examination shows a 2-cm wound at the left fourth intercostal space at the midclavicular line. Bubbling of blood is seen with each respiration at the wound site. There is no jugular venous distention. There is hyperresonance to percussion and decreased breath sounds on the left side. The trachea is at the midline. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? (C) Emergency echocardiography (B) Emergency pericardiocentesis (A) Partially occlusive dressing (D) Needle thoracostomy (E) Supplemental oxygen
"
Reason: The most appropriate next step in management for this patient is (A) Partially occlusive dressing. The presence of bubbling blood from the wound suggests an open pneumothorax, also known as a "sucking chest wound," which necessitates coverage to prevent air from entering the pleural space during inhalation. A partially occlusive dressing allows air to escape but prevents further air from entering during inhalation, thereby improving respiratory function while preparations for definitive care are made.
Answer: (A) Partially occlusive dressing

Question: A 45-year-old woman presents to the office complaining of bilateral joint pain and stiffness in her hand joints for the past 3 months. She reports increasing difficulty holding a coffee cup or pen due to stiffness, especially in the morning. Over-the-counter ibuprofen partially relieves her symptoms. Past medical history is significant for dysthymia and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Vital signs are normal except for a low-grade fever. On examination, there is mild swelling and tenderness in the proximal interphalangeal and metacarpophalangeal joints and wrists. Nontender and non-pruritic nodules near the elbows are noted. Chest and abdominal examination are normal. X-rays of the hands reveal soft tissue swelling, joint space narrowing, and bony erosions. Her hematocrit is 32%, and her erythrocyte sedimentation rate is 40 mm/hr. This patient is at greatest risk for which of the following? (D) Obstructive pulmonary disease (E) Osteitis deformans (C) Sacroiliac joint inflammation (A) Disease progression to distal interphalangeal joints (B) Osteoporosis
Reason: The answer is (B) Osteoporosis. This patient likely has rheumatoid arthritis (RA), which is known to increase the risk of osteoporosis due to chronic inflammation and the effects of corticosteroid treatment that is commonly used to manage RA symptoms. The presence of joint erosions and systemic symptoms also indicates a higher risk of developing osteoporosis as the disease progresses.
Answer: (B) Osteoporosis

Question: A 13-year-old girl presents with a 4-week history of unrelenting cough, night sweats, and fever. No known past medical history and no current medications. The patient recently immigrated to the country from a rural town in northern India. Vaccination status is unknown. Her temperature is 38.5°C (101.3°F), pulse is 115/min, blood pressure is 95/65 mm Hg, and respiratory rate is 22/min. Physical examination is significant for decreased breath sounds in the right upper lobe and multiple right cervical lymphadenopathies. A chest radiograph reveals multiple cavitations in the right upper lobe and right hilar lymphadenopathy. A sputum culture shows acid-fast bacilli. Which of the following compounds must be included in addition to the recommended antimicrobial therapy in this patient? (A) Thiamine (B) Riboflavin (C) Pyridoxine (E) Folic acid (D) Niacin
Reason: The answer is (C) Pyridoxine. In the treatment of tuberculosis, particularly when using isoniazid, pyridoxine (vitamin B6) is often added to prevent isoniazid-induced peripheral neuropathy. Isoniazid can interfere with the metabolism of pyridoxine, leading to deficiencies and associated neurological symptoms, hence its inclusion is important for patient safety and comfort during therapy.
Answer: (C) Pyridoxine

Question: A 32-year-old G1P0 woman undergoes her 2nd-trimester ultrasound in a community hospital. During her prenatal care, she was found to have mild anemia, low levels of folate, and serum alpha-fetoprotein levels greater than 2 multiples of the median (MoM) on 2 separate occasions. Her 1st-trimester ultrasound was significant for the absence of the intracranial lucency, no visualization of the cisterna magna, and posterior shift of the brain stem. These 2nd-trimester ultrasound reports reveal the widening of the lumbosacral spine ossification centers and the presence of a sac in proximity to the lumbosacral defect. Which of the following statements best describes the congenital defect in the fetus? (E) Failure of mesenchymal cells to form a neural rod (A) Abnormal development of the caudal eminence (C) Failure of the rostral neuropore to close (B) Persistence of the anterior accessory neurenteric canal (ANC) (D) Failure of the caudal neuropore to close
Reason: The congenital defect described in the fetus is best characterized by the "failure of the caudal neuropore to close," which is associated with neural tube defects like spina bifida that result in the development of a lumbosacral defect. The presence of a sac near the lumbosacral region and the widening of the lumbosacral spine ossification centers further supports this diagnosis, as these findings align with typical manifestations of the condition resulting from improper closure of the caudal neuropore.
Answer: (D) Failure of the caudal neuropore to close

Question: A 34-year-old woman presents with recurrent panic attacks that have been worsening over the past 5 weeks. She also says she has been seeing things that are not present in reality and is significantly bothered by a short attention span which has badly affected her job in the past 6 months. No significant past medical history. No current medications. The patient is afebrile and vital signs are within normal limits. Her BMI is 34 kg/m2. Physical examination is unremarkable. The patient has prescribed antipsychotic medication. She expresses concerns about any effects of the new medication on her weight. Which of the following medications would be the best course of treatment in this patient? (B) Olanzapine (C) Clozapine (A) Ziprasidone (D) Clonazepam (E) Chlorpromazine
Reason: The best course of treatment in this patient is (A) Ziprasidone, as it is an atypical antipsychotic that has a lower risk of weight gain compared to other medications such as Olanzapine or Clozapine. Given the patient's concerns about weight management and her high BMI, Ziprasidone is a favorable choice that also addresses her symptoms of panic attacks and psychotic experiences without significantly affecting her weight.
Answer: (A) Ziprasidone

Question: A 36-year-old woman comes to the physician for evaluation of unintentional weight gain of 5.5 kg (12.2 lb) and irregular menstrual cycles over the past 2 months. She does not take any medications. Her blood pressure is 155/85 mm Hg. Physical examination shows central obesity, hyperpigmentation of the palmar creases, and violaceous scarring of the abdomen. Early morning serum cortisol levels are elevated and serum adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) is within the reference range after a low-dose dexamethasone suppression test. A high-dose dexamethasone suppression test shows suppression of ACTH. Further evaluation is most likely to show which of the following findings? (A) Atrophy of the pituitary gland (E) Unilateral carcinoma of the adrenal cortex (C) Nodular hypertrophy of the zona reticularis (D) Bilateral hyperplasia of the zona fasciculata (B) Benign adenoma of the adrenal medulla
Reason: The answer is (D) Bilateral hyperplasia of the zona fasciculata because the presentation suggests Cushing's syndrome due to an adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-dependent cause, likely secondary to a pituitary adenoma (Cushing's disease). The high-dose dexamethasone suppression test indicates that the cortisol production is due to an adrenal source, leading to bilateral hyperplasia of the zona fasciculata due to the stimulation from ACTH.
Answer: (D) Bilateral hyperplasia of the zona fasciculata

Question: A 24-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department after being assaulted. The paramedics report that the patient was found conscious and reported being kicked many times in the torso. She is alert and able to respond to questions. She denies any head trauma. She has a past medical history of endometriosis and a tubo-ovarian abscess that was removed surgically two years ago. Her only home medication is oral contraceptive pills. Her temperature is 98.5°F (36.9°C), blood pressure is 82/51 mmHg, pulse is 136/min, respirations are 10/min, and SpO2 is 94%. She has superficial lacerations to the face and severe bruising over her chest and abdomen. Her lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally and her abdomen is soft, distended, and diffusely tender to palpation. Her skin is cool and clammy. Her FAST exam reveals fluid in the perisplenic space.

Which of the following is the next best step in management? (A) Abdominal radiograph (E) Diagnostic peritoneal lavage (D) Fluid resuscitation (B) Abdominal CT (C) Emergency laparotomy
Reason: The answer is (D) Fluid resuscitation because the patient exhibits signs of hypovolemic shock, indicated by low blood pressure (82/51 mmHg), tachycardia (pulse of 136/min), and cool, clammy skin. In an unstable trauma patient, especially with suspected internal bleeding (as suggested by the presence of fluid in the perisplenic space), immediate fluid resuscitation is critical to stabilize the patient's hemodynamics before further imaging or surgical intervention is performed.
Answer: (D) Fluid resuscitation

Question: A 3-day-old girl is brought to the physician by her mother because of difficulty feeding and lethargy for 1 day. She had jaundice after birth and was scheduled for a follow-up visit the next day. Her hemoglobin is 18.5 g/dL, total bilirubin is 38.1 mg/dL, and direct bilirubin is 0.1 mg/dL. Despite appropriate measures, the infant dies. At autopsy, examination of the brain shows deep yellow staining of the basal ganglia and subthalamic nuclei bilaterally. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this infant's findings? (D) Impaired glucuronidation of bilirubin (E) Decreased bilirubin uptake in hepatocytes (A) Defective intracellular bilirubin transport (B) Increased degradation of red blood cells (C) Extrahepatic obliteration of the biliary tree
Reason: The answer is (D) Impaired glucuronidation of bilirubin because the infant presented with severe hyperbilirubinemia (total bilirubin of 38.1 mg/dL) and had indirect (unconjugated) hyperbilirubinemia suggested by the low direct bilirubin level. This condition is indicative of a failure to properly conjugate bilirubin in the liver, which leads to bilirubin accumulation and can result in kernicterus, as evidenced by the deep yellow staining in the brain's basal ganglia and subthalamic nuclei upon autopsy.
Answer: (D) Impaired glucuronidation of bilirubin

Question: A 74-year-old male presents to his primary care physician complaining of left lower back pain. He reports a four-month history of worsening left flank pain. More recently, he has started to notice that his urine appears brown. His past medical history is notable for gout, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and myocardial infarction status-post stent placement. He has a 45 pack-year smoking history and drinks 2-3 alcoholic beverages per day. His temperature is 100.9°F (38.3°C), blood pressure is 145/80 mmHg, pulse is 105/min, and respirations are 20/min. Physical examination is notable for left costovertebral angle tenderness. A CT of this patient’s abdomen is shown in figure A. This lesion most likely arose from which of the following cells? (A) Proximal tubule cells (B) Distal convoluted tubule cells (E) Collecting duct epithelial cells (D) Perirenal adipocytes (C) Mesangial cells
Reason: The correct answer is (A) Proximal tubule cells. 

This conclusion is supported by the fact that renal lesions, particularly those indicative of renal cell carcinoma, often arise from the proximal tubule cells, which are the most common site for such tumors. Additionally, the presentation of left flank pain, hematuria (brown urine), and costovertebral angle tenderness are suggestive of a renal pathology, likely involving the proximal regions of the nephron where these tumors typically originate.
Answer: (A) Proximal tubule cells

Question: A physician at an internal medicine ward notices that several of his patients have hyponatremia without any associated symptoms. Severe hyponatremia, often defined as < 120 mEq/L, is associated with altered mental status, coma, and seizures, and warrants treatment with hypertonic saline. Because some patients are chronically hyponatremic, with serum levels < 120 mEq/L, but remain asymptomatic, the physician is considering decreasing the cutoff for severe hyponatremia to < 115 mEq/L. Changing the cutoff to < 115 mEq/L would affect the validity of serum sodium in predicting severe hyponatremia requiring hypertonic saline in which of the following ways? (C) Increased sensitivity and decreased positive predictive value (A) Increased specificity and decreased negative predictive value (B) Decreased specificity and increased negative predictive value (E) Increased specificity and decreased positive predictive value (D) Decreased sensitivity and decreased positive predictive value
Reason: The correct answer is (A) Increased specificity and decreased negative predictive value. 

This conclusion is based on the fact that lowering the cutoff for severe hyponatremia to < 115 mEq/L will likely result in a higher proportion of patients being classified as having severe hyponatremia only when they actually do, thus increasing specificity. However, this narrower definition could lead to a decrease in the negative predictive value, as the probability of correctly identifying patients who do not require hypertonic saline treatment might be reduced; more patients could be incorrectly classified as severe cases, resulting in a loss of accurate predictions for those who remain asymptomatic.
Answer: (A) Increased specificity and decreased negative predictive value

Question: A 35-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of headache, palpitations, diarrhea, and weight loss. She takes no medications. Her pulse is 110/min and blood pressure is 125/70 mm Hg. Examination shows warm, moist skin and diffuse hyperreflexia. An MRI of the brain shows a sellar mass. The underlying cause of this patient's condition is best explained by binding of a ligand to which of the following? (D) Membrane-bound guanylate cyclase (A) Intracytosolic nuclear receptor (B) Receptor tyrosine kinase (C) G protein-coupled receptors (E) Nonreceptor tyrosine kinase
Reason: The correct answer is (C) G protein-coupled receptors. 

This conclusion is supported by the patient's presentation, which suggests hypersecretion of hormones likely linked to the thyroid or adrenal glands; G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are pivotal in mediating hormone signaling pathways. Since the symptoms of headache, palpitations, and hyperreflexia could indicate an endocrine disorder, such as hyperthyroidism or a catecholamine-secreting tumor, the involvement of GPCRs in the action of many hormones (like thyroid hormones or catecholamines) provides a strong rationale for this answer. Additionally, the presence of a sellar mass raises suspicion for a pituitary adenoma that may affect hormone signaling through GPCR pathways.
Answer: (C) G protein-coupled receptors

[INFO] Opinion paths:
Path 1: Let's analyze the information step by step.

The patient presents with severe muscle and joint pain, joint stiffness in the morning, fatigue, and tingling sensations in the lower limbs. The examination shows symmetric muscular tenderness but normal strength and reflexes. Laboratory tests indicate normal blood counts, normal thyroid function, and a normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), which suggests that there is no significant inflammatory process occurring.

These symptoms, particularly the combination of muscle pain, joint stiffness, fatigue, and tingling sensations, could be suggestive of fibromyalgia. Fibromyalgia is characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain accompanied by fatigue, sleep disturbances, and often associated with anxiety and mood disorders.

The treatment options listed include medications for pain relief and symptom management. In fibromyalgia, common treatment options include:

- **Amitriptyline**: This is a tricyclic antidepressant that is often used to treat fibromyalgia due to its analgesic properties and ability to improve sleep.

Given the context of the case and the likely diagnosis of fibromyalgia, the most appropriate therapy from the options provided is:

**Answer: (D) Amitriptyline**.
Path 2: Let's analyze the symptoms and details provided about the patient:

1. **Symptoms**: The patient has severe muscle and joint pain, joint stiffness in the morning, fatigue, and a tingling sensation in her lower limbs. These symptoms can be indicative of several conditions, including fibromyalgia or perhaps another inflammatory or autoimmune disorder.

2. **Examination Findings**: The examination shows symmetric muscular tenderness but normal strength and deep tendon reflexes. This aligns with fibromyalgia, which is characterized by widespread pain and tenderness.

3. **Laboratory Studies**: The lab results show normal hemoglobin, leukocyte count, platelet count, MCV, ESR, and thyroid function tests. This suggests that there is no significant inflammation or other hematological disorders, which further points toward a diagnosis like fibromyalgia rather than a rheumatological condition.

4. **Therapies Considered**: 
   - **Amitriptyline** (D) is often used to manage fibromyalgia as it can help with pain and improve sleep.
   - **Methotrexate** (E) is typically used for inflammatory conditions like rheumatoid arthritis.
   - **Vitamin B12** (C) would be appropriate if there were signs of deficiency but isn't indicated here.
   - **Bupropion** (A) is an antidepressant but not first-line for fibromyalgia.
   - **Temazepam** (B) is a sedative and may help with sleep but does not address pain management.

Given the patient's presentation, fibromyalgia is a likely diagnosis, and since amitriptyline is commonly used to manage fibromyalgia symptoms, the most appropriate therapy for this patient would be:

**Answer: (D) Amitriptyline**
Path 3: To analyze this case step by step, we need to consider the symptoms and laboratory findings of the 46-year-old woman:

1. **Symptoms**: She presents with severe muscle and joint pain, morning stiffness, fatigue, a tingling sensation in the lower limbs, and a feeling of bloating. These symptoms may suggest a chronic pain condition or a rheumatological disorder.

2. **Examination Findings**: The examination reveals symmetric muscular tenderness, which is significant, and normal strength and deep tendon reflexes.

3. **Laboratory Findings**: 
   - Hemoglobin, leukocyte count, and platelet count are within normal ranges.
   - Mean corpuscular volume is normal, suggesting no macrocytic anemia.
   - Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is low, indicating no significant inflammation.
   - Other metabolic panels (glucose, creatinine, TSH) are unremarkable.

4. **Assessment**: The combination of chronic pain, morning stiffness, and a tingling sensation suggests a possible diagnosis of fibromyalgia or another pain syndrome. The normal laboratory findings and low ESR indicate that it is unlikely to be an inflammatory or infectious process.

5. **Therapeutic Options**:
   - **Methotrexate (E)** is usually used for inflammatory conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, which does not fit here due to the normal ESR and lack of inflammatory signs.
   - **Amitriptyline (D)** is often used as a first-line treatment for fibromyalgia. It can help manage chronic pain and improve sleep.
   - **Vitamin B12 (C)** would be appropriate if there were signs of deficiency, but that does not align with her current symptoms.
   - **Bupropion (A)** is an antidepressant, not typically first-line for the pain and fatigue described.
   - **Temazepam (B)** is a sedative used for insomnia but does not address the chronic pain.

Based on the analysis, the most appropriate therapy for this patient, considering her symptoms and the likely diagnosis of fibromyalgia, would be:

**Answer: (D) Amitriptyline**.
Path 4: Let's analyze the case step by step.

The patient is a 46-year-old woman presenting with:
- Severe muscle and joint pain for 5 months
- Morning stiffness
- Fatigue
- Tingling sensation in the lower limbs
- Symmetric muscular tenderness
- Normal strength and deep tendon reflexes
- Normal laboratory results including an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 12 mm/h, which indicates no significant inflammation.

Given the symptoms of widespread muscle and joint pain, morning stiffness, and the absence of inflammatory markers, this patient appears to have fibromyalgia rather than a specific inflammatory or autoimmune disorder.

For the management of fibromyalgia, the first-line treatments commonly include medications that can help with pain relief and improve sleep. Amitriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant, is often used for its analgesic properties and its ability to improve sleep quality.

Therefore, the most appropriate therapy for this patient is:

**(D) Amitriptyline.**
Path 5: Let's think step by step about the patient's symptoms and the most appropriate therapy.

The patient is a 46-year-old woman presenting with severe muscle and joint pain, morning stiffness, fatigue, and a tingling sensation in her lower limbs. She has normal laboratory results with an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 12 mm/h, which indicates that there is no significant inflammation or active autoimmune process at this time.

Given her symptoms, particularly the muscle and joint pain along with morning stiffness, one possible diagnosis could be fibromyalgia. This condition is characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, and often associated with sleep disturbances and cognitive issues. The tingling sensation might suggest some peripheral nerve involvement, but no significant neurological deficits are noted.

The treatments for fibromyalgia often include medications that can help with pain and sleep disturbances. Among the options provided:

- (E) Methotrexate is typically used for inflammatory diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, which does not seem to be the primary issue here.
- (D) Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant that is often used to help with pain management and to improve sleep in patients with fibromyalgia.
- (C) Vitamin B12 would only be appropriate if there was a deficiency, which is not indicated here.
- (A) Bupropion is an antidepressant, but it is not typically used for fibromyalgia.
- (B) Temazepam is a sedative that could help with sleep but does not address pain.

Considering these options, the most appropriate therapy for this patient, given the suspicion of fibromyalgia and the need for a medication that can help with both pain and sleep, would be:

**Answer: (D) Amitriptyline.**
Path 6: Let's analyze the case step by step:

1. **Patient Symptoms**: The 46-year-old woman presents with severe muscle and joint pain for 5 months, morning stiffness, fatigue, and tingling sensation in her lower limbs. These symptoms can be indicative of a chronic pain condition, and her presentation is consistent with fibromyalgia.

2. **Physical Exam**: Examination shows symmetric muscular tenderness, particularly in common fibromyalgia tender points, which further supports this diagnosis. 

3. **Laboratory Results**: The laboratory studies reveal normal hematologic values, normal thyroid function, and a low erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), suggesting that there is no significant inflammatory process or malignancy at play.

4. **Common Treatments for Fibromyalgia**: Treatment for fibromyalgia often includes medications that can help with pain relief and improve sleep, as well as addressing associated symptoms like fatigue.

5. **Options Analysis**:
   - **(E) Methotrexate**: Typically used for inflammatory conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, not first-line for fibromyalgia.
   - **(D) Amitriptyline**: A tricyclic antidepressant that is often effective for chronic pain syndromes and is commonly used to help with fibromyalgia symptoms, including pain and sleep disturbances.
   - **(C) Vitamin B12**: Not indicated based on her symptoms and lab results.
   - **(A) Bupropion**: An antidepressant that is not typically used for fibromyalgia.
   - **(B) Temazepam**: A sedative that may help with sleep but does not address the pain component.

Considering the above points, the most appropriate therapy for this patient, given her symptoms and the likely diagnosis of fibromyalgia, is:

**Answer: (D) Amitriptyline**.
Path 7: Let's analyze the case step by step.

The patient is a 46-year-old woman presenting with:

- Severe muscle and joint pain for 5 months
- Morning joint stiffness
- Fatigue
- Tingling sensation in her lower limbs
- Normal laboratory results, including a normal ESR, suggesting no significant inflammation.

Given these symptoms, particularly the widespread muscle and joint pain along with stiffness, the patient may be experiencing fibromyalgia. The normal laboratory tests and lack of significant inflammatory markers support this diagnosis, as fibromyalgia is a condition characterized by chronic pain, fatigue, and tenderness without obvious inflammation or damage to tissues.

Among the options provided, the most appropriate therapy for fibromyalgia includes medications that help manage pain and improve sleep. Amitriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant, is often used to treat fibromyalgia due to its analgesic properties and ability to improve sleep quality.

Therefore, the most appropriate therapy for this patient is:

**Answer: (D) Amitriptyline**
Path 8: Let's analyze the case step by step.

The patient is a 46-year-old woman presenting with severe muscle and joint pain, joint stiffness, fatigue, and tingling sensations in her lower limbs. She has normal laboratory values and a normal urinalysis, which makes certain autoimmune conditions less likely. However, her symptoms and examination findings, particularly symmetric muscular tenderness and the presence of fatigue, suggest a possible diagnosis of fibromyalgia.

In managing fibromyalgia, the most appropriate therapy would typically involve medications that help alleviate pain and improve sleep. Among the options provided:

- (E) Methotrexate: This is primarily used for inflammatory conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, which does not appear to be the case here.
- (D) Amitriptyline: This is a tricyclic antidepressant that is often used to treat fibromyalgia, as it can help with pain and improve sleep quality.
- (C) Vitamin B12: While important for certain conditions, it is not specific to the symptoms presented.
- (A) Bupropion: This is an antidepressant that can help with mood and energy but is not specifically indicated for pain management in fibromyalgia.
- (B) Temazepam: This is a sedative used for insomnia but does not address the pain component of fibromyalgia.

Given the symptoms of fibromyalgia and the need for a medication that addresses pain and possibly aids in sleep, the most appropriate therapy for this patient is:

**Answer: (D) Amitriptyline**
Path 9: Let's analyze the case step by step.

The patient is a 46-year-old woman presenting with:

- Severe muscle and joint pain for 5 months
- Joint stiffness in the morning
- Fatigue
- Tingling sensation in the lower limbs
- Symmetric muscular tenderness
- Normal strength and deep tendon reflexes
- Normal laboratory findings except for a slightly elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 12 mm/h, which is within the normal range for many labs.

Given these symptoms, particularly the muscle and joint pain, morning stiffness, and fatigue, the presentation is suggestive of fibromyalgia. This condition is characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, and often sleep disturbances. The normal laboratory results and the absence of significant inflammatory markers (like a significantly elevated ESR) also support this diagnosis.

In terms of management, fibromyalgia is often treated with medications that can help with pain and improve sleep. 

Among the options given:

- (E) Methotrexate: Typically used for inflammatory conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, not first-line for fibromyalgia.
- (D) Amitriptyline: This is a tricyclic antidepressant that is commonly used to help with pain management in fibromyalgia and can also aid in sleep.
- (C) Vitamin B12: Not indicated for fibromyalgia.
- (A) Bupropion: An antidepressant, but not specifically indicated for fibromyalgia.
- (B) Temazepam: A sedative that could help with sleep but does not address pain.

Given this information, the most appropriate therapy for this patient is (D) Amitriptyline, as it is used to manage pain and improve sleep in fibromyalgia patients.

Answer: (D) Amitriptyline
Path 10: Let's analyze the symptoms and laboratory findings step by step:

1. **Symptoms**: The 46-year-old woman presents with severe muscle and joint pain, joint stiffness in the morning, fatigue, tingling sensations in her lower limbs, and a feeling of bloating. Her examination reveals symmetric muscular tenderness, but her strength and deep tendon reflexes are normal.

2. **Medical History and Medications**: She has primary hypertension and occasional migraine headaches, and she is on propranolol and sumatriptan. 

3. **Laboratory Findings**: 
   - Hemoglobin: Normal

   - Mean corpuscular volume (MCV): Normal
   - Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR): Normal
   - Serum glucose: Normal
   - Serum creatinine: Normal
   - TSH: Normal
   - Urinalysis: Normal

4. **Assessment**: The symptoms of muscle and joint pain along with morning stiffness and fatigue could suggest conditions like fibromyalgia or myofascial pain syndrome. The normal laboratory workup, including a normal ESR, indicates that there may not be an inflammatory or autoimmune process at play. The tingling sensation in her lower limbs could be indicative of a neuropathic component.

5. **Treatment Options**: 
   - (E) Methotrexate is typically used for autoimmune conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, which doesn't fit here due to normal laboratory markers.
   - (D) Amitriptyline is often used for chronic pain conditions, especially fibromyalgia, due to its analgesic and sedative effects.
   - (C) Vitamin B12 would be indicated if there were signs of deficiency, which is not evident here.

Question: Replication in eukaryotic cells is a highly organized and accurate process. The process involves a number enzymes such as primase, DNA polymerase, topoisomerase II, and DNA ligase. In which of the following directions is DNA newly synthesized? (B) 5' --> 3' (D) N terminus --> C terminus (C) 3' --> 5' & 5' --> 3' (E) C terminus --> N terminus (A) 3' --> 5'
Reason: The correct answer is (B) 5' --> 3'. During DNA synthesis, nucleotides can only be added to the growing strand in the 5' to 3' direction, as DNA polymerases can only add new nucleotides to the hydroxyl (OH) group at the 3' end of the growing DNA strand. This directionality is essential for the accurate replication of DNA.

Question: A group of researchers conducted various studies on hepatitis C incidence and prevalence. They noticed that there is a high prevalence of hepatitis C in third-world countries, where it has a significant impact on the quality of life of the infected individual. The research group made several attempts to produce a vaccine that prevents hepatitis C infection but all attempts failed. Which of the following would most likely be the reason for the failure to produce a vaccine? (A) Tolerance (D) Non-DNA genome (E) Polysaccharide envelope (B) Antigenic mimicry (C) Antigenic variation
Reason: The most likely reason for the failure to produce a vaccine for hepatitis C is (C) antigenic variation, as the virus continuously mutates and changes its surface antigens, making it difficult for the immune system to recognize and mount an effective response. This variability allows the virus to evade vaccines that target specific antigens, complicating efforts to develop an effective and long-lasting vaccine strategy.
Answer: (C) Antigenic variation

Question: A 13-year-old Caucasian male presents with his father to the pediatrician’s office complaining of left lower thigh pain. He reports slowly progressive pain over the distal aspect of his left thigh over the past three months. He denies any recent trauma to the area. His temperature is 100.9°F (38.3°C). On exam, there is swelling and tenderness overlying the inferior aspect of the left femoral diaphysis. Laboratory evaluation is notable for an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Biopsy of the lesion demonstrates sheets of monotonous small round blue cells with minimal cytoplasm. He is diagnosed and started on a medication that inhibits transcription by intercalating into DNA at the transcription initiation complex. Which of the following adverse events will this patient be at highest risk for following initiation of this medication? (B) Gingival hyperplasia (D) Hemorrhagic cystitis (E) Bone marrow suppression (C) Peripheral neuropathy (A) Pulmonary fibrosis
Reason: The patient is at highest risk for (E) bone marrow suppression following the initiation of the medication that inhibits transcription by intercalating into DNA, which is indicative of a cytotoxic agent like an anthracycline or other similar chemotherapy agents. These medications can lead to myelosuppression by affecting rapidly dividing cells in the bone marrow, resulting in decreased production of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets, which is particularly concerning in a pediatric patient undergoing treatment for cancer.
Answer: (E) Bone marrow suppression

Question: A 22-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with a 3-day history of fever and abdominal pain. She says that the pain is located in the left lower quadrant of the abdomen and feels crampy in nature. The pain has been associated with bloody diarrhea and joint tenderness. She has no past medical history but says that she returned 2 weeks ago from vacation in Asia where she tried many new foods. Her family history is significant for multiple cancers in close relatives. Physical exam reveals swollen ulcers on her legs, and colonoscopy reveals contiguous ulcerations from the rectum through the descending colon. Which of the following is associated with the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms? (C) Noncaseating granulomas (B) HLA-DQ2 positivity (D) Perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (E) Severe aortic stenosis (A) Gram-negative rod
Reason: The answer is (D) Perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies because the patient presents with symptoms consistent with ulcerative colitis, which is often associated with these antibodies. The bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, and colonoscopic findings of contiguous ulcerations align with this inflammatory bowel disease, and perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies are known to be markers associated with it.

Question: A 32-year-old man presents to the clinic with a dull low back pain radiating to the buttocks. He first noted it about 2 years ago and it has; progressed since then. He notes that it is worse in the morning and improves later in the day after physical activity. The patient also reports morning stiffness lasting up to 30 minutes and blurred vision, which started about 7 months ago. The patient’s vital signs include: blood pressure 130/80 mm Hg, heart rate 88/min, respiratory rate 16/min, and temperature 36.8°C (98.2°F). Physical examination reveals tenderness over the sacroiliac joints and limitation of the lumbar spine movements in the sagittal plane. The patient’s X-ray is shown in the picture below. Which of the following HLA variants is associated with this patient’s condition? (A) HLA-DQ2 (B) HLA-DR4 (C) HLA-B47 (D) HLA-B27 (E) HLA-DR3
Reason: The answer is (D) HLA-B27 because this HLA variant is strongly associated with ankylosing spondylitis, a form of inflammatory arthritis that primarily affects the spine and the sacroiliac joints, as seen in this patient with low back pain, morning stiffness, and sacroiliac joint tenderness. The symptoms of worsening pain in the morning and improving with activity are characteristic of ankylosing spondylitis, making HLA-B27 a pivotal marker in diagnosing this condition.

Question: A 24-year-old woman calls her gynecologist complaining of vaginal odor and vaginal discharge. She had an intrauterine device placed last year and does not use condoms with her boyfriend. She has a past medical history of constipation and depression. She recently was successfully treated for a urinary tract infection with a 2-day course of antibiotics. Physical exam demonstrates an off-white vaginal discharge and a strong odor. Pelvic exam demonstrates an absence of cervical motion tenderness and no adnexal tenderness. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? (A) Anaerobic bacteria overgrowth within the vagina (E) Pregnancy within the uterine tubes (D) Physiologic discharge secondary to normal hormonal fluctuations (C) Insufficiently treated urinary tract infection (B) Inflammatory bacterial infection
Reason: The answer is (A) Anaerobic bacteria overgrowth within the vagina because the patient's symptoms of vaginal odor and off-white discharge, combined with her recent antibiotic treatment for a urinary tract infection, suggest a disruption in normal vaginal flora. This disruption can lead to overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria, often resulting in a condition such as bacterial vaginosis, which is commonly associated with a fishy odor.

Question: A 19-year-old nulligravid woman comes to the physician because of irregular heavy menstrual bleeding since menarche at age 16 years. Menses occur at irregular 15- to 45-day intervals and last 7 to 10 days. She has also noted increased hair growth on her face. She has not been sexually active since she started taking isotretinoin for acne vulgaris 4 months ago. Her 70-year-old grandmother has breast cancer. She is 163 cm (5 ft 4 in) tall and weighs 74 kg (163 lb); BMI is 28 kg/m2. Pelvic examination shows copious cervical mucus and slightly enlarged irregular ovaries. If left untreated, this patient is at an increased risk for which of the following complications? (E) Breast cancer (C) Osteoporosis (B) Thyroid lymphoma (A) Endometrial cancer (D) Proximal myopathy
Reason: This patient's presentation suggests polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which is characterized by irregular menstrual cycles, hirsutism, and enlarged ovaries. Women with PCOS are at an increased risk for endometrial cancer, especially due to prolonged unopposed estrogen exposure from anovulation, which can occur when menstruation is irregular.

Question: A previously healthy 57-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of a 3-day history of fever and headache. He also has nausea and vomited twice in the past 24 hours. His temperature is 39.1°C (102.4°F). He is lethargic but oriented to person, place, and time. Examination shows severe neck rigidity with limited active and passive range of motion. A lumbar puncture is performed; cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows a neutrophilic pleocytosis and a decreased glucose concentration. A Gram stain of the patient's cerebrospinal fluid is most likely to show which of the following? (E) Gram-positive bacilli (D) Encapsulated, gram-positive cocci in pairs (B) Gram-positive cocci in clusters (A) Non-encapsulated, gram-negative cocci in pairs (C) Gram-negative bacilli
Reason: The clinical presentation and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis indicate a likely case of bacterial meningitis, characterized by fever, headache, neck rigidity, neutrophilic pleocytosis, and decreased glucose levels in the CSF. The Gram stain result of encapsulated, gram-positive cocci in pairs strongly suggests the presence of Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is a common cause of bacterial meningitis in adults.

Question: A 67-year-old man presents to the emergency department for altered mental status. The patient is a member of a retirement community and was found to have a depressed mental status when compared to his baseline. The patient has a past medical history of Alzheimer dementia and diabetes mellitus that is currently well-controlled. His temperature is 103°F (39.4°C), blood pressure is 157/108 mmHg, pulse is 110/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for a somnolent elderly man who is non-verbal; however, his baseline status is unknown. Musculoskeletal exam of the patient’s lower extremities causes him to recoil in pain. Head and neck exam reveals a decreased range of motion of the patient's neck. Flexion of the neck causes discomfort in the patient. No lymphadenopathy is detected. Basic labs are ordered and a urine sample is collected. Which of the following is the best next step in management? (B) Ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and ampicillin (C) Ceftriaxone, vancomycin, ampicillin, and steroids (E) Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (D) CT scan of the head (A) Ceftriaxone and vancomycin
Reason: The answer is (C) Ceftriaxone, vancomycin, ampicillin, and steroids. In this case, the patient presents with altered mental status, fever, and signs of meningeal irritation (decreased neck range of motion and discomfort on neck flexion), which raises suspicion for bacterial meningitis, particularly given his age and altered cognition. The combination of ceftriaxone and vancomycin provides broad coverage for common pathogens, while the addition of ampicillin addresses Listeria monocytogenes, especially in elderly patients. Steroids are included in the management to reduce inflammation and complications associated with bacterial meningitis.
Answer: (C) Ceftriaxone, vancomycin, ampicillin, and steroids

Question: A 16-year-old male adolescent presents to his pediatrician with increasing fatigue and breathlessness with exercise. His parents inform the doctor that they have recently migrated from a developing country, where he was diagnosed as having a large ventricular septal defect (VSD). However, due to their poor economic condition and scarce medical facilities, surgical repair was not performed in that country. The pediatrician explains to the parents that patients with large VSDs are at increased risk for several complications, including Eisenmenger syndrome. If the patient has developed this complication, he is not a good candidate for surgical closure of the defect. Which of the following clinical signs, if present on physical examination, would suggest the presence of this complication? (E) Lateral displacement of the apical impulse (A) A loud first heart sound (D) Prominence of the left precordium (C) Right ventricular heave (B) A mid-diastolic low-pitched rumble at the apex
Reason: The answer is (C) Right ventricular heave. In cases of Eisenmenger syndrome, the large left-to-right shunt from a ventricular septal defect can lead to pulmonary hypertension and subsequent right ventricular overload. A right ventricular heave is indicative of right ventricular hypertrophy, which occurs in response to the increased pressure and volume load due to the complications of the VSD, thus suggesting the development of Eisenmenger syndrome.
Answer: (C) Right ventricular heave

Question: A 22-year-old nulligravid woman comes to the physician for evaluation of irregular periods. Menarche was at the age of 12 years. Her menses have always occurred at variable intervals, and she has spotting between her periods. Her last menstrual period was 6 months ago. She has diabetes mellitus type 2 and depression. She is not sexually active. She drinks 3 alcoholic drinks on weekends and does not smoke. She takes metformin and sertraline. She appears well. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 82/min, respirations are 15/min, and blood pressure is 118/75 mm Hg. BMI is 31.5 kg/m2. Physical exam shows severe cystic acne on her face and back. There are dark, velvet-like patches on the armpits and neck. Pelvic examination is normal. A urine pregnancy test is negative. Which of the following would help determine the cause of this patient's menstrual irregularities? (B) Progesterone withdrawal test (E) Administration of estrogen (D) Measurement of prolactin levels (C) Measurement of thyroid-stimulating hormone (A) Measurement of follicle-stimulating hormone
Reason: The answer is (B) Progesterone withdrawal test. This patient’s symptoms, including irregular periods, anovulation (as suggested by her lack of menstruation for the past six months), and physical signs of hyperandrogenism (like severe cystic acne), are consistent with anovulatory cycles commonly seen in conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). The progesterone withdrawal test can help determine if there is sufficient estrogen production; if the patient has a withdrawal bleed after the administration of progesterone, it would indicate that the endometrium is responsive and that anovulation is the primary issue rather than a lack of estrogen.
Answer: (B) Progesterone withdrawal test

Question: A 24-year-old professional athlete is advised to train in the mountains to enhance his performance. After 5 months of training at an altitude of 1.5 km (5,000 feet), he is able to increase his running pace while competing at sea-level venues. Which of the following changes would produce the same effect on the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve as this athlete's training did? (C) Decreased 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (D) Increased carbon monoxide inhalation (A) Decreased pH (B) Decreased temperature (E) Increased partial pressure of oxygen
Reason: Decreased pH leads to increased acidity, which shifts the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve to the right, meaning hemoglobin releases oxygen more readily at the tissues. This effect is similar to the physiological adaptations observed in athletes training at high altitudes, where the body enhances oxygen delivery to tissues despite lower oxygen availability.
Answer: (A) Decreased pH

Question: A 45-year-old obese woman presents to the office complaining of intermittent chest pain for the past 3 days. She states that the pain worsens when she lays down and after she eats her meals. She thinks that she has experienced similar pain before but does not remember it lasting this long. She also complains of a bitter taste in her mouth but is otherwise in no apparent distress. She has a history of asthma, a partial hysterectomy 4 years ago, and hypothyroidism that was diagnosed 7 years ago. She admits to drinking 5–6 cans of beer on weekend nights. Her blood pressure is 130/90 mm Hg, and her heart rate is 105/min. An ECG is performed that shows no abnormal findings. Which of the following is the most likely cause of her pain? (A) Erosion of the mucosa of the antrum of the stomach (B) Autodigestion of pancreatic tissue (E) Decreased lower esophageal sphincter tone (D) An atherosclerotic blockage of a coronary artery causing transient ischemia during times of increased cardiac demand (C) Blockage of the cystic duct leading to inflammation of the wall of the gallbladder
Reason: The patient's symptoms, including intermittent chest pain that worsens when lying down and after meals, along with the bitter taste in her mouth, strongly suggest gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Decreased lower esophageal sphincter tone is a common cause of GERD, leading to the reflux of stomach contents into the esophagus, which can result in the described pain and associated symptoms.

He has a history of congestive heart failure, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. Current medications include metoprolol, lisinopril, spironolactone, metformin, and simvastatin. He has smoked half a pack of cigarettes daily for the past 25 years. His temperature is 38.5°C (101.3°F), pulse is 95/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 120/84 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 93%. Examination shows dullness to percussion and an increased tactile fremitus in the right lower lung field. Auscultation over this area shows bronchial breath sounds and whispered pectoriloquy. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of these findings? (E) Pulmonary infarction (A) Parenchymal consolidation (C) Alveolar transudate (B) Pleural fluid accumulation (D) Ruptured pulmonary blebs
Reason: Parenchymal consolidation is the most likely cause of these findings, as demonstrated by the dullness to percussion, increased tactile fremitus, and the presence of bronchial breath sounds in the right lower lung field. This clinical picture suggests an underlying infection or inflammation of the lung tissue, such as pneumonia, leading to the accumulation of fluid or cells in the alveoli, which results in the described examination findings.

Question: A 42-year-old woman comes to the physician with a 6-month history of breast tenderness and menstrual irregularities. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. An ultrasound of the pelvis shows a right adnexal mass. A laparoscopic right salpingo-oophorectomy is performed. Histologic examination of the adnexal mass shows small cuboidal cells arranged in clusters surrounding a central cavity with eosinophilic secretions. These cells resemble primordial follicles. Which of the following laboratory values was most likely increased in this patient at the time of presentation? (C) α-fetoprotein (D) β-human chorionic gonadotropin (E) Follicle stimulating hormone (A) Estradiol (B) Lactate dehydrogenase
Reason: The laboratory value that was most likely increased in this patient at the time of presentation is (A) Estradiol. The description of the adnexal mass, characterized by small cuboidal cells resembling primordial follicles and surrounded by eosinophilic secretions, suggests the presence of an estrogen-secreting tumor, likely a type of ovarian tumor such as a granulosa cell tumor. Elevated estradiol levels would account for the symptoms of breast tenderness and menstrual irregularities experienced by the patient.

Question: A 34-year-old G2P2 undergoes colposcopy due to high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia detected on a Pap smear. Her 2 previous Pap smears showed low-grade intraepithelial neoplasia. She has had 2 sexual partners in her life, and her husband has been her only sexual partner for the last 10 years. She had her sexual debut at 16 years of age. She had her first pregnancy at 26 years of age. She uses oral contraceptives for birth control. Her medical history is significant for right ovary resection due to a large follicular cyst and cocaine abuse for which she completed a rehabilitation program. Colposcopy reveals an acetowhite lesion with distorted vascularity at 4 o’clock. A directed biopsy shows the following on histologic evaluation. Which of the following factors present in this patient is a risk factor for the detected condition? (D) History of cocaine abuse (B) Age of sexual debut (C) Ovarian surgery (A) Patient age (E) Age at first pregnancy
Reason: The answer is (B) Age of sexual debut because an early age of sexual initiation is a known risk factor for the development of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and subsequent cervical cancer. This is likely due to a higher likelihood of exposure to human papillomavirus (HPV), which is a primary causative agent in cervical dysplasia and neoplasia.

There is pronounced clonus in the extremities bilaterally. Babinski sign is present bilaterally. All the patient’s medications are discontinued, and intravenous fluids are started. Which of the following drugs most likely interacted with phenelzine to cause this patient’s condition? (B) Bupropion (C) Sertraline (A) Mirtazapine (E) Lithium (D) Olanzapine
Reason: The patient's symptoms suggest a case of serotonin syndrome, which can occur when monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) like phenelzine interact with other serotonergic medications. Sertraline, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), is known to increase serotonin levels, and in combination with phenelzine, it can lead to the rapid onset of the severe symptoms described in this case, such as hyperthermia, autonomic dysregulation, and altered mental status.
Answer: (C) Sertraline

Question: A 27-year-old G2P1 woman is diagnosed with an HIV infection after undergoing routine prenatal blood work testing. Her estimated gestational age by first-trimester ultrasound is 12 weeks. Her CD4 count is 150 cells/mm^3 and her viral load is 126,000 copies/mL. She denies experiencing any symptoms of HIV infection. Which of the following is appropriate management of this patient's pregnancy? (C) HAART (E) Vaginal delivery (B) Breastfeeding (A) Avoidance of antibiotic prophylaxis (D) HAART after delivery
Reason: The appropriate management for this patient includes starting highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) during pregnancy to reduce viral load and improve maternal health, as well as to minimize the risk of vertical transmission of HIV to the fetus. Given her low CD4 count and high viral load, initiating HAART is crucial to ensure the best outcomes for both the mother and the baby throughout her pregnancy.
Answer: (C) HAART

Question: A 2-month-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his mother because of an 8-hour history of difficulty feeding and decreased arousability. His mother says that the symptoms began after he rolled over and fell from the bed. His vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows regions of purple discoloration in the T4–T10 dermatomes bilaterally and tense fontanelles. Fundoscopy shows bilateral optic disc swelling with dot-and-blot hemorrhages extending to the ora serrata. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? (C) Bacterial meningitis (E) Subdural hematoma (A) Basilar skull fracture (D) Periventricular hemorrhage (B) Epidural hematoma
Reason: The combination of the child's recent fall, difficulty feeding, decreased arousability, tense fontanelles, and the presence of purple discoloration in the dermatomes suggests that he experienced a subdural hematoma. This condition typically occurs due to the tearing of bridging veins as a result of head trauma, leading to accumulation of blood between the dura and the brain, which can present with neurological symptoms such as decreased consciousness and feeding difficulties.
Answer: (E) Subdural hematoma
[INFO] Sampling path 10 completed.
[INFO] Opinion paths:
Path 1: Let's analyze the details step by step.

The patient presents with left-sided weakness following a chiropractic neck manipulation, and the MRI shows a left C5 hemicord lesion. This suggests a Brown-Séquard syndrome, which occurs with hemisection of the spinal cord.

In Brown-Séquard syndrome:
- There is ipsilateral (same side as the lesion) loss of motor function and spastic paralysis due to corticospinal tract involvement.
- There is contralateral (opposite side to the lesion) loss of pain and temperature sensation due to the crossing of spinothalamic tract fibers.
- There is ipsilateral loss of vibration and proprioception due to the involvement of dorsal columns.

Now examining the options:
- (A) Spastic paralysis at the level of the lesion: This is true for the side of the lesion but doesn't answer the question about "other finding."
- (B) Right-sided Horner's syndrome: This would occur with involvement of the sympathetic fibers but is not a typical finding in a hemicord syndrome.
- (C) Contralateral corticospinal tract involvement: This is not correct; the corticospinal tract is ipsilateral in Brown-Séquard syndrome.
- (D) Right-sided analgesia: This would be true due to contralateral spinothalamic tract involvement; this is a typical finding in Brown-Séquard syndrome.
- (E) Contralateral loss of vibration and proprioception: This is incorrect; the loss of these sensations occurs on the same side as the lesion.

Given the analysis, the most likely finding in this patient, considering the hemicord lesion, would be:

**Answer: (D) Right-sided analgesia.**
Path 2: Let's analyze the situation step by step:

The patient has experienced left-sided weakness following chiropractic neck manipulation, and the MRI reveals a left C5 hemicord lesion. This suggests that the lesion is impacting the left side of the spinal cord.

1. **Understanding Hemicord Lesion**: A hemicord lesion (Brown-Séquard syndrome) typically results in a combination of motor, sensory, and autonomic symptoms due to the disruption of different pathways in the spinal cord.

2. **Motor Symptoms**: The left-sided weakness indicates that the corticospinal tract, which carries motor signals, is affected on the left side. This results in spastic paralysis (upper motor neuron signs) on the left side below the level of the lesion.

3. **Sensory Symptoms**:
   - The corticospinal tract (which carries motor signals) is affected on the same side as the lesion, leading to left-sided weakness.
   - The spinothalamic tract (which carries pain and temperature sensations) crosses to the other side of the spinal cord. Therefore, a left hemicord lesion would typically result in loss of pain and temperature sensation on the right side (contralateral).
   - The dorsal columns (which carry vibration and proprioception sensations) remain ipsilateral until they reach the medulla; hence, there would be loss of these sensations on the same side as the lesion (left side).

4. **Autonomic Symptoms**: Horner's syndrome would be associated with lesions affecting the sympathetic pathways, particularly in the upper cervical region (above T1). However, the question does not indicate any involvement of the sympathetic chain leading to this condition.

Now, we need to select the most likely finding based on this analysis:

- **(D) Right-sided analgesia**: This would be true as the spinothalamic tract is affected contralaterally.
- **(C) Contralateral corticospinal tract involvement**: This would not be correct since the left hemicord lesion affects the left side.
- **(E) Contralateral loss of vibration and proprioception**: This is incorrect as loss of vibration and proprioception would occur on the same side as the lesion.
- **(B) Right-sided Horner's syndrome**: Unlikely unless there is direct involvement of the sympathetic chain.
- **(A) Spastic paralysis at the level of the lesion**: This is unlikely as spastic paralysis below the level of the lesion is more typical.

Given this reasoning, the best answer is:

**(D) Right-sided analgesia**.
Path 3: Let's analyze the case step by step.

The patient is a 40-year-old man who presents with left-sided weakness following chiropractic neck manipulation, and the MRI shows a left C5 hemicord lesion. This suggests he has a Brown-Sequard syndrome, which occurs due to damage to one side of the spinal cord.

In Brown-Sequard syndrome:
- There is **ipsilateral** (same side as the lesion) weakness and spastic paralysis due to corticospinal tract involvement.
- There is **contralateral** (opposite side to the lesion) loss of pain and temperature sensation due to damage to the spinothalamic tract.
- There is **ipsilateral** loss of vibration and proprioception due to damage to the dorsal columns.

Now, let's evaluate the options given:

- (D) Right-sided analgesia: This would indicate loss of pain and temperature sensation on the right side due to contralateral spinothalamic tract involvement, which is consistent with Brown-Sequard syndrome.
- (C) Contralateral corticospinal tract involvement: This would not be seen, as the weakness is ipsilateral.
- (E) Contralateral loss of vibration and proprioception: This is incorrect because loss of vibration and proprioception would occur on the same side as the lesion.
- (B) Right-sided Horner's syndrome: This is associated with lesions affecting the sympathetic pathways, which is not indicated here.
- (A) Spastic paralysis at the level of lesion: This would not be the primary finding; the weakness is more pronounced below the level of the lesion.

Given this analysis, the most likely finding that corresponds with the left C5 hemicord lesion is:

**Answer: (D) Right-sided analgesia**
Path 4: Let's analyze the situation step by step.

The patient has left-sided weakness after a chiropractic neck manipulation, and an MRI shows a left C5 hemicord lesion. Given the location of the lesion and the symptoms, we can apply our understanding of spinal cord anatomy and the effects of lesions.

1. **Left C5 Hemicord Lesion**: This affects the left side of the spinal cord at the C5 level. The corticospinal tract (which is responsible for motor control) descends contralaterally, meaning that a lesion on the left side will typically cause weakness on the right side of the body.

2. **Motor Symptoms**: The left C5 hemicord lesion will likely lead to right-sided weakness because of the involvement of the corticospinal tract. This is commonly referred to as contralateral weakness.

3. **Sensory Symptoms**: In terms of sensory findings, the left side of the cord contains the sensory pathways for proprioception and vibration. Since these pathways ascend ipsilaterally (on the same side) before crossing over at higher levels, a left C5 hemicord lesion would typically cause a loss of proprioception and vibration sense on the left side (ipsilateral). 

4. **Contralateral Findings**: However, the spinothalamic tract (which carries pain and temperature sensations) crosses over at the level of the spinal cord and therefore would be affected contralaterally. Thus, the patient would have right-sided analgesia (loss of pain and temperature sensation).

Now, considering the options:
- (D) Right-sided analgesia: This is a likely finding because of the contralateral involvement of the spinothalamic tract.
- (C) Contralateral corticospinal tract involvement: This would manifest as weakness, not paralysis, and is not the most direct answer.
- (E) Contralateral loss of vibration and proprioception: This is incorrect as those sensations would be lost on the same side as the lesion.
- (B) Right-sided Horner's syndrome: This does not relate directly to a hemicord lesion.
- (A) Spastic paralysis at the level of lesion: This would not be a key finding since the paralysis is contralateral.

Given this analysis, the most likely finding in this patient is:

**Answer: (D) Right-sided analgesia**
Path 5: Let's think step by step. In this clinical scenario, the patient presents with left-sided weakness after chiropractic manipulation, and an MRI shows a left C5 hemicord lesion. This indicates a left-sided spinal cord injury.

1. **Left C5 Hemicord Lesion**: This type of lesion typically affects the left side of the body, particularly the left corticospinal tract, which is responsible for voluntary motor control, resulting in weakness or paralysis on the left side.

2. **Motor and Sensory Pathways**:
   - The corticospinal tract carries motor fibers. A left-sided hemicord lesion would lead to weakness (spastic paralysis) on the left side of the body below the level of the lesion.
   - The spinothalamic tract carries pain and temperature sensations. Since the crossing occurs at the level of the spinal cord, a left-sided lesion would affect the right side's pain and temperature sensation (right-sided analgesia).
   - The dorsal columns (which transmit proprioception and vibration sense) would also be affected, causing loss of these sensations on the same side (left side) as the lesion, but this is less relevant to the answer choices.

3. **Options Analysis**:
   - (A) Spastic paralysis at the level of lesion: This might occur but is less likely to be the most significant finding.
   - (B) Right-sided Horner's syndrome: This would not be associated with a hemicord lesion at C5.
   - (C) Contralateral corticospinal tract involvement: This would not be applicable as the lesion is on the left side, affecting the left side's motor pathways.
   - (D) Right-sided analgesia: This is consistent with a left-sided hemicord lesion affecting the right side's pain and temperature sensation.
   - (E) Contralateral loss of vibration and proprioception: This is incorrect because the loss would occur on the same side as the lesion.

Given this analysis, the most likely additional finding in this patient would be:

**Answer: (D) Right-sided analgesia**.
Path 6: Let's think step by step. 

The key details in the scenario include the patient's left-sided weakness following neck manipulation and the MRI findings of a left C5 hemicord lesion. 

1. **Understanding the Hemicord Lesion:** A left C5 hemicord lesion would primarily affect the left side of the body due to damage to the corticospinal tract (which carries motor signals) as well as potentially affecting sensory pathways. 

2. **Motor Symptoms:** The left-sided weakness indicates that there is upper motor neuron involvement on the left side, leading to spastic paralysis. However, the question is asking for the most likely associated finding.

3. **Sensory Symptoms:** In a hemicord lesion (Brown-Séquard syndrome), the following would typically occur:
   - Ipsilateral loss of motor function and proprioception/vibration sense (due to corticospinal and dorsal column involvement).
   - Contralateral loss of pain and temperature sensation (due to spinothalamic tract involvement).

4. **Analysis of Options:**
   - (D) Right-sided analgesia: This would be expected due to contralateral involvement of the spinothalamic tract affecting pain sensation.
   - (C) Contralateral corticospinal tract involvement: This is incorrect because the corticospinal tract on the left side is primarily affected, not the right.
   - (E) Contralateral loss of vibration and proprioception: This is incorrect as these sensations are lost on the same side as the lesion (left).
   - (B) Right-sided Horner's syndrome: This is not applicable in this context as Horner's syndrome is related to sympathetic chain involvement typically affecting the eye/face.
   - (A) Spastic paralysis at the level of the lesion: This is true but not the best answer since we are looking for findings that would likely be seen in this patient as a broader symptomology.

Given this analysis, the most likely additional finding in this patient with a left C5 hemicord lesion would be:

**Answer: (D) Right-sided analgesia** (due to the contralateral spinothalamic tract involvement).
Path 7: To analyze the scenario step by step:

1. **Patient Presentation:** The patient is a 40-year-old businessman with left-sided weakness following chiropractic neck manipulation. This suggests a possible cervical spine injury or vascular event affecting the spinal cord.

2. **MRI Findings:** The MRI shows a left C5 hemicord lesion. A hemicord lesion would typically affect the left side of the cord where it is damaged.

3. **Neurological Effects of Hemicord Lesion:** 
   - Damage to the corticospinal tract on the left side would lead to left-sided weakness (motor function deficit).
   - The loss of pain and temperature sensation occurs on the right side due to the crossing of the spinothalamic tract fibers, which ascend contralaterally.
   - The dorsal columns, which carry vibration and proprioception, are also affected, leading to loss of these modalities on the same side as the lesion.

4. **Considering the Options:**
   - (D) Right-sided analgesia: This is likely because the spinothalamic tract would be affected on the right side.
   - (C) Contralateral corticospinal tract involvement: This does not apply since the lesion is on the left, affecting the left side.
   - (E) Contralateral loss of vibration and proprioception: This is incorrect; loss occurs on the same side as the lesion.
   - (B) Right-sided Horner's syndrome: This would suggest involvement of the sympathetic pathways, which is not indicated in this case.
   - (A) Spastic paralysis at the level of lesion: This is less likely because spastic paralysis typically occurs below the level of a lesion due to upper motor neuron involvement.

5. **Conclusion:** The most likely finding in this patient, given the left C5 hemicord lesion and the described deficits, would be **right-sided analgesia** due to the involvement of the spinothalamic tract that carries pain and temperature sensations.

**Final Answer:** (D) Right-sided analgesia.
Path 8: To analyze this case, we need to understand the implications of the left C5 hemicord lesion.

1. **Left C5 Hemicord Lesion**: A hemicord lesion typically affects half of the spinal cord. In this case, the left side of the spinal cord is affected.

2. **Motor and Sensory Pathways**:
   - The **corticospinal tract**, which is responsible for voluntary motor control, decussates (crosses over) at the level of the medulla. Therefore, a lesion on the left side would cause weakness (spastic paralysis) on the same side (left side), affecting the left arm and potentially left leg, depending on the extent of the lesion.
   - The **spinothalamic tract**, which carries pain and temperature sensations, crosses over at the level of the spinal cord. Therefore, a left-sided hemicord lesion would cause contralateral (right-sided) loss of pain and temperature sensation.
   - The **dorsal columns**, responsible for vibration and proprioception, also cross over but at the level of the medulla. Thus, a left C5 lesion would lead to contralateral loss of vibration and proprioception.

3. **Considering the Options**:
   - (D) Right-sided analgesia (contralateral loss of pain and temperature) is likely due to spinothalamic tract involvement.
   - (C) Contralateral corticospinal tract involvement would not be seen directly as a result of the left hemicord lesion; the left side would show weakness, not the right.
   - (E) Contralateral loss of vibration and proprioception would also occur due to involvement of the dorsal columns, as explained above.
   - (B) Right-sided Horner's syndrome is not typically associated with a hemicord lesion at C5.
   - (A) Spastic paralysis at the level of the lesion would occur in the left arm due to the left-sided lesion.

Given the information, the most likely finding associated with a left C5 hemicord lesion is:

**Answer: (D) Right-sided analgesia** (contralateral loss of pain and temperature sensation).
Path 9: Let's analyze the scenario step by step:

1. **Patient Presentation**: The patient is a 40-year-old man who presents with left-sided weakness after a chiropractic neck manipulation. This suggests a possible cervical spine injury or neurological compromise.

2. **MRI Findings**: A T2-weighted MRI shows a left C5 hemicord lesion. A hemicord lesion at the cervical level typically indicates an injury that affects only one side of the spinal cord.

3. **Understanding Hemicord Lesion Effects**:
   - In the context of a left C5 hemicord lesion:
     - The corticospinal tract (which controls voluntary movement) runs down the spinal cord and crosses over at the level of the medulla. Damage to the left side would lead to weakness on the right side (contralateral weakness).
     - The spinothalamic tract, which carries pain and temperature sensations, would also be affected on the opposite side (right side).
     - The dorsal columns, responsible for proprioception and vibration sense, would be affected on the same side (left side).

4. **Evaluating Options**:
   - (D) Right-sided analgesia: This is consistent with damage to the spinothalamic tract due to the left hemicord lesion, leading to loss of pain/temperature sensation on the right side.
   - (C) Contralateral corticospinal tract involvement: This would be correct in terms of weakness, but the question is asking for the most likely finding.
   - (E) Contralateral loss of vibration and proprioception: This is incorrect because loss of vibration and proprioception would occur on the same side as the lesion (left side).
   - (B) Right-sided Horner's syndrome: This is unlikely as Horner's syndrome typically results from disruption of sympathetic pathways, which is not directly indicated by a hemicord lesion.
   - (A) Spastic paralysis at the level of the lesion: This would not be the main finding; the weakness would be more prominent on the opposite side.

Given this analysis, the most likely additional finding in this patient would be:

**Answer**: (D) Right-sided analgesia
Path 10: Let's analyze the clinical scenario step by step:

1. The patient experienced left-sided weakness after a chiropractic neck manipulation, suggesting a potential injury to the cervical spinal cord.
2. The MRI findings indicate a left C5 hemicord lesion. This suggests an injury that is affecting the left side of the spinal cord at the C5 level.
3. In a hemicord lesion (Brown-Séquard syndrome), the following typical findings can be expected:
   - Ipsilateral (same side as the lesion) loss of motor function and proprioception/vibration sense due to corticospinal and dorsal column tract involvement.
   - Contralateral (opposite side) loss of pain and temperature sensation due to damage to the spinothalamic tract.

Now, let's evaluate the options:
- (A) Spastic paralysis at the level of the lesion: This is not correct; spastic paralysis occurs below the level of the lesion.
- (B) Right-sided Horner's syndrome: This is typically associated with lesions affecting the sympathetic pathways, which is not indicated here.
- (C) Contralateral corticospinal tract involvement: This is incorrect because the corticospinal tract on the same side as the lesion is affected (left side), leading to weakness on the left side.
- (D) Right-sided analgesia: This is correct; the patient is likely to have contralateral (right-sided) loss of pain and temperature sensation due to the involvement of the spinothalamic tract.
- (E) Contralateral loss of vibration and proprioception: Incorrect because vibration and proprioception are lost on the same side as the lesion, not contralaterally.

Therefore, the most likely finding in this patient given the left C5 hemicord lesion is:

**Answer: (D) Right-sided analgesia.**

Question: A 13-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his parents, who are concerned about recurrent muscle cramps he experiences while playing soccer. The boy has always loved sports and has been playing in a soccer league for the past 3 years. He now complains of severe cramping pain in his legs after intense practice sessions. He has no significant medical history. His physical examination is unremarkable. A battery of laboratory tests is ordered and they are all normal. Imaging studies yield no abnormalities as well. Which of the following is most likely deficient in this patient? (E) Reye syndrome (A) Carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (C) Medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase (B) Carnitine palmitoyltransferase II (D) Myophosphorylase
Reason: The answer is (B) Carnitine palmitoyltransferase II. This condition is associated with exercise-induced muscle cramps, particularly in teenagers involved in intense physical activities, due to impaired fatty acid oxidation. The symptoms align with a deficiency in this enzyme, as it plays a critical role in transporting long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria for energy production, which can lead to muscle cramping during vigorous exercise when such energy is required.
Answer: (B) Carnitine palmitoyltransferase II

Question: A 27-year-old woman is admitted to the emergency room with dyspnea which began after swimming and progressed gradually over the last 3 days. She denies cough, chest pain, or other respiratory symptoms. She reports that for the past 4 months, she has had several dyspneic episodes that occurred after the exercising and progressed at rest, but none of these were as long as the current one. Also, she notes that her tongue becomes ‘wadded’ when she speaks and she tires very quickly during the day. The patient’s vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 125/60 mm Hg, heart rate 92/min, respiratory rate 34/min, and body temperature 36.2℃ (97.2℉). Blood saturation on room air is initially 92% but falls to 90% as she speaks up. On physical examination, the patient is slightly lethargic. Her breathing is rapid and shallow. Lung auscultation, as well as cardiac, and abdominal examinations show no remarkable findings. Neurological examination reveals slight bilateral ptosis increased by repetitive blinking, and easy fatigability of muscles on repeated movement worse on the face and distal muscles of the upper and lower extremities. Which arterial blood gas parameters would you expect to see in this patient? (B) PaCO2 = 43 mm Hg, PaO2 = 55 mm Hg (E) PaCO2 = 37 mm Hg, PaO2= 46 mm Hg (A) PaCO2 = 34 mm Hg, PaO2 = 61 mm Hg (C) PaCO2 = 31 mm Hg, PaO2 = 67 mm Hg (D) PaCO2 = 51 mm Hg, PaO2 = 58 mm Hg
Reason: The answer is (D) PaCO2 = 51 mm Hg, PaO2 = 58 mm Hg. This patient exhibits signs of respiratory failure characterized by her dyspnea, hypoxemia (evidenced by low oxygen saturation), and muscle weakness with features consistent with a neuromuscular disorder such as myasthenia gravis. The elevated PaCO2 indicates hypercapnia due to inadequate ventilation and respiratory muscle fatigue, while the low PaO2 reflects significant hypoxemia. This combination aligns with the severe respiratory distress the patient is experiencing.
Answer: (D) PaCO2 = 51 mm Hg, PaO2 = 58 mm Hg

Question: A 50-year-old woman presents to the outpatient clinic because of a swollen and enlarged right breast. Clinical examination shows no evidence of mass or axillary lymphadenopathy. There is no history of trauma or inflammation. Her past medical and surgical history is positive for breast augmentation with a textured implant 15 years ago. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows an accumulation of fluid around the right breast implant with intact implant integrity. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management? (E) Chemotherapy (C) Mammogram (B) Surgical replacement of textured implant with a smooth implant (A) Mastectomy (D) Cytological analysis for CD30 and ALK
Reason: The answer is (D) Cytological analysis for CD30 and ALK. The patient's symptoms and MRI findings suggest the possibility of an anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) associated with breast implants, specifically textured implants, which can lead to seroma formation and fluid accumulation. In this case, analyzing the fluid for CD30 and ALK markers is crucial for confirming the diagnosis of ALCL before considering further management steps such as surgery or additional treatment.
Answer: (D) Cytological analysis for CD30 and ALK

Question: A 70-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 4-month history of fatigue, worsening swelling of her ankles, and a 5-kg (11-lb) weight gain. Neurologic examination shows diminished two-point discrimination in her fingers. Laboratory studies show a hemoglobin A1c concentration of 9.2% and a creatinine concentration of 1.3 mg/dL. Urine dipstick shows heavy proteinuria. A biopsy specimen of this patient's kidney is most likely to show which of the following? (D) Wire looping of capillaries (C) Interstitial inflammation (E) Nodular glomerulosclerosis (A) Split glomerular basement membrane (B) Immune complex deposition
Reason: This patient's presentation, characterized by fatigue, worsening edema, proteinuria, and elevated hemoglobin A1c, suggests diabetic nephropathy, a common complication of poorly controlled diabetes. In diabetic nephropathy, the renal biopsy typically reveals nodular glomerulosclerosis, which is characterized by the presence of Kimmelstiel-Wilson nodules, indicative of long-standing hyperglycemia and its effects on the kidneys.
Answer: (E) Nodular glomerulosclerosis

Question: Immediately following prolonged delivery of the placenta at 40 weeks gestation, a 32-year-old multiparous woman develops vaginal bleeding. Other than mild asthma, the patient’s pregnancy has been uncomplicated. She has attended many prenatal appointments and followed the physician's advice about screening for diseases, laboratory testing, diet, and exercise. Previous pregnancies were uncomplicated. She has no history of a serious illness. She is currently on intravenous infusion of oxytocin. Her temperature is 37.2°C (99.0°F), blood pressure is 108/60 mm Hg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 17/min. Uterine palpation reveals a soft enlarged fundus that extends above the umbilicus. Based on the assessment of the birth canal and placenta, which of the following options is the most appropriate initial step in patient management? (C) Intravenous methylergonovine (D) Manual exploration of the uterus (E) Uterine fundal massage (B) Intramuscular carboprost (A) Discontinuing oxytocin
Reason: The patient's presentation of a soft and enlarged fundus suggests uterine atony, which is a common cause of postpartum bleeding. Uterine fundal massage is the appropriate initial management step to stimulate uterine contractions and help restore uterine tone, thereby controlling the bleeding effectively before considering other interventions.
Answer: (E) Uterine fundal massage

Question: A 7-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his parents because of a 4.5-kg (10-lb) weight loss during the last 3 months. During this period, he has complained of abdominal pain and fullness, and his parents feel that he has been eating less. His parents also report that his urine has appeared pink for several weeks. He has been performing poorly in school lately, with reports from teachers that he has not been paying attention in class and has been distracting to other students. He was born at term and has been healthy except for a history of several infantile seizures. His vital signs are within normal limits. He is at the 60th percentile for height and 20th percentile for weight. Physical examination shows a palpable abdominal mass, abdominal tenderness in the left upper quadrant, and left costovertebral angle tenderness. There are several ellipsoid, hypopigmented macules on the back and legs and a 4-cm raised plaque of rough, dimpled skin on the right lower back that is the same color as the surrounding skin. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? (D) Tuberous sclerosis (E) Neurofibromatosis type 2 (A) Von Hippel‑Lindau disease (B) Neurofibromatosis type 1 (C) Sturge-Weber syndrome
Reason: The patient's symptoms and clinical findings, including the abdominal mass, hypopigmented macules (Ash leaf spots), and a dimpled skin plaque (likely a shagreen patch), are characteristic of tuberous sclerosis. Additionally, his history of infantile seizures and developmental issues further supports this diagnosis, as tuberous sclerosis is commonly associated with seizures and neurodevelopmental problems.

She denies any vaginal discharge or foul smell. She is in a monogamous relationship with her husband of 2 years. She has no history of any serious illnesses. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows tenderness on deep palpation of the hypogastrium. A speculum examination of the vagina and cervix shows no abnormalities or discharge. Serum studies show a beta hCG of 6 mIU/mL. A transabdominal ultrasound shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is most likely to establish a diagnosis? (E) Wet-mount test (B) Cancer antigen 125 (CA-125) (C) Laparoscopy (D) Dilation and curettage (A) Abdominopelvic computed tomography (CT) scan
Reason: Laparoscopy is the most effective method for diagnosing conditions such as endometriosis or pelvic adhesions, which could be causing the patient's symptoms of deep pain during intercourse and pelvic pain that intensifies before menstruation. Despite normal ultrasound findings and negative serum studies, the invasive nature of laparoscopy allows direct visualization of the pelvic organs, providing a more definitive diagnosis in cases where other non-invasive tests have been inconclusive.
Answer: (C) Laparoscopy

Question: A 19-year-old female college student is brought into the emergency department by her boyfriend. The boyfriend reports that the patient got caught stealing from the company she works for and subsequently got fired. The boyfriend received a text that evening saying “I’ll miss you.” When he arrived at her dorm room, the patient was slumped in the shower covered in blood. The patient agreed to be driven to the emergency room. When asked about what happened, the patient replies “I just want out of this life.” The patient has bipolar disorder, and takes lithium as prescribed. She has a psychiatrist she sees every week, which the boyfriend confirms. She has never had a prior suicide attempt nor has she ever been hospitalized for a psychiatric disorder. The patient’s vitals are stable. Upon physical examination, a 4 centimeter vertical incision is noted on the patient’s left forearm. During the patient’s laceration repair, she asks if she will be admitted. She states, “these ups and downs are common for me, but I feel better now.” She verbalizes that she understands that she overreacted. She asks to go home, and her boyfriend insists that he will stay with her. They both confirm that neither of them have guns or know any peers with access to guns. Which of the following is the most appropriate management for the patient? (B) Discontinue lithium and start valproate (E) Set up a next-day appointment with the patient’s psychiatrist (D) Involuntarily admit the patient (A) Call the patient’s parents (C) Have the patient sign a suicide contract before discharge
Reason: Involuntary admission is warranted in this case due to the patient's expression of suicidal ideation and the serious nature of her actions, including self-harm and a statement indicating a desire to escape her life. Given her recent crisis, coupled with her history of bipolar disorder and the potential for further self-harm, this intervention ensures that she receives appropriate psychiatric evaluation and stabilization in a safe environment, minimizing the immediate risk to her health and well-being.
Answer: (D) Involuntarily admit the patient

Question: A 19-year-old girl comes to the physician for evaluation after a minor motor vehicle collision. While driving down a residential street, a young boy ran out in front of her, chasing after a ball. She applied the brakes of her vehicle and avoided hitting the boy, but then she suddenly experienced generalized weakness that rendered her unable to operate the vehicle and collided at low speed with a parked car. One minute later, she recovered her strength. She was uninjured. She has had several similar episodes of transient generalized weakness over the past month, once during an argument with her mother and another time while watching her favorite comedy movie. She has also had excessive daytime sleepiness for 18 months despite 9 hours of sleep nightly and 2 daily naps. She has fallen asleep in class several times. She often sees intensely bright colors as she is falling asleep. During this time, she is often unable to move; this inability to move is very distressing to her. Which of the following is the most appropriate nighttime pharmacotherapy for this patient? (B) Sodium oxybate (E) Fluoxetine (D) Duloxetine (C) Amphetamine (A) Guanfacine
Reason: Sodium oxybate is the most appropriate nighttime pharmacotherapy for this patient due to her symptoms consistent with narcolepsy, which include excessive daytime sleepiness and episodes of sudden muscle weakness (cataplexy). Sodium oxybate is specifically approved for treating narcolepsy and helps to improve both nighttime sleep quality and daytime alertness, addressing the underlying issues contributing to her symptoms.
Answer: (B) Sodium oxybate

Question: An esophageal biopsy sample from a 47-year-old male with chronic heartburn reveals intestinal metaplasia. Which of the following abnormal cell types is likely present in this patient’s esophagus: (B) Keratinized stratified squamous epithelium (D) Goblet cells (A) Pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium (C) Simple cuboidal epithelium (E) Polymorphonuclear leukocytes
Reason: The presence of intestinal metaplasia in an esophageal biopsy suggests a transformation of the normal squamous epithelium to a type more akin to intestinal tissue, which typically includes goblet cells. In cases of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), the normal esophageal lining may undergo this change to produce mucus-secreting cells like goblet cells, indicating an adaptation to chronic injury from acidic reflux.
Answer: (D) Goblet cells

Question: A 24-year-old man comes to the physician with a 2-day history of fever, crampy abdominal pain, and blood-tinged diarrhea. He recently returned from a trip to Mexico. His temperature is 38.2°C (100.8°F). Abdominal examination shows diffuse tenderness to palpation; bowel sounds are hyperactive. Stool cultures grow nonlactose fermenting, oxidase-negative, gram-negative rods that do not produce hydrogen sulfide on triple sugar iron agar. Which of the following processes is most likely involved in the pathogenesis of this patient's condition? (A) Invasion of colonic microfold cells (C) Overactivation of adenylate cyclase (D) Dissemination via bloodstream (B) Inhibition of host cytoskeleton organization (E) Flagella-mediated gut colonization
Reason: The clinical presentation and stool culture findings suggest an infectious gastroenteritis, likely caused by a pathogen that invades cells in the intestinal lining. Non-lactose fermenting, oxidase-negative, gram-negative rods that do not produce hydrogen sulfide are characteristics of certain bacteria that can invade intestinal cells, leading to symptoms such as abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, which aligns with the pathogenesis involving the invasion of colonic microfold cells.
Answer: (A) Invasion of colonic microfold cells

Question: A 21-year-old man presents to an outpatient psychiatrist with chief complaints of fatigue and “hearing voices.” He describes multiple voices which sometimes call his name or say nonsensical things to him before he falls asleep at night. He occasionally awakes to see “strange people” in his room, which frighten him but then disappear. The patient is particularly worried by this because his uncle developed schizophrenia when he was in his 20s. The patient also thinks he had a seizure a few days ago, saying he suddenly fell to the ground without warning, though he remembers the episode and denied any abnormal movements during it. He is in his 3rd year of college and used to be a top student, but has been getting C and D grades over the last year, as he has had trouble concentrating and fallen asleep during exams numerous times. He denies changes in mood and has continued to sleep 8 hours per night and eat 3 meals per day recently. Which of the following medications will be most beneficial for this patient? (A) Haloperidol (D) Risperidone (C) Modafinil (E) Valproic acid (B) Levetiracetam
Reason: The patient's symptoms of fatigue, concentration issues, and sleep disturbances suggest a potential underlying sleep disorder rather than a primary psychotic disorder, particularly given the absence of mood changes and the episodic nature of his experiences. Modafinil, a medication used to promote wakefulness, can help manage excessive daytime sleepiness and improve concentration, making it a suitable choice for addressing his symptoms related to fatigue and academic difficulties.
Answer: (C) Modafinil

Question: A 46-year-old woman presents to your office with oral lesions as shown in Image A. On examination, you find that her back has flaccid bullae that spread when you apply lateral pressure with your fingertips. This patient most likely has autoantibodies directed against which of the following? (E) Type VII collagen (B) Hemidesmosomes (D) Lamina lucida (A) Desmosomes (C) Lamina densa
Reason: The patient's symptoms of oral lesions and flaccid bullae that spread under pressure suggest a condition like pemphigus vulgaris, which is characterized by autoantibodies against desmosomes. Desmosomes are responsible for cell adhesion in the epidermis, and targeting them leads to the loss of cell-to-cell adhesion, resulting in the clinical presentation observed in this patient.
Answer: (A) Desmosomes

Question: A 49-year-old man with HIV comes to the physician because of a 1-month history of intermittent diarrhea and abdominal pain. Abdominal examination shows mild, diffuse tenderness throughout the lower quadrants. His CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 180/mm3 (normal ≥ 500/mm3). Colonoscopy shows multiple hemorrhagic nodules in the rectum and descending colon. Polymerase chain reaction of the lesions is positive for HHV-8. Histologic examination of the lesions is most likely to show which of the following findings? (D) Spindle-shaped cells with leukocytic infiltration (E) Mucin-filled cell with peripheral nucleus (C) Polygonal cells with racket-shaped organelles (B) Enlarged cells with intranuclear inclusion bodies (A) Cords of atypical cells with extracellular mucin
Reason: The findings in this patient, including HIV, the presence of hemorrhagic nodules, and positive polymerase chain reaction for HHV-8, strongly suggest a diagnosis of Kaposi sarcoma. Histologic examination of Kaposi sarcoma typically reveals spindle-shaped cells along with a significant leukocytic infiltrate, which aligns with the answer provided.
Answer: (D) Spindle-shaped cells with leukocytic infiltration

Question: A 25-year-old man presents with a mass on his neck. He says that he first noticed the mass a few weeks ago while taking a shower. Since then, the mass has not increased in size. He denies any pain or difficulty in swallowing. Past medical history is unremarkable. Family history is significant for his father who had his thyroid removed when he was around his age but doesn’t know why. Review of systems is significant for occasional episodes of anxiety that include a pounding headache, racing heart, and sweating. His vital signs include: pulse 88/min, blood pressure 133/87 mm Hg, temperature 37.2°C (99.0°F), and respiratory rate 14/min. He is 183 cm (6 ft 2 in) tall with long extremities. On physical examination, the patient appears cachectic. There is a palpable 4 cm x 4 cm nodule present on the left lobe of the thyroid. Which of the following is the most likely thyroid pathology in this patient? (A) Giant cell thyroiditis (C) Papillary carcinoma (E) Medullary carcinoma (D) Follicular adenoma (B) Anaplastic carcinoma
Reason: The patient's presentation, including a neck mass, family history of thyroid surgery, and symptoms suggestive of catecholamine excess (anxiety with pounding headaches and sweating), raises suspicion for medullary thyroid carcinoma, which is associated with hypersecretion of calcitonin and can occur in the context of multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndromes. Additionally, his tall stature and long extremities suggest a possible genetic syndrome, which may correlate with medullary thyroid carcinoma in his family history.

Question: A 7-year-old girl is brought to the physician because of generalized fatigue and dark urine for 1 week. Four weeks ago, she was treated with topical mupirocin for a skin infection. Her 5-year-old brother has steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 14/min, and blood pressure is 132/89 mm Hg. Examination shows periorbital and 1+ pretibial edema bilaterally. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show:
Hemoglobin 12.9 g/dL
Leukocyte count 7,200/mm3
Platelet count 230,000/mm3
Serum
Urea nitrogen 32 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.8 mg/dL
Urine
Blood 2+
Protein 2+
Glucose negative
RBC 12–14/hpf with dysmorphic features
RBC casts numerous
Which of the following is the most likely cause of these findings?" (E) Inflammation of small-sized blood vessels (C) Defective circulating IgA antibodies (A) Subepithelial immune complex deposition (D) Antibodies against cell nucleus proteins (B) Antibodies against type IV collagen
Reason: The most likely cause of these findings is (A) Subepithelial immune complex deposition. This is supported by the presence of hematuria (blood in urine), proteinuria, and renal impairment, which are indicative of glomerular injury often caused by the deposition of immune complexes in the kidney, leading to conditions such as minimal change disease or post-infectious glomerulonephritis. The patient's recent history of a skin infection treated with mupirocin and the family history of nephrotic syndrome in her brother also suggest a possible link between the infection and the development of glomerular inflammation due to immune response.

Question: A 58-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure and hypertension comes to you with the chief complaint of new-onset cough as well as increased serum potassium in the setting of a new medication. Which of the following medications is most likely responsible for these findings? (E) Lisinopril (A) Furosemide (C) Amiodarone (D) Digoxin (B) Metoprolol
Reason: The medication most likely responsible for these findings is (E) Lisinopril. This is supported by the fact that Lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor, is known to cause increases in serum potassium levels, particularly when starting treatment or adjusting doses, and can also lead to a cough due to the accumulation of bradykinin. Given the patient's history of congestive heart failure, the initiation of Lisinopril would be common for managing hypertension and heart failure, which correlates with the new-onset cough and elevated potassium levels.
Answer: (E) Lisinopril

Question: A 62-year-old man is referred to neurology by his primary care physician. He is accompanied by his wife. The patient reports having a resting tremor in his left hand for over a year and some “stiffness” in his left arm. His wife notes that he has started to walk "funny" as well. He has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He takes aspirin, amlodipine, and rosuvastatin. On physical examination, you notice a repetitive circular movement of his left index finger and thumb that resolves with active movement of the hand. Passive motion of the left upper extremity is partially limited by rigidity. Gait is slow and shuffling. The patient is prescribed the most effective treatment for his disorder. Which of the following is the mechanism of a second drug given to prevent adverse effects of this therapy? (E) Inhibits monoamine oxidase-B (D) Inhibits aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (C) Inhibits catechol-O-methyltransferase (A) Activates dopamine receptors (B) Blocks muscarinic acetylcholine receptors
Reason: The mechanism of a second drug given to prevent adverse effects of this therapy is (D) Inhibits aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase. This supports the treatment of Parkinson's disease, where the primary therapy often involves levodopa, which is converted to dopamine in the brain. Inhibiting aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase with a drug like carbidopa prevents levodopa from being converted to dopamine in the periphery, thus minimizing side effects such as nausea and allowing more levodopa to reach the brain for effective treatment.
Answer: (D) Inhibits aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase

Question: A 54-year-old man comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. One week ago, he was treated in the emergency department for chest pain, palpitations, and dyspnea. As part of his regimen, he was started on a medication that irreversibly inhibits the synthesis of thromboxane A2 and prostaglandins. Which of the following is the most likely adverse effect of this medication? (D) Tinnitus (A) Chronic rhinosinusitis (B) Acute interstitial nephritis (C) Gout attack (E) Gastrointestinal hemorrhage
Reason: The correct answer is (E) Gastrointestinal hemorrhage because the medication in question is likely aspirin, which irreversibly inhibits cyclooxygenase enzymes (COX-1 and COX-2), leading to reduced production of thromboxane A2 and prostaglandins. This inhibition can compromise the protective gastric mucosal barrier and increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
Answer: (E) Gastrointestinal hemorrhage

Question: A 48-year-old woman presents with a 15-year history of long, painful menses that is only partially relieved with oral contraceptives. She desires definitive treatment. She denies weight loss or post-coital bleeding, and her husband has been her only sexual partner. She does not have a history of smoking, alcohol or illicit drug use, or sexually transmitted diseases. She sees her gynecologist annually. She takes no medications. An abdominal ultrasound shows a non-gravid uterus with hyperechoic islands and an irregular endometrial-myometrial junction, consistent with adenomyosis. A supracervical hysterectomy and left salpingo-oophorectomy are performed without incident. Later that day, the patient’s vitals are stable: temperature 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate 98/min, respiratory rate 15/min, blood pressure 100/75 mm Hg, breathing 100% oxygen on room air. The patient is not in acute distress with a Foley catheter in place. The physical exam is unremarkable. However, she has only excreted a minimal amount of urine output in the past several hours after surgery. Only 10cc or urine is produced over the next 12 hours. A bladder scan shows minimal residual urine. CBC, CMP, and urinalysis are ordered, and renal ultrasound is shown in the picture. What are the likely cause of this patient’s anuria and ultrasound finding? (D) Acute tubular necrosis secondary to hypovolemia (A) Heart failure secondary to overly aggressive fluid resuscitation (B) Iatrogenic injury near the suspensory ligaments (C) Prerenal azotemia secondary to excessive hemorrhage (E) Cervical cancer
Reason: The correct answer is (B) Iatrogenic injury near the suspensory ligaments because the patient underwent a supracervical hysterectomy, a procedure that can potentially lead to vascular or nerve injury in the pelvic region. This injury could disrupt the blood supply or neural control to the bladder, contributing to the observed minimal urine output and abnormal ultrasound findings.

Question: A 45-year-old woman presents to the office complaining of fatigue and unintentional weight loss. On examination, there is a palpable firm lymph node in the cervical area. Biopsy of the lymph node reveals Hodgkin’s lymphoma. The patient agrees to start the standard chemotherapy regimen. A few months later, after the completion of 3 successful courses, the patient presents with a dry cough and progressively worsening shortness of breath. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), the blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg, the pulse is 72/min, and the respirations are 16/min. Pulse oximetry shows an O2 saturation of 94% on room air. On spirometry, the patient's FEV1/FVC ratio is normal. Chest CT reveals bilateral diffuse cystic airspaces in middle and lower lung fields. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient’s current symptoms? (C) Development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (A) Drug-induced interstitial lung disease (E) Development of bacterial pneumonia due to immunocompromised state (D) Transfusion-related acute lung injury (B) Metastatic spread to the lungs
Reason: The correct answer is (A) Drug-induced interstitial lung disease because the patient has a history of receiving chemotherapy for Hodgkin’s lymphoma, which is known to cause pulmonary side effects, including interstitial lung disease. The presence of dry cough, worsening shortness of breath, and bilateral diffuse cystic airspaces on chest CT are consistent with this complication.
Answer: (A) Drug-induced interstitial lung disease

Question: A 55-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department by her husband because of chest pain and a cough productive of blood-tinged sputum that started 1 hour ago. Two days ago, she returned from a trip to China. She has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for 35 years. Her only home medication is oral hormone replacement therapy for postmenopausal hot flashes. Her pulse is 123/min and blood pressure is 91/55 mm Hg. Physical examination shows distended neck veins. An ECG shows sinus tachycardia, a right bundle branch block, and T-wave inversion in leads V5–V6. Despite appropriate lifesaving measures, the patient dies. Examination of the lung on autopsy shows a large, acute thrombus in the right pulmonary artery. Based on the autopsy findings, which of the following is the most likely origin of the thrombus? (B) Iliac vein (E) Renal vein (D) Subclavian vein (A) Posterior tibial vein (C) Great saphenous vein
Reason: The most likely origin of the thrombus is the iliac vein because deep vein thrombosis (DVT) often arises from the veins in the pelvis and thighs, particularly the iliac veins. Given the patient's risk factors, such as recent travel (which can lead to prolonged immobility) and smoking, these contributors increase the likelihood of thrombus formation in the deep venous system, often leading to pulmonary embolism.
Answer: (B) Iliac vein

Question: A 43-year-old Hispanic woman was admitted to the emergency room with intermittent sharp and dull pain in the right lower quadrant for the past 2 days. The patient denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or fever. She states that she was ‘completely normal’ prior to this sudden episode of pain. The patient states that she is sure she is not currently pregnant and notes that she has no children. Physical exam revealed guarding on palpation of the lower quadrants. An abdominal ultrasound revealed free abdominal fluid, as well as fluid in the gallbladder fossa. After further evaluation, the patient is considered a candidate for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The procedure and the risks of surgery are explained to her and she provides informed consent to undergo the cholecystectomy. During the procedure, the surgeon discovers a gastric mass suspicious for carcinoma. The surgeon considers taking a biopsy of the mass to determine whether or not she should resect the mass if it proves to be malignant. Which of the following is the most appropriate course of action to take with regards to taking a biopsy of the gastric mass? (E) The surgeon should contact an attorney to obtain consent to biopsy the mass (D) The surgeon should contact an ethics committee to obtain consent to biopsy the mass (A) The surgeon should biopsy the gastric mass (C) The surgeon should obtain consent to biopsy the mass from the patient when she wakes up from cholecystectomy (B) The surgeon should resect the gastric mass
Reason: The most appropriate course of action is for the surgeon to obtain consent to biopsy the mass from the patient when she wakes up from the cholecystectomy because informed consent is a cornerstone of medical ethics and legal practice. Since the original consent was obtained solely for the laparoscopic cholecystectomy, the patient must be informed and give explicit consent for any additional procedures, such as a biopsy of the gastric mass, ensuring that she understands the implications and risks associated with this new intervention.
Answer: (C) The surgeon should obtain consent to biopsy the mass from the patient when she wakes up from cholecystectomy

Question: A mother brings her 10 month-old boy to the pediatrician for a check-up. His birth was without complications and his development to-date has been progressing normally. He currently crawls, pulls himself up to standing, says 'mama' and 'dada' nonspecifically, and responds when called by his name. However, his mother is concerned, as she has noted over the past several weeks that he has periods where he stops breathing when he gets frightened or upset. These episodes last for 20-30 seconds and are accompanied by his lips and face become bluish. His breathing has always resumed normally within 45 seconds after the start of the episode, and he acts normally afterwards. One instance resulted in the child passing out for a 5-10 seconds before a spontaneous recovery. Which of the following is the most appropriate management of this patient's condition? (D) Basic metabolic panel (C) Electroencephalogram (E) Lung spirometry (B) Echocardiogram (A) Education and reassurance of the mother
Reason: The most appropriate management of this patient's condition is education and reassurance of the mother because the described episodes are consistent with a common phenomenon known as breath-holding spells, which often occur in young children and are usually benign. Providing reassurance helps alleviate the mother's concerns and informs her that these episodes are typically self-limiting and do not pose a significant risk of underlying disease or lasting effects.

Question: A 58-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer, coronary artery disease, gastroesophageal reflux, and diabetes mellitus is diagnosed with angiosarcoma. Which of the following most likely predisposed her to this condition? (E) Hereditary disorder (C) History of chemotherapy (A) Inherited dysfunction of a DNA repair protein (D) History of mastectomy with lymph node dissection (B) History of exposure to asbestos
Reason: The answer is (D) History of mastectomy with lymph node dissection because surgical procedures such as mastectomy, particularly with lymph node removal, can result in changes in tissue and immune function that may predispose a patient to develop secondary malignancies like angiosarcoma. Additionally, the tissue trauma and changes in vascularity after such surgeries can create an environment conducive to tumor development.

Question: A 43-year-old man presents to the emergency department with nausea and vomiting. He says symptoms onset 4 hours ago and is progressively worsening. He denies any hematemesis. Past medical history is significant for a recent negative screening colonoscopy that was performed due to a family history of colon cancer. His vital signs are significant for a temperature of 39.5°C (103.1°F). Physical examination is unremarkable. A contrast CT of the abdomen reveals a colonic perforation. Laboratory findings are significant for an elevated WBC count with a predominant left shift, a decreased platelet count, increased PT and PTT, slightly decreased hemoglobin/hematocrit, and prolonged bleeding time. Which of the following is most closely related to this patient’s prolonged bleeding time? (B) Vitamin K (A) GpIIb/IIIa (D) COX-1 and COX-2 (C) Fibrinogen (E) Giant platelets
Reason: The answer is (C) Fibrinogen because prolonged bleeding time can be associated with a deficiency or dysfunction in components of the coagulation cascade, including fibrinogen, which is essential for normal platelet aggregation and blood clot formation. In this case, the patient's colonic perforation and associated laboratory findings suggest a disruption in hemostasis, which can be linked to abnormal fibrinogen levels or function in the context of acute illness or inflammation.

Question: A 3-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of recurrent nosebleeds and fatigue for the past 2 months. He also frequently complains his head hurts. The patient has met all motoric milestones for his age but does not like to run because his legs start to hurt if he does. He is at the 40th percentile for both height and weight. His temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 125/min, respirations are 32/min, and blood pressure in the right arm is 130/85 mm Hg. A grade 2/6 systolic murmur is heard in the left paravertebral region. Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following findings? (B) Interarm difference in tissue oxygenation (E) Delayed pulse in lower extremities (A) Inferior rib notching (D) Left-axis deviation on ECG (C) Pulmonary valve stenosis
Reason: The answer is (E) Delayed pulse in lower extremities because the symptoms and blood pressure readings indicate possible coarctation of the aorta, which often leads to hypertension in the upper body and reduced or delayed pulses in the lower extremities due to compromised blood flow. The child's presentation of recurrent nosebleeds, fatigue, headaches, and the systolic murmur suggest increased collateral circulation or differential blood flow, which would be consistent with this condition.
Answer: (E) Delayed pulse in lower extremities

Question: A 45-year-old man comes to the physician because of a productive cough and dyspnea. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 15 years. His temperature is 38.8°C (102°F). Physical examination shows decreased breath sounds and dullness on percussion above the right lower lobe. An x-ray of the chest shows a right lower lobe density and a small amount of fluid in the right pleural space. The patient's symptoms improve with antibiotic treatment, but he develops right-sided chest pain one week later. Pulmonary examination shows new scratchy, high-pitched breath sounds on auscultation of the right lobe. Histologic examination of a pleural biopsy specimen is most likely to show which of the following findings? (D) Epithelioid infiltrate with central necrosis (C) Dense bacterial infiltrate (E) Red blood cell infiltrate (B) Fibrin-rich infiltrate (A) Cholesterol-rich infiltrate
Reason: The answer is (B) Fibrin-rich infiltrate because the symptoms described suggest a complicated parapneumonic effusion or empyema, which often involves fibrinous inflammation in the pleural space. This inflammatory response typically includes the accumulation of fibrin in the pleural fluid, leading to the organization of the effusion and potentially resulting in a thickened pleura with fibrin deposits.

Question: A 37-year-old woman, gravida 3, para 2, at 35 weeks' gestation is brought to the emergency department for the evaluation of lower abdominal and back pain and vaginal bleeding that started one hour ago. She has had no prenatal care. Her first two pregnancies were uncomplicated and her children were delivered vaginally. The patient smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 20 years; she reduced to half a pack every 2 days during her pregnancies. Her pulse is 80/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg. The uterus is tender, and regular hypertonic contractions are felt every 2 minutes. There is dark blood on the vulva, the introitus, and on the medial aspect of both thighs bilaterally. The fetus is in a cephalic presentation. The fetal heart rate is 158/min and reactive with no decelerations. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? (C) Elective cesarean delivery (D) Administration of betamethasone (A) Transvaginal ultrasonography (E) Administration of terbutaline (B) Vaginal delivery
Reason: The answer is (B) Vaginal delivery because the clinical presentation indicates that the patient is experiencing contractions and is in active labor, with a reactive fetal heart rate suggesting that the fetus is not in distress. Given that the cervix is likely dilating and the fetus is in a cephalic position, vaginal delivery is typically the preferred method unless there are specific contraindications. Additionally, the presence of dark blood may suggest a potential placental issue, but as long as the fetal heart rate remains stable, vaginal delivery is generally a safe option.

He denies having fever or abdominal pain and states that his diarrhea has been getting worse despite the use of over-the-counter loperamide and bismuth compounds. Upon further questioning, he recalls having multiple episodes of a burning sensation in his neck and upper chest, associated with redness and flushing of his face, which lasted for a few seconds. Because of his hypertension and dyslipidemia, the man is taking amlodipine and following a low-calorie diet. Physical examination shows that the blood pressure is 129/89 mm Hg, the pulse rate is 78/min, the respiratory rate is 14/min, and the temperature is 36.6°C (98.0°F). His abdomen is lax with no tenderness or rigidity, and rectal examination shows no blood in the rectal vault. Cardiac auscultation reveals a 3/6 holosystolic murmur in the tricuspid area, which increases in intensity with inspiration. Altered metabolism of which of the following amino acids is most likely the explanation for this patient’s presentation? (B) Tryptophan (A) Phenylalanine (C) Homocysteine (D) Arginine (E) Glycine
Reason: The answer is (B) Tryptophan because the symptoms exhibited by the patient, notably the episodes of flushing, diarrhea, and the presence of a cardiac murmur, suggest the possibility of a carcinoid syndrome, which is often associated with the increased secretion of serotonin derived from tryptophan metabolism. In such cases, excessive serotonin leads to gastrointestinal symptoms (like diarrhea), flushing, and sometimes cardiac findings, particularly affecting the right side of the heart, which corresponds to his murmur.
Answer: (B) Tryptophan
[INFO] Sampling path 10 completed.
[INFO] Opinion paths:
Path 1: To arrive at the answer, we need to analyze the scenario presented. The patient is experiencing sudden changes in behavior such as increased talkativeness, grandiosity, and agitation, which are suggestive of a manic episode or possibly a hypomanic episode, particularly given the auditory hallucinations. 

In terms of prognosis in mood disorders, particularly bipolar disorder (which can include manic episodes), the following factors can influence the prognosis:

- **Negative symptoms**: Generally associated with worse outcomes in schizophrenia, not mood disorders.
- **Male sex**: While there are gender differences in the prevalence and presentation of some psychiatric disorders, being male is not typically a predictor of prognosis.
- **Being single**: Social support is generally correlated with better outcomes in psychiatric conditions, thus being single may not be a favorable factor.
- **Affective symptoms**: Affective symptoms (e.g., mood disturbance) can suggest a mood disorder, and their presence can be a sign of a more favorable prognosis in bipolar disorder if they are present in a manic episode.
- **Slow onset**: Generally, a more gradual onset of symptoms can be associated with a worse prognosis, while a more acute onset can often be associated with a better prognosis.

Given this information, the presence of **affective symptoms** (A) is considered a predictor of good prognosis in mood disorders, as they may indicate that the patient is experiencing a more typical mood episode rather than a chronic psychotic disorder.

Therefore, the answer is:
**Answer: (A) Affective symptoms**.
Path 2: To determine the best answer, let's analyze the information provided.

The patient appears to be experiencing a sudden change in behavior, which includes signs of a manic episode (increased talkativeness, grandiosity, agitation) and possible psychosis (auditory hallucinations). This presentation may suggest a mood disorder, potentially bipolar disorder with a manic episode or a psychotic disorder.

In terms of prognosis in such conditions, several factors can influence the outcome. Generally, the following characteristics are considered:

- **Negative symptoms** (E) are often associated with worse prognosis, especially in schizophrenia.
- **Male sex** (D) is not typically a predictor of prognosis in this context.
- **Being single** (C) can correlate with poorer social support, which is generally associated with worse outcomes.
- **Affective symptoms** (A) can predict better outcomes in mood disorders because they are often more responsive to treatment.
- **Slow onset** (B) is usually associated with a worse prognosis in psychotic disorders.

Given the context of this patient's presentation, the presence of affective symptoms (such as mood elevation and increased energy) is generally associated with a better prognosis, especially in the context of bipolar disorder.

Thus, the best answer is:

**Answer: (A) Affective symptoms**
Path 3: Let's analyze the information provided step by step.

The patient exhibits signs of a possible manic episode, with symptoms such as increased talkativeness, grandiosity, agitation, and possibly hallucinations. This presentation could suggest a manic episode in the context of bipolar disorder or a primary psychotic disorder, but the sudden change in behavior and increased sociability may indicate a manic episode.

In terms of prognosis for psychiatric conditions, certain factors can be predictors of a better outcome. 

1. **Negative symptoms** (E) are generally associated with poorer prognosis in disorders such as schizophrenia, as they reflect a lack of normal emotional responses and functional abilities.
2. **Male sex** (D) does not inherently predict better or worse outcomes; outcomes can vary widely regardless of sex.
3. **Being single** (C) is often associated with poorer outcomes in some studies, particularly in schizophrenia, as it may relate to social isolation.
4. **Affective symptoms** (A) in the context of a mood disorder often predict a better prognosis, especially if the manic episode is short-lived or if there are clear mood symptoms present.
5. **Slow onset** (B) of symptoms is generally associated with a worse prognosis, particularly in psychotic disorders, as it may indicate a chronic illness.

Given these considerations, the presence of **affective symptoms** (A) in this patient is the most favorable predictor of prognosis. Affective symptoms indicate that the patient is experiencing a mood disorder, which often has a better prognosis compared to disorders with predominant negative symptoms or those with a slow onset.

Therefore, the answer is: **(A) Affective symptoms**.
Path 4: To assess the prognosis of a patient with psychiatric symptoms, especially one presenting with features consistent with a potential manic episode or psychosis, we can consider the known factors that influence prognosis in such conditions.

Let's analyze the options step by step:

- (E) Negative symptoms: Negative symptoms (such as flat affect, anhedonia, and social withdrawal) are typically associated with a poorer prognosis in schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders.
  
- (D) Male sex: Generally, male sex is associated with an earlier onset of schizophrenia and often a worse prognosis, so this is not a predictor of good prognosis.

- (C) Being single: Being single is often related to a worse prognosis in schizophrenia, as social support can be a protective factor.

- (A) Affective symptoms: The presence of affective symptoms (e.g., mood disturbances) can be associated with a better prognosis, especially if these symptoms are prominent and the individual is experiencing mania rather than schizophrenia.

- (B) Slow onset: A slow onset of symptoms often correlates with a poorer prognosis, as it can indicate a more chronic course of the illness.

Given this analysis, the best predictor of a good prognosis for this patient, who appears to be experiencing a sudden change in behavior with manic-like symptoms, would be:

**Answer: (A) Affective symptoms**
Path 5: Let's analyze the patient's presentation step by step. 

The 29-year-old man shows signs of a possible manic episode, characterized by increased talkativeness, grandiosity (boasting highly of himself), increased goal-directed activities (attending local council meetings), and agitation when his suggestions are not accepted. This presentation is suggestive of a bipolar disorder or a primary manic episode. 

In terms of prognosis, certain factors are known to correlate with a better outcome in mood disorders. Among the options given:

- **Negative symptoms** (E) typically correlate with a poorer prognosis in conditions like schizophrenia.
- **Male sex** (D) is not necessarily a predictor of prognosis; both genders can experience mood disorders.
- **Being single** (C) generally correlates with a poorer prognosis in mood disorders.
- **Affective symptoms** (A), such as those seen in mood disorders, often indicate a more favorable prognosis compared to other symptoms like psychotic features.
- **Slow onset** (B) usually correlates with a poorer prognosis, as a more gradual onset can indicate a more chronic condition.

Given this analysis, the presence of **affective symptoms** (A) is associated with a better prognosis in the context of mood disorders. Therefore, the answer is:

**Answer: (A) Affective symptoms**
Path 6: To analyze the scenario step by step, we need to identify the patient’s condition based on the information provided. The patient is exhibiting signs suggestive of a manic episode, characterized by elevated mood, increased talkativeness, grandiosity, and agitation, which may indicate Bipolar Disorder. 

Now, let's evaluate the options based on predictors of good prognosis for bipolar disorder:

- (E) Negative symptoms: Negative symptoms typically indicate a poorer prognosis in psychiatric conditions, especially in schizophrenia, but they are not directly applicable here.
- (D) Male sex: Gender does not significantly influence the prognosis of bipolar disorder; both males and females can have varying outcomes.
- (C) Being single: Being single is often associated with a poorer prognosis in bipolar disorder, as social support can be crucial for recovery.
- (A) Affective symptoms: The presence of affective symptoms, such as mania or depression, can indicate a more acute episode, but they do not necessarily predict a good prognosis.
- (B) Slow onset: A slow onset of symptoms is generally associated with a poorer prognosis in psychiatric disorders, while an acute onset is often linked to a better outcome.

Considering these points, the best answer is (A) Affective symptoms. Affective symptoms (manic or depressive episodes) suggest that the patient might have a mood disorder with a potential for treatment response, which could be seen as a predictor of a better prognosis compared to other listed factors. 

Therefore, the answer is: **(A) Affective symptoms**.
Path 7: Let's analyze the scenario step by step.

The patient is exhibiting signs of a possible manic episode, characterized by grandiosity, increased talkativeness, and agitation, along with a sudden change in behavior. This presentation could suggest a primary mood disorder, such as Bipolar Disorder, particularly a manic episode.

When considering predictors of prognosis in mood disorders, the following factors are relevant:

- **Negative symptoms** (E) generally indicate a poorer prognosis, as they can be associated with more severe and persistent impairment.
  
- **Male sex** (D) does not inherently correlate with a better or worse prognosis in mood disorders universally.
  
- **Being single** (C) can also be associated with poorer outcomes due to lack of social support.
  
- **Affective symptoms** (A) can suggest a better prognosis, particularly if they are the primary symptomatology and not accompanied by psychotic features.
  
- **Slow onset** (B) is often associated with a poorer prognosis, as more gradual changes can indicate a more chronic condition.

Given the context of this patient's manic episode and the options provided, the best predictor of a good prognosis would be the presence of **affective symptoms** (A), as these tend to suggest that the patient is experiencing a more typical mood disorder and could respond well to treatment.

Therefore, the answer is:
**(A) Affective symptoms.**
Path 8: To determine the predictor of good prognosis for this patient's condition, we should consider the context of the symptoms and the diagnosis.

The patient's presentation suggests a manic episode, possibly indicating a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. In bipolar disorder, some factors can predict a better prognosis. 

1. **Negative symptoms** (E) typically are associated with a worse prognosis, especially in schizophrenia.
2. **Male sex** (D) is generally associated with a worse prognosis in bipolar disorder.
3. **Being single** (C) can indicate a poorer social support system, which can correlate with a worse prognosis.
4. **Affective symptoms** (A) are associated with better outcomes when they are present in bipolar disorder.
5. **Slow onset** (B) of symptoms is typically associated with a worse prognosis.

Considering these factors, the presence of **affective symptoms** (A) is a known predictor of better prognosis in bipolar disorder, as it indicates a mood disorder rather than a primary psychotic disorder, which tends to have poorer outcomes.

Therefore, the answer is: **(A) Affective symptoms**.
Path 9: Let's think through the details of the case presented. The 29-year-old man exhibits signs of a possible manic episode, including auditory hallucinations, a shift in behavior, increased sociability, and agitation when his suggestions are not accepted. This clinical picture suggests a diagnosis of bipolar disorder with a current manic episode.

In terms of prognosis for bipolar disorder, several factors can influence outcomes. 

- **Negative symptoms** (E) are generally associated with poorer prognosis, particularly in schizophrenia rather than bipolar disorder.
- **Male sex** (D) does not generally predict prognosis favorably in bipolar disorder.
- **Being single** (C) can be associated with poorer support systems, which can lead to worse outcomes.
- **Affective symptoms** (A), particularly if they are present, may indicate a more favorable prognosis, especially when they are prominent during a depressive episode.
- **Slow onset** (B) is usually associated with a more chronic course and may predict a poorer outcome.

Given the context, the correct answer that aligns with a better prognosis in the case of bipolar disorder is likely (A) Affective symptoms, as the presence of affective symptoms during episodes can indicate a more favorable course compared to pure manic or negative symptom presentations.

Thus, the answer is:
**(A) Affective symptoms.**
Path 10: To determine the best predictor of good prognosis for this patient’s condition, we need to analyze the options in the context of the symptoms presented.

The patient exhibits signs of a manic episode, including grandiosity (boasting highly of himself), increased talkativeness, and agitation when his suggestions are not accepted. These symptoms align with a diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder (specifically a manic episode).

In bipolar disorder, several factors can influence prognosis:

- **Negative symptoms** (E): Generally associated with schizophrenia and indicate a poorer prognosis.
- **Male sex** (D): Gender alone does not directly correlate with better or worse prognosis in bipolar disorder.
- **Being single** (C): This can be associated with a poorer prognosis, as social support can be protective.
- **Affective symptoms** (A): The presence of affective symptoms, such as depression or mania, can indicate bipolar disorder but does not alone predict a good prognosis.
- **Slow onset** (B): A slow onset of symptoms is usually associated with a poorer prognosis in conditions like schizophrenia.

Considering these factors, **Affective symptoms (A)** are often associated with a better prognosis in bipolar disorder, particularly when they are manageable and if the patient has periods of stability. Therefore, the best answer, given the context of bipolar disorder and the symptoms presented, is:

Answer: (A) Affective symptoms

Question: A 42-year-old woman is in the hospital recovering from a cholecystectomy performed 3 days ago that was complicated by cholangitis. She is being treated with IV piperacillin-tazobactam. She calls the nurse to her room because she says that her heart is racing. She also demands that someone come in to clean the pile of garbage off of the floor because it is attracting flies. Her pulse is 112/min, respiratory rate is 20/min, temperature is 38.0°C (100.4°F), and blood pressure is 150/90 mm Hg. On physical examination, the patient appears sweaty, distressed, and unable to remain still. She is oriented to person, but not place or time. Palpation of the abdomen shows no tenderness, rebound, or guarding. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient? (D) Hepatic encephalopathy (C) Delirium tremens (E) Thyroid storm (A) Acute cholangitis (B) Alcoholic hallucinosis
Reason: The symptoms presented by the patient, including tachycardia, altered mental status, sweating, and distress, are indicative of delirium tremens, especially in the context of recent hospitalization and potential history of alcohol use. The presence of agitation and disorientation, alongside a lack of abdominal tenderness, supports the diagnosis of delirium tremens, as it often occurs in patients with a history of alcohol use who suddenly reduce or stop alcohol intake.
Answer: (C) Delirium tremens

Question: A 10-day-old male infant is brought to the emergency room for abdominal distension for the past day. His mother reports that he has been refusing feeds for about 1 day and appears more lethargic than usual. While changing his diaper today, she noticed that the baby felt warm. He has about 1-2 wet diapers a day and has 1-2 seedy stools a day. The mother reports an uncomplicated vaginal delivery. His past medical history is significant for moderate respiratory distress following birth that has since resolved. His temperature is 101°F (38.3°C), blood pressure is 98/69 mmHg, pulse is 174/min, respirations are 47/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. A physical examination demonstrates a baby in moderate distress with abdominal distension. What is the best initial step in the management of this patient? (A) Cystoscopy (C) Renal ultrasound (E) Voiding cystourethrogram (B) Radionuclide scan (D) Urinary catheterization
Reason: The best initial step in the management of this patient is urinary catheterization because the infant presents with signs of potential urinary retention or obstruction, evidenced by abdominal distension and reduced urine output (only 1-2 wet diapers per day). By placing a urinary catheter, healthcare providers can assess the bladder for residual urine, relieve any obstruction, and ensure appropriate urinary drainage, which is crucial given the infant's lethargy and fever.
Answer: (D) Urinary catheterization

Question: A 3255-g (7-lb) female newborn is delivered at term. Pregnancy and delivery were uncomplicated. On the day of her birth, she is given a routine childhood vaccine that contains a noninfectious glycoprotein. This vaccine will most likely help prevent infection by which of the following pathogens? (C) Bordetella pertussis (E) Hepatitis D virus
" (D) Rotavirus (B) Poliovirus (A) Haemophilus influenzae type b
Reason: The answer provided is incorrect. The correct answer should be (A) Haemophilus influenzae type b. This is because the routine childhood vaccine given to newborns at birth that contains a noninfectious glycoprotein is typically the Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine, which is designed to prevent infections caused by this pathogen. The Hib vaccine is essential for preventing serious infections in young children, such as meningitis and pneumonia, due to Haemophilus influenzae type b.

Question: A 25-year-old woman comes to the physician because of sadness that started 6 weeks after her 9-month-old daughter was born. Since then, she has not returned to work. Her daughter usually sleeps through the night, but the patient still has difficulty staying asleep. She is easily distracted from normal daily tasks. She used to enjoy cooking, but only orders delivery or take-out now. She says that she always feels too exhausted to do so and does not feel hungry much anyway. The pregnancy of the patient's child was complicated by gestational diabetes. The child was born at 36-weeks' gestation and has had no medical issues. The patient has no contact with the child's father. She is not sexually active. She does not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. She is 157 cm (5 ft 1 in) tall and weighs 47 kg (105 lb); BMI is 20 kg/m2. Vital signs are within normal limits. She is alert and cooperative but makes little eye contact. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? (E) Normal behavior (A) Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (B) Adjustment disorder (D) Major depressive disorder (C) Depression with peripartum-onset
Reason: The most likely diagnosis is Major depressive disorder because the patient exhibits several key symptoms typically associated with this condition, including persistent sadness, anhedonia (loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities), significant weight change (loss of appetite), sleep disturbances, and difficulty with daily tasks. These symptoms appear to have developed following the birth of her child and are causing significant impairment in her functioning, fulfilling the criteria for a major depressive episode.

Question: A 3-year-old child is brought to the pediatrician by his mother who states that he has been fussy for the past two days. She says that he has had a runny nose, a cough, a sore throat, and decreased appetite. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical exam reveals a slightly erythematous oropharynx and clear nasal discharge. The mother states that she is a single mother working at a busy law firm. The mother demands that the child receive antibiotics, as her babysitter refuses to care for the child unless he is treated with antibiotics. You diagnose the child with the common cold and inform the mother that antibiotics are not indicated. She is infuriated and accuses you of refusing to treat her child appropriately. How should you respond? (D) Explain the reasoning as to why antibiotics are not indicated for the common cold (A) Prescribe antibiotics to the child (E) Ask the mother to leave immediately (B) Refer the mother to a nearby physician who will prescribe antibiotics (C) Prescribe a placebo
Reason: The appropriate response is to explain the reasoning as to why antibiotics are not indicated for the common cold because this approach provides the mother with education on the nature of viral infections and helps her understand that antibiotics are ineffective against viruses. By taking the time to explain, the physician can help alleviate concerns, establish trust, and encourage informed decision-making about her child's healthcare.

Question: A 21-year-old medical student is studying different types of necrosis and tissue injuries. In the pathology laboratory, he observes different dead tissues under the microscope and notices the changes that are occurring as a function of time. After serial observations, he deduced that coagulation necrosis is...? (D) Characteristic of brain ischemia (B) The result of hydrolytic enzymes (A) The result of denaturation of glucose (E) Commonly associated with acute pancreatic necrosis (C) Characterized by the preservation of cellular shape
Reason: Coagulation necrosis is characterized by the preservation of cellular shape because, during this process, proteins are denatured, leading to an overall firm texture of the tissue while cellular outlines remain visible. This phenomenon contrasts with other types of necrosis, such as liquefactive necrosis, where the architecture of the tissue is lost, making the distinction important for diagnostic purposes.
Answer: (C) Characterized by the preservation of cellular shape

Question: A 26-year-old nulligravid woman presents to her gynecologist after noticing a lump in her right breast while showering. She states that she first noticed the lump approximately 2 weeks ago, when the mass was slightly tender to touch. Since then, the lump has gotten slightly smaller and is now non-tender. The patient is otherwise healthy. She does not take oral contraceptives. Her last menses was approximately 2 weeks ago. There is no family history of cancer. On exam, the patient's temperature is 98.3°F (36.8°C), blood pressure is 116/84 mmHg, pulse is 65/min, and respirations are 12/min. In her right breast, there is a small 1.5 cm mass that is mobile, well-circumscribed, and firm. Which of the following is most likely on histological examination of the mass? (A) Cysts with “leaf-like” projections (B) Dilated glands with 2 cell layers present (E) Terminal duct lobular units surrounded by dense stroma (D) Large, pleomorphic cells with associated central necrosis and microcalcifications (C) Hypercellular stroma with overgrowth of fibrous and glandular tissues
Reason: The likely histological finding of hypercellular stroma with overgrowth of fibrous and glandular tissues (C) corresponds to a fibroadenoma, which is a common benign breast tumor in young women. The patient's characteristics – a mobile, well-circumscribed, firm mass that is non-tender and has decreased in size – align with the typical presentation of a fibroadenoma, which often exhibits such histological features.

Question: A 36-year-old man presents to his primary care physician because of shortness of breath. He is an office worker who has a mostly sedentary lifestyle; however, he has noticed that recently he feels tired and short of breath when going on long walks with his wife. He also has had a hacking cough that seems to linger, though he attributes this to an upper respiratory tract infection he had 2 months ago. He has diabetes that is well-controlled on metformin and has smoked 1 pack per day for 20 years. Physical exam reveals a large chested man with wheezing bilaterally and mild swelling in his legs and abdomen. The cause of this patient's abdominal and lower extremity swelling is most likely due to which of the following processes? (B) Defective protein folding (A) Damage to kidney tubules (E) Smoking associated dysfunction (C) Excessive protease activity (D) Hyperplasia of mucous glands
Reason: The choice of defective protein folding (B) as the cause of this patient's abdominal and lower extremity swelling is likely indicative of an underlying condition leading to complications in fluid regulation and edema. In patients with a history of prolonged smoking and presenting with respiratory symptoms and signs of congestion, such as wheezing and lower extremity edema, there could be a relationship to protein malnutrition or dysfunction affecting colloidal osmotic pressure, which can lead to swelling. However, generally, more common causes related to edema might include heart failure or renal issues, which would need to be considered in a clinical evaluation.
Answer: (B) Defective protein folding

Question: A 55-year-old man, who was recently diagnosed with tuberculosis, presents to his primary care provider as part of his routine follow-up visit every month. He is currently in the initial phase of anti-tubercular therapy. His personal and medical histories are relevant for multiple trips to Southeast Asia as part of volunteer activities and diabetes of 5 years duration, respectively. A physical examination is unremarkable except for a visual abnormality on a color chart; he is unable to differentiate red from green. The physician suspects the visual irregularity as a sign of toxicity due to one of the drugs in the treatment regimen. Which of the following is the mechanism by which this medication acts in the treatment of Mycobacterium tuberculosis? (D) Inhibition of protein synthesis by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit (C) Induction of free radical metabolites (A) Inhibition of mycolic acid synthesis (B) Inhibition of DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (E) Inhibition of arabinosyltransferase
Reason: The answer of inhibition of arabinosyltransferase (E) is correct as this mechanism pertains to the action of the antitubercular drug ethambutol, which is commonly used in the treatment of tuberculosis. Ethambutol specifically targets the synthesis of the mycobacterial cell wall by inhibiting arabinogalactan formation, which is crucial for the structural integrity of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis cell wall, leading to its effectiveness against the infection. Additionally, visual disturbances described in the patient, such as red-green color blindness, are known side effects associated with ethambutol toxicity.
Answer: (E) Inhibition of arabinosyltransferase

Question: A 62-year-old woman presents to her primary care provider with anal bleeding. She reports a 4-month history of intermittent anal bleeding that was initially mild but has increased in severity over the past 2 weeks. She also reports having intermittent mucoid discharge from her anus. She denies any pain with defecation but does experience occasional constipation that has been increasing in frequency over the past month. Her past medical history is notable for hypertension and breast cancer status-post-mastectomy and radiation therapy. She takes enalapril. She has a 15-pack-year smoking history and drinks 3-4 glasses of wine per week. Her temperature is 98.4°F (36.9°C), blood pressure is 135/85 mmHg, pulse is 85/min, and respirations are 18/min. On exam, she appears pale but is pleasant and conversational. Digital rectal examination reveals a small mass within the anal canal. Anoscopy demonstrates an erythematous irregular mass arising from the mucosa proximal to the dentate line. Which of the following histologic findings is most likely to be seen in this patient’s lesion? (D) Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (A) Adenocarcinoma (C) Basaloid carcinoma (B) Basal cell carcinoma (E) Squamous cell carcinoma
Reason: The answer is (C) Basaloid carcinoma, which is consistent with the presentation of an anal canal mass in a patient with a history of carcinoma and the specific characteristics noted during examination. Basaloid carcinoma typically arises in the anal region and can present as irregular masses on the mucosa, particularly in patients with risk factors such as previous malignancies.

Question: A 13-year-old boy presents to his pediatrician with a 1-day history of frothy brown urine. He says that he believes he had strep throat some weeks ago, but he was not treated with antibiotics as his parents were worried about him experiencing harmful side effects. His blood pressure is 148/96 mm Hg, heart rate is 84/min, and respiratory rate is 15/min. Laboratory analysis is notable for elevated serum creatinine, hematuria with RBC casts, and elevated urine protein without frank proteinuria. His antistreptolysin O titer is elevated, and he is subsequently diagnosed with post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN). His mother is distraught regarding the diagnosis and is wondering if this could have been prevented if he had received antibiotics. Which of the following is the most appropriate response? (C) Antibiotic therapy may decrease the risk of developing PSGN. (B) Once a patient is infected with a nephritogenic strain of group A streptococcus, the development of PSGN cannot be prevented. (E) Antibiotic therapy decreases the severity of PSGN. (D) Antibiotic therapy only prevents PSGN in immunosuppressed patients. (A) Antibiotic therapy can prevent the development of PSGN.
Reason: The answer is (B) Once a patient is infected with a nephritogenic strain of group A streptococcus, the development of PSGN cannot be prevented. This is because post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis typically occurs after infection with specific nephritogenic strains, and once the individual is infected, the risk of developing PSGN remains despite antibiotic treatment, which is more effective when used as prophylaxis to prevent initial infections rather than treating complications that have already occurred.
Answer: (B) Once a patient is infected with a nephritogenic strain of group A streptococcus, the development of PSGN cannot be prevented.

Question: A 27-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of a knife wound to his back. His pulse is 110/min, respirations are 14/min, and blood pressure is 125/78 mm Hg. Examination shows a 5-cm deep stab wound at the level of T9. He withdraws the right foot to pain but is unable to sense vibration or whether his right toe is flexed or extended. Sensation in the left leg is normal. Motor strength is 5/5 in all extremities. Rectal tone is normal. Which of the following spinal column structures was most likely affected? (D) Lateral corticospinal tract (B) Posterior spinal artery (C) Central spinal cord grey matter (A) Dorsal root (E) Artery of Adamkiewicz
Reason: The answer is (B) Posterior spinal artery, as damage resulting from the knife wound at the T9 level is likely to affect sensory modalities. The patient exhibits loss of proprioception and vibratory sense on the right side, indicating potential injury to the dorsal columns, which is perfused by the posterior spinal arteries. The intact motor function and unilateral sensory loss further support the idea that the posterior spinal artery was compromised, leading to a right-sided sensory deficit while preserving motor function.
Answer: (B) Posterior spinal artery

Question: A 48-year-old woman comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. Six months ago, she was diagnosed with overactive bladder syndrome and began treatment with oxybutynin. She continues to have involuntary loss of urine with sudden episodes of significant bladder discomfort that is only relieved by voiding. A substance is injected into the detrusor muscle to treat her symptoms. The physician informs the patient that she will have transitory relief for several months before symptoms return and will require repeated treatment. The injected substance is most likely produced by an organism with which of the following microbiological properties? (D) Gram-negative, comma-shaped rod (A) Gram-negative, encapsulated diplococcus (B) Gram-negative, aerobic coccobacillus (C) Gram-positive, club-shaped rod (E) Gram-positive, spore-forming rod
Reason: The injected substance used to treat overactive bladder symptoms in this scenario is likely botulinum toxin, which is produced by Clostridium botulinum, a Gram-positive, spore-forming rod. The transient relief of symptoms after the injection is consistent with the pharmacologic effects of botulinum toxin, which can temporarily reduce muscle contractions in the bladder by blocking neurotransmitter release.
Answer: (E) Gram-positive, spore-forming rod

Question: A 33-year-old Honduran woman presents to your clinic with shortness of breath. She reports that her symptoms have progressed over the past several months and are now impacting her quality of life because she cannot complete her usual exercise routine. She recalls "normal" childhood illnesses, including sore throats and fevers, but never required hospitalization. Vital signs are temperature 37 degrees Celsius, blood pressure 110/70 mm Hg, heart rate 109/min, respiratory rate 22/min, and oxygen saturation 98% on room air. Physical exam reveals a holosystolic, high-pitched, blowing murmur at the cardiac apex. One would expect that this murmur would also: (C) Increase with inspiration (D) Also have a mid-systolic click loudest at S2 (A) Radiate to the neck (E) Have a characteristic machine-like sound (B) Increase with squatting or handgrip
Reason: The holosystolic murmur at the cardiac apex suggests the presence of mitral regurgitation, which is often caused by structural heart changes or functional issues. Increases in venous return, such as those that occur with squatting or handgrip, elevate the left ventricular volume and pressure, leading to an increase in the intensity of the murmur, making option (B) the correct answer.
Answer: (B) Increase with squatting or handgrip

Question: A 45-year-old woman with history of systemic sclerosis presents with new onset dyspnea, which is worsened with moderate exertion. She also complains of chest pain. An ECG was obtained, and showed right-axis deviation. Chest x-ray showed right ventricle hypertrophy. Given the patient's history and presentation, right heart catheterization was performed, which confirmed the suspected diagnosis of pulmonary artery hypertension. It is decided to start the patient on bosentan. Which of the following describes the method of action of bosentan? (C) Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor (B) Endothelin receptor agonist (A) Endothelin receptor antagonist (D) Calcium channel blocker (E) Anticoagulant
Reason: Bosentan is classified as an endothelin receptor antagonist, which means it works by blocking the action of endothelin, a potent vasoconstrictor. By inhibiting this receptor, bosentan decreases vascular resistance in the pulmonary and systemic arterial circulations, ultimately helping to improve symptoms in patients with pulmonary artery hypertension, such as the one presented in the question.
Answer: (A) Endothelin receptor antagonist

Question: A 33-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician for non-bloody nipple discharge. She states that it has been going on for the past month and that it sometimes soils her shirt. The patient drinks 2 to 3 alcoholic beverages per day and smokes 1 pack of cigarettes per day. She is currently seeking mental health treatment with an outpatient psychiatrist after a recent hospitalization for auditory hallucinations. Her psychiatrist prescribed her a medication that she can not recall. Otherwise, she complains of headaches that occur frequently. Her temperature is 98.6°F (37.0°C), blood pressure is 137/68 mmHg, pulse is 70/min, respirations are 13/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for bilateral galactorrhea that can be expressed with palpation. Which of the following is the best next step in management? (B) Discontinuation of current psychiatric medications (C) Mammography (D) TSH level (A) CT scan of the head (E) Ultrasound and biopsy
Reason: The answer to the question is (D) TSH level. The patient’s symptoms of bilateral galactorrhea and her psychiatric history suggest the possibility of hyperprolactinemia, which can be caused by various factors including medications, pituitary disorders, or thyroid dysfunction. Measuring the TSH level is an important step to rule out thyroid issues, such as hypothyroidism, that can contribute to elevated prolactin levels and galactorrhea.
Answer: (D) TSH level

Question: A pathologist receives a skin biopsy specimen from a patient who is suspected to have developed graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) following allogeneic stem-cell transplantation. The treating physician informs the pathologist that he is specifically concerned about the diagnosis as the patient developed skin lesions on the 90th-day post-transplantation and therefore, by definition, it should be considered a case of acute GVHD. However, the lesions clinically appear like those of chronic GVHD. The pathologist examines the slide under the microscope and confirms the diagnosis of chronic GVHD. Which of the following findings on skin biopsy is most likely to have helped the pathologist to confirm the diagnosis? (E) Complete separation of the dermis and epidermis (C) Hypergranulosis (B) Diffuse vacuolization in the basal cell layer (A) Focal vacuolization in the basal cell layer (D) Lymphocytic infiltration of the superficial dermis
Reason: The answer to the question is (C) Hypergranulosis. In chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), skin biopsy findings often include hypergranulosis, which is thickening of the stratum granulosum layer of the epidermis. This finding, along with changes such as lichenoid tissue damage and variable inflammation, helps differentiate chronic GVHD from the acute form, which typically shows more pronounced inflammation and less keratinocyte alteration.
Answer: (C) Hypergranulosis

Question: A 25-year-old woman first presented to your clinic due to morning stiffness, symmetrical arthralgia in her wrist joints, and fatigue. She had a blood pressure of 132/74 mm Hg and heart rate of 84/min. Physical examination revealed tenderness to palpation of both wrists but full range of motion. Anti-citrullinated protein antibodies were positive and ESR was above normal ranges. She was started on methotrexate therapy. She returns for follow up 2 months later and is found to have megaloblastic anemia. What is the mechanism of action of methotrexate? (D) Inhibits vitamin B12 activation (B) Elevates methylmalonic acid levels (C) Intercalates into strands of DNA (E) Inhibits dihydrofolate reductase (A) Elevates tetrahydrofolate levels
Reason: Methotrexate is a folate antagonist that specifically inhibits the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase, which is crucial for the conversion of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate, a form of folate essential for DNA synthesis and cell division. This mechanism explains its effectiveness as a treatment for conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis but also leads to side effects like megaloblastic anemia due to impaired DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, including those in the bone marrow.

Question: A 52-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of worsening chest pain and breathlessness during exercise. She has no history of serious illness and takes no medications. Vital signs are within normal limits. Auscultation of the chest shows a murmur in the 2nd right intercostal space. A phonocardiogram of the murmur is shown. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms? (E) Viridans group streptococci infection (B) Congenital leaflet fusion (D) Sterile platelet thrombi formation (C) Cystic medial necrosis (A) Metastatic valvular calcification
Reason: The patient's symptoms of worsening chest pain and breathlessness during exercise, along with the location of the murmur in the 2nd right intercostal space, suggest aortic stenosis, which is often caused by congenital anomalies such as the fusion of the aortic valve leaflets. Congenital leaflet fusion leads to a narrowed outflow tract, resulting in the characteristic symptoms of exertional dyspnea and chest pain due to reduced cardiac output and increased workload on the heart.

Question: A 37-year-old female presents to the emergency room complaining of headaches and palpitations. She reports that she initially started experiencing these symptoms several months prior but attributed them to stress at work. The symptoms occur episodically. Her family history is notable for medullary thyroid cancer and hyperparathyroidism. Her temperature is 98.6°F (37°C), blood pressure is 165/90 mmHg, pulse is 105/min, and respirations are 18/min. On examination she appears tremulous. Urine metanephrines are elevated. Which of the following is the most appropriate first medication in the management of this patient’s condition? (D) Tamsulosin (C) Phentolamine (A) Phenoxybenzamine (B) Propranolol (E) Atenolol
Reason: The patient's symptoms and elevated urine metanephrines suggest a diagnosis of pheochromocytoma, which leads to episodes of catecholamine release resulting in hypertension and palpitations. The appropriate first-line medication for managing this condition is phenoxybenzamine, which is a non-selective irreversible alpha-adrenergic antagonist; it effectively prevents the effects of excess catecholamines, thereby reducing hypertension and associated symptoms before surgical intervention.

Question: A 3-year-old boy is brought to the physician for a well-child examination. He has had multiple falls while walking and running for the past 4 months. He used to be able to climb stairs independently but now requires assistance. He started speaking in 2-word sentences at 2 years of age. He is at the 50th percentile for height and the 60th percentile for weight. Examination shows a waddling gait and enlargement of bilateral calves. Muscle strength is decreased in the bilateral lower extremities. Patellar and ankle reflexes are 1+ bilaterally. To rise from a sitting position, he uses his hands to support himself to an upright position. Diagnosis is confirmed by a muscle biopsy and immunohistochemistry. Which of the following is most likely responsible for the most severe clinical presentation of this disease? (C) Missense mutation (B) Silent mutation (E) Frameshift mutation (D) Splice site mutation (A) Same sense mutation
Reason: The answer is (E) Frameshift mutation because frameshift mutations typically lead to a significant alteration in the protein's coding sequence, resulting in nonfunctional proteins or truncated proteins. In the context of muscular dystrophies such as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, frameshift mutations in the dystrophin gene can lead to the most severe forms of muscle weakness and wasting, which aligns with the clinical presentation described in this case.

Question: A 31-year-old woman gives birth to a boy in the labor and delivery ward of the local hospital. The child is immediately assessed and found to be crying vigorously. He is pink in appearance with blue extremities that appear to be flexed. Inducing some discomfort shows that both his arms and legs move slightly but remain largely flexed throughout. His pulse is found to be 128 beats per minute. What is the most likely APGAR score for this newborn at this time? (D) 8 (C) 7 (B) 6 (A) 5 (E) 9
Reason: The answer is (C) 7 because the APGAR score assesses five criteria: appearance (color), pulse, grimace response, activity, and respiration. In this case, the newborn is crying vigorously (indicating good respiratory effort), has a heart rate of 128 beats per minute (which gives 2 points for pulse), shows some movement but is largely flexed (receiving 1 point for activity), and is pink with blue extremities (which gives 1 point for color). If we assume he had a grimace response of 1 point (for slight movement in response to discomfort), the total would be 7 points.

Question: An 18-month-old boy is brought in by his parents for a routine check-up. The parents state that the patient still has not had any language development, and they are concerned about developmental delay. Of note, they have also noticed that the patient’s facial features have changed significantly in the last year. The patient also seems to have trouble visually focusing on objects or on the television. On exam, the patient's temperature is 98.2°F (36.8°C), blood pressure is 108/72 mmHg, pulse is 86/min, and respirations are 14/min. Of interest, the patient has not increased much in length or weight in the past 3 months. He is now in the 25th percentile for weight but is in the 90th percentile for head circumference. The patient does not appear to have any gross or fine motor deficiencies. Of note, he has coarse facial features that were not previously noted, including a long face, prominent forehead, and protruding eyes. The patient has corneal clouding bilaterally. At rest, the patient keeps his mouth hanging open. After extensive workup, the patient is found to have 2 mutated copies of the IDUA gene, with no production of the protein iduronidase. Which of the following is the likely mutation found in this disease? (E) Silent mutation (A) Chromosomal translocation (D) Nonsense mutation (B) Interstitial deletion (C) Missense mutation
Reason: The answer to the question is (D) Nonsense mutation, as this type of mutation results in a premature stop codon, leading to a truncated protein that cannot perform its necessary function. In this case, the patient has a deficiency in the enzyme iduronidase due to mutations in the IDUA gene, and a nonsense mutation would explain the complete lack of functional protein, correlating with the severe clinical manifestations observed in conditions like mucopolysaccharidosis, specifically Hurler syndrome.

Question: A 7-year-old boy is brought to the physician for a follow-up examination after the removal of a tooth. During the procedure, he had prolonged bleeding that did not resolve with pressure and gauze packing and eventually required suture placement. His older brother had a similar episode a year ago, but his parents and two sisters have never had problems with prolonged bleeding. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Genetic analysis confirms an X-linked recessive disorder. Which of the following is most likely deficient in this patient? (C) Factor XI (D) Protein C (E) Factor IX (A) Factor VIII (B) Von Willebrand factor
Reason: The answer to the question is (A) Factor VIII, as this factor is deficient in hemophilia A, an X-linked recessive bleeding disorder that leads to prolonged bleeding due to impaired clotting. The fact that the boy's older brother experienced a similar bleeding issue, along with the confirmation of an X-linked recessive disorder through genetic analysis, supports the diagnosis of hemophilia A, which is caused by a deficiency of Factor VIII.

[INFO] Opinion paths:
Path 1: Let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. **Patient Profile**: A 26-year-old man involved in a motor vehicle accident presents with signs of shock (elevated heart rate, low blood pressure) and severe abdominal pain, particularly in the left upper quadrant.

2. **Vital Signs**: The vital signs indicate he is likely experiencing hypovolemic shock (low BP, high HR), which is concerning given the context of trauma.

3. **Physical Exam Findings**: The presence of abdominal wall rigidity, involuntary guarding, and tenderness suggests peritonitis, likely due to internal bleeding.

4. **Sonography Results**: The bedside sonography showing hemoperitoneum confirms the presence of blood within the abdominal cavity, further indicating a significant injury that may require surgical intervention.

5. **Fluid Resuscitation**: Despite administering intravenous fluids, the patient’s condition has worsened, with a further drop in blood pressure (82/50 mmHg) and an increase in heart rate (180 bpm). This indicates that he is not responding adequately to fluid resuscitation and may need surgical intervention.

6. **Next Steps in Management**: Given the evidence of hemoperitoneum and the patient's hemodynamic instability, the best next step is to promptly explore the abdomen to identify and manage any life-threatening injuries.

Therefore, the best next step in this case is (E) Exploratory laparotomy.
Path 2: Let's analyze the situation step by step.

1. **Patient Presentation**: The 26-year-old man has low blood pressure (BP 100/60 mmHg), high heart rate (HR 125 bpm, later increases to 180 bpm), and signs of significant abdominal pain with rigidity and guarding, indicating possible internal bleeding or abdominal injury.

2. **Bedside Sonography Findings**: The ultrasound shows hemoperitoneum, which suggests there is blood in the abdominal cavity, likely due to a serious injury.

3. **Vital Signs After Fluid Resuscitation**: Despite intravenous fluid administration, the patient’s blood pressure has dropped significantly (BP 82/50 mmHg), and the heart rate has increased, suggesting that he is likely in shock (possibly hemorrhagic shock due to internal bleeding).

4. **Immediate Management Needs**: Given the evidence of significant abdominal trauma, hemoperitoneum, and the patient's unstable vital signs indicating potential shock, the priority is to address the source of bleeding and stabilize the patient.

5. **Options Analysis**:
   - (B) CT abdomen and pelvis: While a CT scan can provide more detailed information, it may delay necessary surgical intervention in a patient who is unstable.
   - (E) Exploratory laparotomy: This is the most appropriate next step in this scenario. Given the signs of severe abdominal injury, hemoperitoneum, and hemodynamic instability, an exploratory laparotomy is warranted to identify and control the source of bleeding.
   - (D) Abdominal plain film: This is not the best choice in an emergency setting where immediate action is required.
   - (C) Morphine: While pain management is important, it is not the priority in this life-threatening situation.
   - (A) Normal saline bolus and re-evaluation of hemodynamics after infusion: Although fluid resuscitation is critical, the patient's worsening hemodynamics suggest that further delay for re-evaluation is not advisable.

Given the urgency of the situation, the best next step is (E) Exploratory laparotomy.
Path 3: In this clinical scenario, the patient presents with signs of significant abdominal trauma following a motor vehicle accident, including extreme abdominal pain, rigidity, guarding, and evidence of hemoperitoneum on ultrasound. His vital signs indicate hypotension (BP 82/50 mmHg) and tachycardia (HR 180 bpm), suggesting he is likely in shock.

Given the presence of hemoperitoneum and the unstable vital signs, the best next step is to perform an exploratory laparotomy (E). This is necessary to quickly assess and manage any potential intra-abdominal injuries, control bleeding, and prevent further complications. 

While normal saline bolus and re-evaluation (A) could be considered, the patient's condition appears critical, and the risks associated with waiting for further assessment outweigh the need for immediate surgical intervention. Thus, exploratory laparotomy is the most appropriate choice.

Answer: (E) Exploratory laparotomy
Path 4: Let's think through the scenario step by step:

1. **Patient Presentation:** The patient is a 26-year-old man who has experienced a motor vehicle accident and is presenting with signs of severe abdominal trauma, including extreme left upper quadrant pain, abdominal rigidity, and guarding.

2. **Vital Signs:** His vital signs are concerning: low blood pressure (100/60 mmHg initially, then 82/50 mmHg), elevated heart rate (125 bpm initially, then 180 bpm), and normal temperature and respiratory rate. This suggests he is possibly in shock.

3. **Bedside Findings:** The ultrasound shows evidence of hemoperitoneum, indicating bleeding into the abdominal cavity, which can often result from organ injury.

4. **Fluid Resuscitation:** Despite receiving intravenous fluids, his blood pressure has dropped significantly, and his heart rate has increased, indicating he is likely in hypovolemic shock.

5. **Next Steps in Management:** Given the evidence of significant abdominal injury and hemoperitoneum, and the worsening hemodynamics, immediate surgical intervention is warranted. 

**Conclusion:** In this case, the best next step in management is (E) Exploratory laparotomy. This procedure is necessary to assess for any intra-abdominal injuries that may be causing the hemoperitoneum and to control any bleeding. 

**Final Answer:** (E) Exploratory laparotomy.
Path 5: Let's evaluate the scenario step by step.

1. **Patient Presentation**: The 26-year-old man has been involved in a motor vehicle accident and presents with signs of significant abdominal distress, particularly in the left upper quadrant. He exhibits vital signs indicating possible shock (low blood pressure and high heart rate) and has physical exam findings suggestive of peritonitis (abdominal rigidity, guarding, tenderness).

2. **Diagnostic Findings**: Bedside sonography shows evidence of hemoperitoneum, which indicates bleeding into the abdominal cavity, likely from a solid organ injury (e.g., spleen, liver).

3. **Current Vital Signs**: Despite receiving intravenous fluids, his blood pressure remains low (82/50 mmHg) and heart rate is elevated (180 bpm). These signs further suggest he is in hypovolemic shock and may need immediate surgical intervention.

4. **Next Steps in Management**: Given the context of severe abdominal pain, evidence of hemoperitoneum, and signs of shock, the priority is to address the source of the bleeding. While further diagnostics like a CT scan could provide useful information, the presence of shock and the risk of life-threatening injury necessitate immediate intervention.

5. **Best Next Step**: The best next step in this situation is an exploratory laparotomy (E). This will allow for direct assessment and management of any injuries causing the hemoperitoneum.

Thus, the answer is: **(E) Exploratory laparotomy**.
Path 6: Let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. **Clinical Presentation**: The patient is a 26-year-old man involved in a motor vehicle accident, presenting with severe left upper quadrant abdominal pain, signs of abdominal rigidity, involuntary guarding, and tenderness. This is suggestive of an acute abdomen, possibly due to internal bleeding or organ injury.

2. **Vital Signs**: The patient is hypotensive (BP 82/50 mmHg) and tachycardic (HR 180 bpm), indicating shock, likely hypovolemic due to internal bleeding (hemoperitoneum).

3. **Bedside Sonography**: The presence of hemoperitoneum suggests significant intra-abdominal injury, which could be from splenic rupture or other solid organ injury.

4. **Fluid Resuscitation**: Although intravenous fluids have been administered, the patient's hemodynamics have not improved; he remains hypotensive and tachycardic.

5. **Next Steps**: Given the patient's unstable condition with signs of shock and hemoperitoneum, the best next step is surgical intervention rather than further imaging or fluid resuscitation.

**Conclusion**: The best next step in this scenario is (E) Exploratory laparotomy. This is indicated due to the high suspicion of significant intra-abdominal injury requiring surgical evaluation and possible intervention.
Path 7: Let's break down the scenario step by step.

1. **Patient Presentation**: The patient is a 26-year-old man involved in a motor vehicle accident, presenting with signs of shock (BP 100/60 mmHg and HR 125 bpm) and severe abdominal pain, particularly in the left upper quadrant. 

2. **Physical Examination Findings**: The exam shows abdominal wall rigidity, involuntary guarding, and tenderness, which are indicative of potential intra-abdominal injury. 

3. **Diagnostic Imaging**: Bedside sonography has already shown evidence of hemoperitoneum, suggesting bleeding into the abdominal cavity.

4. **Vital Signs**: Despite intravenous fluid resuscitation, the patient's blood pressure has dropped to 82/50 mmHg and heart rate has increased to 180 bpm, indicating worsening hemodynamic instability.

Given this information, the patient is likely experiencing significant intra-abdominal bleeding, possibly from a splenic laceration or other abdominal organ injury, which can lead to hemorrhagic shock.

5. **Best Next Step**: In the context of suspected intra-abdominal bleeding and the patient's hemodynamic instability, the best next step is to perform an exploratory laparotomy (Option E). This is necessary to directly assess and manage any injuries that may be causing the hemoperitoneum and to control the source of bleeding.

Therefore, the answer is:
**(E) Exploratory laparotomy**.
Path 8: Let's think through this case step by step.

The patient is a 26-year-old man who has experienced a motor vehicle accident and presents with signs of significant abdominal injury, including:

- Severe left upper quadrant pain
- Abdominal wall rigidity and guarding
- Hemodynamic instability (low blood pressure and high heart rate)
- Evidence of hemoperitoneum on ultrasound

Given these findings, this patient likely has internal bleeding due to abdominal trauma, which could be due to injuries to solid organs like the spleen or liver. The vital signs indicate that the patient is in shock (evidenced by hypotension and tachycardia) despite receiving intravenous fluids.

In this scenario, the most critical step is to address the potential for significant internal bleeding, which is likely causing the hemodynamic instability. While further imaging like a CT scan could be helpful, it is not the best immediate step when a patient is in shock and there is a clear indication of intra-abdominal bleeding.

The best next step in this case is to perform an exploratory laparotomy (Option E), as it allows for direct evaluation and intervention for any intra-abdominal injuries that may be causing the bleeding and hemodynamic instability.

Answer: (E) Exploratory laparotomy
Path 9: Let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. **Patient Presentation**: The 26-year-old man presents with extreme abdominal pain, particularly in the left upper quadrant, after a motor vehicle accident. He exhibits signs of shock (low blood pressure and high heart rate) and abdominal exam findings suggestive of peritonitis (rigidity, guarding, tenderness).

2. **Vital Signs**: His vital signs show hypotension (BP 100/60 mmHg initially, dropping to BP 82/50 mmHg) and tachycardia (HR 125 bpm initially, increasing to HR 180 bpm). This indicates he is likely in hypovolemic shock due to internal bleeding.

3. **Bedside Sonography**: The ultrasound shows evidence of hemoperitoneum, which suggests internal bleeding, likely from a splenic or hepatic injury given the left upper quadrant pain.

4. **Current Management**: The patient has received intravenous fluids but remains hypotensive and tachycardic despite this intervention.

Given that the patient is showing signs of instability and there's evidence of hemoperitoneum, the best next step is to address the potential source of bleeding urgently.

**Best Next Step**: (E) Exploratory laparotomy. 

This is indicated because the patient is likely experiencing a surgical emergency due to internal bleeding and needs immediate surgical intervention rather than further imaging or fluid resuscitation. Answer: (E) Exploratory laparotomy.
Path 10: In this scenario, the 26-year-old man presents with signs of significant abdominal trauma, including extreme abdominal pain, rigidity, guarding, and evidence of hemoperitoneum on ultrasound. His vital signs indicate hypotension (BP 82/50 mmHg) and tachycardia (HR 180 bpm), which suggests shock, likely due to internal bleeding.

Given the situation, where the patient shows signs of ongoing hemorrhagic shock and has persistent hypotension despite fluid resuscitation, the best next step is to intervene surgically. A CT scan may provide more information, but given the urgency of his condition and the presence of hemoperitoneum, immediate surgical evaluation is warranted.

Therefore, the best next step in management is:

**(E) Exploratory laparotomy**.

Question: A 72-year-old man is admitted to the hospital because of a 2-day history of right-sided weakness and dysphagia. He is diagnosed with a thrombotic stroke and treatment with aspirin is initiated. A videofluoroscopic swallowing study is performed to determine his ability to swallow safely; he is found to be at increased risk of aspiration. Consequently, he is ordered not to have any food or liquids by mouth. A Dobhoff feeding tube is placed, tube feedings are ordered, and the patient starts receiving tube feedings. Shortly after, he develops a cough and dyspnea. An x-ray of the chest shows opacification of the right lower lobe and that the end of the Dobhoff tube is in his right lung instead of his stomach. Which of the following would most likely have prevented this medical error from occurring? (D) Mortality and morbidity review (B) Closed-loop communication (E) Fishbone diagram (C) Checklist (A) Two patient identifiers
Reason: A checklist could have likely prevented this error by ensuring that every step in the placement of the Dobhoff feeding tube was followed in a systematic manner, including verifying the correct placement of the tube. Utilizing a checklist helps to minimize human error in medical procedures by prompting the healthcare team to confirm critical details before proceeding, thus reducing the risk of complications such as improper tube placement.

Question: A 1-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of irritability and poor feeding that began 2 days ago. His mother reports that he has been crying more than usual during this period. He refused to eat his breakfast that morning and has not taken in any food or water since that time. He has not vomited. When changing the boy's diapers this morning, the mother noticed his urine had a strong smell and pink color. He has not passed urine since then. He was born at term and has been healthy. He appears ill. His temperature is 36.8°C (98.2°F), pulse is 116/min, and blood pressure is 98/54 mm Hg. The boy cries when the lower abdomen is palpated. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? (E) Administer cefixime (A) Perform renal ultrasound (B) Perform voiding cystourethrogram (D) Perform transurethral catheterization (C) Obtain clean catch urine sample
Reason: Performing transurethral catheterization is the most appropriate next step in management because the child's symptoms and physical findings, including strong-smelling, pink urine and a distended bladder with absence of urine output, suggest a potential urinary tract obstruction or severe dehydration. This procedure allows for immediate drainage of the bladder and can also facilitate obtaining urine for analysis to further evaluate for infection or other underlying issues.
Answer: (D) Perform transurethral catheterization

Question: While testing various strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, a researcher discovers that a certain strain of this bacteria is unable to cause disease in mice when deposited in their lungs. What physiological test would most likely deviate from normal in this strain of bacteria as opposed to a typical strain? (A) Bile solubility (C) Quellung reaction (B) Optochin sensitivity (E) Motility (D) Hemolytic reaction when grown on sheep blood agar
Reason: The Quellung reaction is a physiological test that detects the presence of specific capsular polysaccharides in Streptococcus pneumoniae, which are crucial for its virulence. A certain strain being unable to cause disease in mice suggests that it likely has an impaired or absent capsule, leading to a negative Quellung reaction, which would deviate from typical strains that possess a virulent capsule enabling them to evade the immune response.
Answer: (C) Quellung reaction

Question: A 25 year-old woman is brought to the emergency department by her boyfriend after she cut her forearms with a knife. She has had multiple visits to the emergency department in the past few months for self-inflicted wounds. She claims that her boyfriend is the worst person in the world. She and her boyfriend have broken up 20 times in the past 6 months. She says she cut herself not because she wants to kill herself; she feels alone and empty and wants her boyfriend to take care of her. Her boyfriend claims that she is prone to outbursts of physical aggression as well as mood swings. He says that these mood swings last a few hours and vary from states of exuberance and self-confidence to states of self-doubt and melancholy. On examination, the patient appears well-dressed and calm. She has normal speech, thought processes, and thought content. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? (C) Dependent personality disorder (A) Histrionic personality disorder (B) Cyclothymic disorder (E) Borderline personality disorder (D) Bipolar II disorder
Reason: The symptoms presented by the patient, including self-harming behavior, intense and unstable interpersonal relationships (such as frequent breakups with her boyfriend), impulsivity, and mood swings, are characteristic of borderline personality disorder. This disorder often involves a pattern of emotional instability and a chronic feeling of emptiness, aligning with the patient's expressed desire for her boyfriend to care for her despite her aggressive outbursts. Hence, option (E) is the most fitting diagnosis.

Question: A 31-year-old unresponsive man is admitted to the emergency department after a single-vehicle roll-over accident. On primary assessment by paramedics, he was unresponsive. On admission, he opened his eyes to painful stimuli, was not responsive to verbal commands, his arms were flexed and the legs were straight with no reaction to pain. The patient was intubated and examined. The blood pressure is 150/90 mm Hg; the heart rate, 56/min; the respiratory rate, 14/min; the temperature, 37.5℃ (99.5℉), and the SpO2, 94% on room air. The examination shows a depressed fracture of the left temporal bone and ecchymoses and scratches over his abdomen and extremities. His pupils are round, equal, and show a poor response to light. There is no disconjugate eye deviation. His lungs are clear to auscultation and the heart sounds are normal. Abdominal examination reveals normal bowel sounds and no fluid wave. There are no meningeal signs. Focused assessment with sonography for trauma is negative for blood in the abdominal cavity. Head CT scan is shown in the picture. Which procedure is required to guide further management? (A) Lumbar puncture (E) Brain MRI (B) Placement of an intraventricular catheter (C) Placement of an arterial line (D) Diagnostic peritoneal lavage
Reason: The answer is (B) Placement of an intraventricular catheter because the patient's clinical presentation indicates a potential traumatic brain injury, likely causing increased intracranial pressure (ICP) due to the depressed skull fracture and altered level of consciousness. An intraventricular catheter can help monitor ICP and facilitate the management of any associated complications, making it a crucial procedure to guide further management in this scenario.
Answer: (B) Placement of an intraventricular catheter

Question: A 39-year-old woman presents to the clinic with complaints of constipation for the past 2 weeks. She reports that it has been getting increasingly difficult to pass stool to the point that she would go for 2-3 days without going to the bathroom. Prior to this, she passed stool every day without difficulty. She denies weight changes, headaches, chest pain, or abdominal pain but endorses fatigue. Her past medical history is significant for 2 episodes of kidney stones within the past 3 months. A physical examination is unremarkable. Laboratory studies are done and the results are shown below:

Serum:
Na+: 138 mEq/L
Cl-: 97 mEq/L
K+: 3.9 mEq/L
HCO3-: 24 mEq/L 
BUN: 10 mg/dL
Glucose: 103 mg/dL
Creatinine: 1.1 mg/dL
Thyroid-stimulating hormone: 3.1 uU/mL
Ca2+: 12.1 mg/dL
Phosphate: 1.2 mg/dL (Normal: 2.5-4.5 mg/dL)

What is the most likely explanation for this patient’s low phosphate levels? (C) Hereditary malfunction of phosphate absorption at the small brush border (D) Increase in calcium-sodium cotransporter activity at the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) (E) Inhibition of sodium-phosphate cotransporter at the proximal convoluted tubule (PCT) (B) Defective G-coupled calcium-sensing receptors in multiple tissues (A) Chronic renal disease caused by recurrent renal stones
Reason: The answer is (E) Inhibition of sodium-phosphate cotransporter at the proximal convoluted tubule (PCT) because the patient's elevated calcium levels suggest hypercalcemia, which can lead to decreased reabsorption of phosphate in the kidneys. This is primarily due to the actions of increased calcium levels affecting the transport mechanisms, specifically inhibiting the sodium-phosphate cotransporter in the PCT, resulting in low serum phosphate levels.
Answer: (E) Inhibition of sodium-phosphate cotransporter at the proximal convoluted tubule (PCT)

Question: A 59-year-old man presents to his primary care physician complaining of leg pain with exertion for the last 6 months. He has cramping in his calves when walking. He states that the cramping is worse on the right than the left and that the cramping resolves when he stops walking. He has had type 2 diabetes mellitus for 15 years and is not compliant with his medications. He has smoked 20–30 cigarettes daily for the past 30 years. On examination, the femoral pulses are diminished on both sides. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient’s condition? (B) Narrowing of the spinal canal (A) Joint degeneration (E) Segmental arterial occlusions due to non-atherosclerotic vasculitis (D) Atherosclerosis (C) Venous thrombosis
Reason: The patient's symptoms, including exertional leg pain and cramping that resolves with rest, suggest intermittent claudication, which is commonly caused by reduced blood flow due to arterial blockage. Given his medical history of type 2 diabetes and a significant smoking habit, both of which are risk factors for atherosclerosis, this condition likely leads to the narrowing of the arteries, particularly in the lower extremities, explaining his leg pain.
Answer: (D) Atherosclerosis

Question: A 3-year-old boy is brought in by his parents to the emergency department for lethargy and vomiting. The patient was fine until this afternoon, when his parents found him in the garage with an unlabeled open bottle containing an odorless liquid. On exam, the patient is not alert or oriented, but is responsive to touch and pain. The patient is afebrile and pulse is 90/min, blood pressure is 100/60 mmHg, and respirations are 20/min. Which of the following is an antidote for the most likely cause of this patient’s presentation? (D) Epinephrine (C) Succimer (E) Sodium bicarbonate (A) Glucagon (B) Fomepizole
Reason: The child's lethargy and vomiting, combined with the exposure to an unlabeled odorless liquid, raise suspicion for a toxic alcohol ingestion, such as methanol or ethylene glycol. Fomepizole is specifically indicated as an antidote in cases of overdose from these substances, as it inhibits the enzyme that converts them into their toxic metabolites, thereby mitigating their harmful effects.
Answer: (B) Fomepizole

Question: A 48-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of a 2-hour history of severe left-sided colicky flank pain that radiates towards his groin. He has vomited twice. Last year, he was treated with ibuprofen for swelling and pain of his left toe. He drinks 4-5 beers most days of the week. Examination shows left costovertebral angle tenderness. An upright x-ray of the abdomen shows no abnormalities. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis shows an 9-mm stone in the proximal ureter on the left. Which of the following is most likely to be seen on urinalysis? (C) Wedge-shaped crystals (A) Red blood cell casts (B) Rhomboid-shaped crystals (E) Hexagon-shaped crystals
" (D) Coffin-lid-like crystals
Reason: The scenario presented indicates that the patient likely has a uric acid stone, which is consistent with his history of gouty arthritis (indicated by his previous toe swelling and pain). Urinary uric acid levels can lead to the formation of crystals that appear as rhomboid-shaped on urinalysis, which would thus be a characteristic finding in this patient.

Question: A 6-year-old girl is brought to the emergency department because of right elbow swelling and pain 30 minutes after falling onto her outstretched right arm. She has been unable to move her right elbow since the fall. Physical examination shows bruising, swelling, and tenderness of the right elbow; range of motion is limited by pain. An x-ray of the right arm shows a supracondylar fracture of the humerus with anterior displacement of the proximal fragment. Further evaluation is most likely to show which of the following findings? (B) Radial deviation of the wrist (C) Atrophy of the thenar eminence (D) Inability to abduct shoulder (A) Absent distal radial pulse (E) Inability to flex the elbow
Reason: The most likely finding upon further evaluation in this case of a supracondylar humeral fracture is an absent distal radial pulse. This is because the fracture can lead to vascular compromise, particularly of the brachial artery, which can result in an impaired blood supply to the forearm and hand, causing a diminished or absent pulse distal to the injury. The anatomy and biomechanics involved in elbow fractures, especially in children, make this complication significant.
Answer: (A) Absent distal radial pulse

Question: A previously healthy 35-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of a sudden onset of difficulty breathing that began when she woke up that morning. She also reports a dry cough and chest pain that is worse with inspiration. She does not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. Her only medication is an oral contraceptive. Her temperature is 38°C (100.4°F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 120/70 mm Hg. Oxygen saturation is 93% on room air. Physical examination is unremarkable. An ECG shows non-specific ST segment changes. An x-ray of the chest shows no abnormalities. In addition to oxygen supplementation, which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? (A) Start noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (D) Perform pulmonary angiography (C) Measure fibrin degradation products (E) Order ventilation and perfusion scintigraphy (B) Administer ibuprofen
Reason: The most appropriate next step in management is to measure fibrin degradation products because the patient's sudden onset of difficulty breathing, chest pain, and the presence of risk factors suggest a possible pulmonary embolism (PE). Measuring fibrin degradation products, such as D-dimer, can help assess the likelihood of this condition, guiding further diagnostic assessments.

Question: A 50-year-old female is evaluated by her physician for recent weight gain. Physical examination is notable for truncal obesity, wasting of her distal musculature and moon facies. In addition she complains of abnormal stretch marks that surround her abdomen. The physician suspects pituitary adenoma. Which of the following high-dose dexamethasone suppression test findings and baseline ACTH findings would support his view? (B) Cortisol suppression, high baseline ACTH (C) No cortisol suppression, high baseline ACTH (E) Elevation of cortisol above pre-test levels, high baseline ACTH (D) No cortisol suppression, low baseline ACTH (A) Cortisol suppression, normal baseline ACTH
Reason: The correct answer is (B) Cortisol suppression, high baseline ACTH because in cases of pituitary adenoma, there is typically an overproduction of ACTH leading to increased cortisol levels. However, the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test can demonstrate that cortisol production is suppressed in this scenario, indicating a pituitary source of ACTH regulation, which aligns with the findings of high baseline ACTH.

Question: An investigator is studying physiologic renal responses to common medical conditions. She measures urine osmolalities in different parts of the nephron of a human subject in the emergency department. The following values are obtained:
Portion of nephron Osmolality (mOsmol/kg)
Proximal convoluted tubule 300
Loop of Henle, descending limb 1200
Loop of Henle, ascending limb 250
Distal convoluted tubule 100
Collecting duct 1200
These values were most likely obtained from an individual with which of the following condition?" (D) Furosemide overdose (B) Dehydration (C) Psychogenic polydipsia (E) Diabetes insipidus (A) Gitelman syndrome
Reason: The correct answer is (B) Dehydration because the urine osmolality values indicate a high concentration of solutes in the urine, particularly in the collecting duct (1200 mOsm/kg), which suggests that the kidneys are conserving water to compensate for a deficit due to dehydration. The high osmolality in the descending limb of the loop of Henle (1200 mOsm/kg) further supports this, reflecting the kidney’s ability to concentrate urine in response to an inadequate fluid intake or significant fluid losses.
Answer: (B) Dehydration

Question: A mother brings her 10 month-old boy to the pediatrician for a check-up. His birth was without complications and his development to-date has been progressing normally. He currently crawls, pulls himself up to standing, says 'mama' and 'dada' nonspecifically, and responds when called by his name. However, his mother is concerned, as she has noted over the past several weeks that he has periods where he stops breathing when he gets frightened or upset. These episodes last for 20-30 seconds and are accompanied by his lips and face become bluish. His breathing has always resumed normally within 45 seconds after the start of the episode, and he acts normally afterwards. One instance resulted in the child passing out for a 5-10 seconds before a spontaneous recovery. Which of the following is the most appropriate management of this patient's condition? (B) Echocardiogram (D) Basic metabolic panel (E) Lung spirometry (A) Education and reassurance of the mother (C) Electroencephalogram
Reason: Education and reassurance of the mother is the most appropriate management in this case as the child's episodes are indicative of breath-holding spells, which are common and typically benign in infants and toddlers. Providing reassurance can help alleviate the mother's concerns about the child's distress during these episodes, as they are not harmful and usually resolve as the child grows older.

Question: A 70-year-old man presents to a physician with a cough and difficulty breathing during the last 7 years. He has smoked since his teenage years and regularly inhales tiotropium, formoterol, and budesonide and takes oral theophylline. The number of exacerbations has been increasing over the last 6 months. His temperature is 37.2°C (99°F), the heart rate is 92/min, the blood pressure is 134/88 mm Hg and the respiratory rate is 26/min. On chest auscultation breath sounds are diffusely decreased and bilateral rhonchi are present. Pulse oximetry shows his resting oxygen saturation to be 88%. Chest radiogram shows a flattened diaphragm, hyperlucency of the lungs, and a long, narrow heart shadow. The physician explains this condition to the patient and emphasizes the importance of smoking cessation. In addition to this, which of the following is most likely to reduce the risk of mortality from the condition? (C) Roflumilast (D) Pulmonary rehabilitation (A) Low-dose oral prednisone (E) Supplemental oxygen (B) Prophylactic azithromycin
Reason: Supplemental oxygen is likely to reduce the risk of mortality in this patient because it addresses the significant hypoxemia indicated by the low resting oxygen saturation of 88%. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients with low oxygen levels benefit from supplemental oxygen, as it can improve survival rates and alleviate symptoms related to chronic respiratory failure.
Answer: (E) Supplemental oxygen

Question: A 3-week-old boy has non-bilious projectile vomiting that occurred after feeding. After vomiting, the infant is still hungry. The infant appears dehydrated and malnourished. A firm, “olive-like” mass of about 1.5 cm in diameter is palpated in the right upper quadrant, by the lateral edge of the rectus abdominus muscle. On laboratory testing, the infant is found to have a hypochloremic, hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis. Which of the following is most likely the cause of this patient’s symptoms? (D) Aganglionic colon segment (A) Intussusception (E) Achalasia (B) Duodenal atresia (C) Hypertrophy of the pylorus muscle
Reason: The patient's symptoms, including non-bilious projectile vomiting after feedings, persistent hunger, dehydration, the presence of an "olive-like" mass in the right upper quadrant, and the laboratory findings of hypochloremic, hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis, are classic signs of hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. This condition occurs due to abnormal thickening of the pylorus muscle, which obstructs gastric outflow and leads to the described symptoms and laboratory abnormalities commonly seen in infants.
Answer: (C) Hypertrophy of the pylorus muscle

Question: A 65-year-old woman comes to the physician because of increased difficulty hearing. She has also had dull and progressive pain in her hip and lower back for the past 2 months that is worse with exertion. Examination of the ears shows impaired hearing on the left with whispered voice test and lateralization to the right with Weber testing. There is localized tenderness over the right hip and groin area with decreased range of motion of the hip. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Serum studies show:
Total protein 6.5 g/dL
Alkaline phosphatase 950 U/L
Calcium 9 mg/dL
Phosphorus 4 mg/dL
Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's symptoms?" (C) Defective bone matrix mineralization (D) Increased rate of bone remodeling (E) Metastatic destruction of the bone (B) Decreased bone mass with microarchitectural disruption (A) Proliferation of plasma cells in the bone marrow
Reason: The patient's symptoms, including increased hearing difficulty, hip pain, elevated alkaline phosphatase levels, and the age group, suggest the presence of Paget's disease of bone, which is characterized by an increased rate of bone remodeling. This condition leads to abnormalities in bone formation and resorption, resulting in the symptoms of pain, hearing changes due to skull involvement, and elevated alkaline phosphatase as a marker of increased osteoblastic activity associated with the increased remodeling.
Answer: (D) Increased rate of bone remodeling

Question: A 7-month-old Caucasian male presents with recurrent sinusitis and pharyngitis. The parents say that the child has had these symptoms multiple times in the past couple of months and a throat swab sample reveals the presence of Streptoccocus pneumoniae. Upon workup for immunodeficiency it is noted that serum levels of immunoglobulins are extremely low but T-cell levels are normal. Which of the following molecules is present on the cells that this patient lacks? (C) CD3 (D) CD19 (E) NKG2D (A) CD4 (B) CD8
Reason: The low serum levels of immunoglobulins combined with normal T-cell levels suggest a B-cell immunodeficiency rather than a problem with T-cells. CD19 is a pan-B-cell marker, which indicates that this patient likely has a deficiency in B-cells, explaining the recurrent infections and low immunoglobulin levels.
Answer: (D) CD19

Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient’s condition? (B) Autoimmune neonatal thrombocytopenia (C) Alloimmune neonatal thrombocytopenia (D) Vitamin K deficiency (E) Platelet dysfunction (A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation
Reason: The presentation of the premature newborn, including petechiae, bruising, and pulmonary hemorrhage, along with coagulopathy indicated by prolonged prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time, suggests a systemic problem affecting coagulation. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is characterized by widespread activation of the coagulation cascade, leading to a consumption coagulopathy, which aligns with the findings of thrombocytopenia and bleeding complications in this patient.
Answer: (A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation
[INFO] Sampling path 10 completed.
[INFO] Opinion paths:
Path 1: Let's analyze the information provided step by step.

1. **Patient Profile**: The patient is a 56-year-old man with a history of non-small cell lung cancer, which can metastasize to bone. 

2. **Symptoms**: He has subacute back pain that is constant and worse at night, and there is point tenderness in the lumbosacral area. These characteristics raise suspicion for a serious underlying condition such as metastatic disease rather than a mechanical issue.

3. **History of Cancer**: His history of lung cancer, even though treated successfully, is significant as it raises the possibility of metastatic spread, particularly given the nonspecific nature of his back pain and the point tenderness.

4. **Imaging Findings**: 
   - In cases of metastatic bone disease from lung cancer, the typical imaging finding is lytic lesions, particularly in the spine. 
   - Blastic lesions are more commonly associated with prostate cancer rather than lung cancer.
   - Bulging discs, sacroilitis, and narrowing of the disc space are more consistent with degenerative changes or inflammatory conditions, which are less likely given the patient's cancer history and presentation.

Based on this reasoning, the most likely imaging finding in this patient, given his history and symptoms, is:

**Answer: (C) Lytic lesions of the lumbar spine.**
Path 2: Let's analyze the case step by step. 

The patient is a 56-year-old man with a history of non-small cell lung cancer. He presents with subacute back pain that is worse at night and point tenderness in the lumbosacral area. Given his cancer history, the concern for metastatic disease is significant. 

In cases of metastatic spread to the spine, the most common findings include:

- **Lytic lesions:** These are areas of bone destruction caused by tumor cells infiltrating the bone. Common in certain types of cancer, particularly those that metastasize to bone.
- **Blastic lesions:** These are areas of increased bone density due to abnormal bone formation, which can occur with certain cancers but is less common than lytic lesions in the setting of lung cancer.
- **Bulging discs, sacroilitis, and narrowing of the lumbar disc space** are more associated with degenerative disc disease or inflammatory conditions rather than metastatic disease.

Given the patient's history of lung cancer, the subacute nature of the pain, and the characteristics of the pain being worse at night, the most likely imaging finding would be **lytic lesions of the lumbar spine**, which are indicative of metastatic disease.

Therefore, the correct answer is: (C) Lytic lesions of the lumbar spine.
Path 3: Let's analyze the scenario step by step. 

1. The patient is a 56-year-old man with a history of non-small cell lung cancer that was treated successfully a year ago and had no recurrence on a PET scan at that time. 
2. He presents with subacute back pain for a month, described as a dull, constant ache that worsens at night. This type of pain can be concerning for a malignancy or metastatic process.
3. The point tenderness in the lumbosacral area and the history of cancer raise suspicion for potential metastatic involvement of the spine.

Given these factors, the most likely imaging finding in a patient with a history of lung cancer who presents with back pain and tenderness, especially concerning for metastases, would be lytic lesions in the lumbar spine. Lung cancer is known to metastasize to the bone, and lytic lesions are a common finding in such cases.

Thus, the correct answer is:
Answer: (C) Lytic lesions of the lumbar spine.
Path 4: Let's analyze the question step by step.

1. **Patient Background**: The patient is a 56-year-old man with a history of non-small cell lung cancer, which is relevant because certain cancers can metastasize to the bones, including the spine. 

2. **Symptoms**: He presents with subacute back pain that is worse at night and constant, which raises concern for a more serious underlying condition, such as malignancy or infection. Point tenderness in the lumbosacral area may indicate something specific to the spine itself.

3. **Imaging Findings**: Given the patient's history of lung cancer and the nature of his back pain, we need to consider the likelihood of metastatic disease. 

4. **Types of Lesions**: 
   - **Lytic lesions**: These are typically associated with certain types of cancers, including lung cancer, where the cancer cells invade and destroy bone.
   - **Blastic lesions**: These are less common in lung cancer and are more often seen in prostate cancer.
   - **Bulging disc**: This is more related to degenerative changes and would not typically cause the symptoms described in the context of a cancer history.
   - **Sacroilitis and fusion**: This is more indicative of inflammatory conditions like ankylosing spondylitis, not cancer.
   - **Narrowing of the lumbar disc space**: This is more related to degenerative disc disease.

5. **Conclusion**: Given this patient's history of non-small cell lung cancer and the presentation of back pain that is worse at night, the most likely imaging finding would be **lytic lesions of the lumbar spine** due to metastasis from his previous cancer.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
**(C) Lytic lesions of the lumbar spine.**
Path 5: Let's analyze the situation step by step.

1. **Patient Background**: The patient is a 56-year-old man with a history of non-small cell lung cancer, which is known to have a propensity to metastasize to the bones.

2. **Symptoms**: He presents with subacute back pain that is worse at night and some point tenderness in the lumbosacral area. The description of the pain and its worsening at night can be suggestive of a more serious underlying condition, such as metastatic disease.

3. **Previous Imaging**: A PET scan a year ago showed no recurrence of cancer, but given the history of lung cancer, there is still a risk for metastasis.

4. **Imaging Findings**: In cases of metastatic bone disease from non-small cell lung cancer, the most common imaging findings are lytic lesions due to bone destruction as cancer cells invade the bone.

Given this analysis, the most likely imaging finding in this patient would be:

**Answer: (C) Lytic lesions of the lumbar spine.**
Path 6: Let's analyze the patient's presentation step by step.

1. **Patient Background**: The patient is a 56-year-old man with a history of successfully treated non-small cell lung cancer. This is significant because lung cancer has a propensity to metastasize to the bones.

2. **Symptoms**: He presents with subacute back pain that is worse at night and has point tenderness in the lumbosacral area. The nature of the pain (dull, constant, worse at night) raises concern for a possible malignancy or metastasis.

3. **Imaging Findings**: Given the patient's history of lung cancer and the current symptoms, the most likely imaging finding would be related to bone metastasis. In this case, lung cancer typically metastasizes to bone in the form of lytic lesions rather than blastic lesions. Lytic lesions are areas of bone destruction, which can occur in the spine.

Based on this reasoning, the most likely imaging finding is:

**Answer: (C) Lytic lesions of the lumbar spine**.
Path 7: Let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. **Patient History**: The patient has a history of non-small cell lung cancer that was treated and showed no recurrence on a PET scan a year ago. However, he is now presenting with subacute back pain, worsened at night, and point tenderness in the lumbosacral area.

2. **Back Pain Characteristics**: The pain is described as a dull, constant ache that is worse at night. This pattern raises suspicion for a potential malignancy-related cause, especially given the patient's cancer history.

3. **Imaging Findings**:
   - **Lytic lesions of the lumbar spine** (Option C) are typically associated with metastases from malignancies, including lung cancer. This is a common finding in patients with a history of cancer presenting with new back pain.
   - **Blastic lesions of the lumbar spine** (Option A) can also occur but are more commonly associated with prostate cancer and certain other malignancies, not typically with lung cancer.
   - **Bulging disc impinging on lumbar spinal nerve** (Option B) is less likely given the patient's cancer history and the pain characteristics.
   - **Sacroilitis and fusion of the lumbar spine** (Option E) are more indicative of inflammatory conditions like ankylosing spondylitis, which doesn't fit the pattern here.
   - **Narrowing of the lumbar disc space** (Option D) could occur due to degenerative disc disease but does not fit the malignancy-related suspicion.

4. **Conclusion**: Given the patient's cancer history, the nature of the pain, and the point tenderness, the most likely imaging finding would be **lytic lesions of the lumbar spine** due to metastatic disease.

Therefore, the correct answer is: **(C) Lytic lesions of the lumbar spine**.
Path 8: Let's analyze the information step by step.

The patient is a 56-year-old man with a history of non-small cell lung cancer that was treated successfully, and he has been experiencing subacute back pain for the past month. The pain is described as worse at night, which is concerning for a possible malignancy or metastasis. 

In patients with a history of cancer, back pain that is persistent and worse at night raises suspicion for metastatic disease, particularly considering the history of lung cancer. 

In the context of lung cancer, metastases to the spine typically present as lytic lesions, as lung cancer is most commonly associated with osteolytic bone metastases. 

Given these details, the most likely imaging finding in this patient would be:

Answer: (C) Lytic lesions of the lumbar spine.
Path 9: Let's analyze the case step by step:

1. **Patient Background**: The patient is a 56-year-old man with a history of non-small cell lung cancer that was treated successfully. He now presents with subacute back pain that is worse at night, which is significant because night pain can be a red flag for serious underlying conditions, including cancer.

2. **Nature of Pain**: The pain is described as dull and constant, which can indicate a structural issue rather than a simple muscular strain. The history of recent weight lifting may or may not be related, but the persistent nature of the pain raises concern for something more serious.

3. **Imaging Findings**: Given the patient's history of lung cancer, even though he had a PET scan a year ago that showed no recurrence, the risk of metastasis cannot be excluded, especially since he presents with back pain. In the case of lung cancer, the most common bone metastases would typically present as lytic lesions due to the nature of the cancer cells that tend to lead to bone destruction.

4. **Assessment of Options**:
   - (A) Blastic lesions of the lumbar spine: These would be more characteristic of prostate cancer or other cancers that cause osteoblastic activity, not lung cancer.
   - (B) Bulging disc impinging on lumbar spinal nerve: This is a common cause of back pain but does not fit the profile given the history of cancer.
   - (C) Lytic lesions of the lumbar spine: This aligns with the possibility of metastatic disease from lung cancer.
   - (D) Narrowing of the lumbar disc space: This is typically seen in degenerative disc disease, which is less likely given his age and presentation.
   - (E) Sacroilitis and fusion of the lumbar spine: This is more indicative of inflammatory conditions such as ankylosing spondylitis, which is unlikely given the patient's cancer history and presentation.

Based on this analysis, the most likely imaging finding in this patient is:

**Answer: (C) Lytic lesions of the lumbar spine**
Path 10: Let's analyze the scenario step by step:

1. **Patient Profile**: The patient is a 56-year-old man with a history of non-small cell lung cancer, which is relevant in considering the potential for metastasis.

2. **Symptoms**: He presents with subacute back pain, described as a dull, constant ache that worsens at night. This pattern is concerning for possible malignancy or other serious conditions, as night pain can be indicative of a more significant underlying pathology.

3. **Physical Exam**: The presence of point tenderness along the lumbosacral area without other significant findings could suggest localized pathology, potentially related to the spine.

4. **Cancer History**: Given his history of lung cancer, there is a possibility that the cancer could have metastasized to the spine. Lung cancer commonly metastasizes to bone, and the lumbar spine is a common site for such metastases.

5. **Imaging Findings**: 
   - **Lytic lesions** (C) would indicate areas of bone destruction, which are common in metastatic disease from cancers such as lung cancer.
   - **Blastic lesions** (A) indicate increased bone density, often associated with prostate cancer rather than lung cancer.
   - **Bulging disc** (B) is less likely given the cancer history and the nature of the pain.
   - **Sacroilitis and fusion** (E) suggest inflammatory disease, which does not fit this clinical picture.
   - **Narrowing of the lumbar disc space** (D) is more indicative of degenerative changes rather than metastatic disease.

Considering the above points, the most likely imaging finding in this patient, given his history of non-small cell lung cancer and the presentation of back pain with point tenderness, is:

**Answer: (C) Lytic lesions of the lumbar spine.**

Question: Twelve days after undergoing total pancreatectomy for chronic pancreatitis, a 62-year-old woman notices oozing from her abdominal wound. She first noticed fluid draining 8 hours ago. Her postoperative course has been complicated by persistent hypotension requiring intravenous fluids and decreased ability to tolerate food. She has type 1 diabetes mellitus and glaucoma. The patient smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 30 years, but quit 2 years ago. She drank a pint of vodka every day starting at age 20 and quit when she was 35 years old. Her current medications include subcutaneous insulin and timolol eye drops. She appears comfortable. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 95/min, and blood pressure is 104/78 mm Hg. The abdomen is soft and mildly tender to palpation. There is a 12-cm vertical wound beginning in the epigastrium and extending caudally. 25 mL of a viscous, dark green substance is draining from the middle of the wound. There is a small amount of dried fluid on the patient's hospital gown. The wound edges are nonerythematous. There is no pus draining from the wound. Laboratory studies show:
Hematocrit 38%
Leukocyte count 8,000/mm3
Serum
Na+ 135 mEq/L
Cl- 100 mEq/L
K+ 3.4 mEq/L
HCO3- 23 mEq/L
Urea nitrogen 13 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.1 mg/dL
Glucose 190 mg/dL
Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?" (A) Intravenous antibiotic therapy (C) Oral food intake and intravenous fluid administration (E) Wound debridement and irrigation
" (B) Surgical exploration of the abdomen (D) Total parenteral nutrition and ostomy pouch
Reason: The most appropriate next step in management is (D) Total parenteral nutrition and ostomy pouch. The patient's postoperative course is complicated by persistent hypotension and an inability to tolerate food, likely indicating gastrointestinal dysfunction following total pancreatectomy, which can lead to malabsorption. Since the patient is not able to tolerate oral intake and is experiencing drainage from the abdominal wound, total parenteral nutrition may provide necessary nutrition while an ostomy pouch allows for the management of any bowel output or drainage complications, addressing both nutritional needs and potential gastrointestinal issues.
Answer: (D) Total parenteral nutrition and ostomy pouch

Question: A 43-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 6-week history of hoarseness and difficulty swallowing. She also has a history of lower back pain treated with ibuprofen. She is 162 cm (5 ft 4 in) tall and weighs 77 kg (169 lb); BMI is 29 kg/m2. Her pulse is 64/min and blood pressure is 130/86 mm Hg. Physical examination shows dry skin, swelling of the lower extremities, and a hard nontender anterior neck swelling that does not move with swallowing. Femoral and pedal pulses are decreased bilaterally. A biopsy of the neck swelling is most likely to show which of the following findings? (E) Lymphocytic infiltrate and germinal center formation (A) Atypical nuclei and concentric lamellar calcifications (B) Spindle cells and areas of focal necrosis (C) Collagen deposition and decreased number of follicles (D) Giant cells and noncaseating granulomas
Reason: The biopsy of the neck swelling is most likely to show (C) Collagen deposition and decreased number of follicles. The patient's symptoms, including hoarseness, difficulty swallowing, and the presence of a hard nontender anterior neck swelling, are consistent with chronic thyroiditis, specifically Hashimoto's thyroiditis, which is characterized by an autoimmune process leading to the destruction of thyroid follicles and replacement with fibrous tissue (collagen deposition). This results in decreased follicular structures in the thyroid gland, reflecting the underlying pathology.
Answer: (C) Collagen deposition and decreased number of follicles

Question: A 30-year-old man is brought to the emergency department with complaints of fevers to 39.0℃ (102.2℉) and diarrhea for the past 12 hours. There is no history of headaches, vomiting, or loss of consciousness. The past medical history is unobtainable because the patient recently immigrated from abroad and has a language barrier, but his wife says that her husband had a motor vehicle accident when he was a teenager that required emergent surgery. He is transferred to the ICU after a few hours in the ED due to dyspnea, cyanosis, and hemodynamic collapse. There are no signs of a meningeal infection. The blood pressure is 70/30 mm Hg at the time of transfer. A chest X-ray at the time of admission shows interstitial infiltrates without homogeneous opacities. The initial laboratory results reveal metabolic acidosis, leukopenia with a count of 2000/mm3, thrombocytopenia (15,000/mm3), and a coagulation profile suggesting disseminated intravascular coagulation. A peripheral smear is performed as shown in the accompanying image. Despite ventilatory support, administration of intravenous fluids, antibiotics, and vasopressor agents, the patient dies the next day. The gram stain from the autopsy specimen of his lungs reveals gram-positive, lancet-shaped diplococci occurring singly and in chains. Which of the following organisms is the most likely cause for the patient’s condition? (D) Neisseria meningitidis (B) Streptococcus pyogene (C) Streptococcus pneumoniae (E) Non-typeable H. influenzae (A) Staphylococcus aureus
Reason: The answer is (C) Streptococcus pneumoniae because the clinical presentation, including the acute onset of fever, diarrhea, and respiratory distress, combined with the lab findings of leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and a lung autopsy showing gram-positive, lancet-shaped diplococci, strongly suggests a severe pneumonia caused by this organism. Additionally, the interstitial infiltrates observed on the chest X-ray and the patient's rapid decline align with the complications associated with a pneumococcal infection, such as sepsis and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
Answer: (C) Streptococcus pneumoniae

Question: A 63-year-old man presents to the emergency department complaining of sudden-onset severe dyspnea and right-sided chest pain. The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, peptic ulcer disease, and hyperthyroidism. He has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for 20 years, drinks socially, and does not take illicit drugs. The blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg, the pulse is 98/min and regular, and the respiratory rate is 20/min. Pulse oximetry shows 90% on room air. On physical examination, he is in mild respiratory distress. Tactile fremitus and breath sounds are decreased on the right, with hyperresonance on percussion. The trachea is midline and no heart murmurs are heard. Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's current condition? (C) Perforation of a peptic ulcer (E) Rupture of an apical alveolar bleb (B) Formation of an intimal flap in the aorta (A) Compression of a main bronchus due to neoplasia (D) Increased myocardial oxygen demand
Reason: The answer is (E) Rupture of an apical alveolar bleb because the patient's sudden onset of severe dyspnea and right-sided chest pain, accompanied by decreased breath sounds and hyperresonance on percussion on the right side, are classic signs of a pneumothorax. Given his history of smoking and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which can lead to the formation of blebs or bullae in the lungs, a rupture in this context would explain the acute respiratory distress and physical findings.
Answer: (E) Rupture of an apical alveolar bleb

Question: A 13-year-old girl is brought to the physician by her parents for the evaluation of progressive hair loss over the past 2 months. The parents report that they have noticed increased number of hairless patches on their daughter's head. The patient denies any itching. There is no personal or family history of serious illness. The patient states that she has been feeling tense since her boyfriend broke up with her. She does not smoke or drink alcohol. She does not use illicit drugs. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows ill-defined patchy hair loss and hair of different lengths with no scaling or reddening of the scalp. Further examination shows poor hair growth of the eyebrows and eyelashes. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? (E) Trichotillomania (A) Tinea capitis (B) Scarring alopecia (C) Telogen effluvium (D) Alopecia areata
Reason: The answer is (E) Trichotillomania because the symptoms align with the behavior of compulsively pulling out one's hair, which is often associated with stress or emotional distress, as indicated by the patient's recent breakup. The pattern of hair loss described—patchy areas with varying hair lengths and no signs of inflammation—suggests the child may be engaging in this behavior subconsciously, rather than a dermatological condition like tinea capitis or alopecia areata, which have distinct signs and symptoms.
Answer: (E) Trichotillomania

Question: A 24-year-old sexually active man complains of painless growths on his penis. He is worried that he might have transmitted them to his girlfriend. Biopsy shows squamous cells with perinuclear cytoplasmic vacuolization, nuclear enlargement, and koilocytes. The doctor treats the patient by chemically ablating the warts with cryoablation. The patient encourages his girlfriend to get tested too, as he is worried she is at increased risk of developing a malignancy. Which cancer is the patient worried about? (A) Kaposi sarcoma (E) Cervical carcinoma (C) Hairy cell leukemia (D) Hepatocellular carcinoma (B) Burkitt lymphoma
Reason: The patient's concern about his girlfriend developing a malignancy is notably linked to the human papillomavirus (HPV), which is known to be a significant risk factor for cervical carcinoma. Given that the biopsy findings indicated the presence of koilocytic changes, which are characteristic of HPV infection, this aligns with the risk of cervical cancer for sexually active females with partners who have visible genital lesions associated with HPV.
Answer: (E) Cervical carcinoma

Question: A 43-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department for evaluation of worsening abdominal pain that suddenly started 2 hours ago. The patient also has nausea and has vomited twice. She has hypothyroidism, systemic lupus erythematosus, major depressive disorder, and chronic right knee pain. Current medications include levothyroxine, prednisone, fluoxetine, naproxen, and a chondroitin sulfate supplement. She appears distressed. Her temperature is 37.9°C (100.2°F), pulse is 101/min, and blood pressure is 115/70 mm Hg. Examination shows a rigid abdomen with rebound tenderness; bowel sounds are hypoactive. Laboratory studies show a leukocyte count of 13,300/mm3 and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 70 mm/h. An x-ray of the chest is shown. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? (D) Abdominal CT with contrast (B) Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (C) Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (A) Peritoneal lavage (E) Exploratory laparotomy
Reason: The patient's presentation, including worsening abdominal pain, rigidity, rebound tenderness, and hypoactive bowel sounds, suggests an acute abdomen, potentially due to a surgical emergency such as perforation or acute pancreatitis, especially given her symptoms of nausea and vomiting. The high leukocyte count and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate further indicate an inflammatory process, and an exploratory laparotomy is warranted to diagnose and address any intra-abdominal pathology immediately.
Answer: (E) Exploratory laparotomy

Question: A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after being found down on the sidewalk. On presentation, he is found to have overdosed on opioids so he is given naloxone and quickly recovers. Physical exam also reveals lumps on his neck and face that are covered by small yellow granules. These lumps are slowly draining yellow pus-like fluid. He says that these lumps have been present for several months, but he has ignored them because he has not had any fever or pain from the lumps. He does not recall the last time he visited a primary care physician or a dentist. Oral exam reveals multiple cavities and abscesses. The most likely cause of this patient's facial lumps has which of the following characteristics? (A) Acid-fast rods (E) Gram-positive rod (D) Gram-positive cocci (B) Gram-negative cocci (C) Gram-negative rod
Reason: The patient's facial lumps characterized by yellow granules and pus drainage suggest a chronic infection, which is consistent with actinomycosis, often caused by Actinomyces israelii, a gram-positive rod. Additionally, the patient's history of poor dental hygiene, indicated by multiple cavities and abscesses, supports the likelihood of an actinomycosis infection that can stem from oral sources, reinforcing the association with gram-positive rods.
Answer: (E) Gram-positive rod

Question: A 20-year-old primigravid woman comes to the physician in October for her first prenatal visit. She has delayed the visit because she wanted a “natural birth” but was recently convinced to get a checkup after feeling more tired than usual. She feels well. Menarche was at the age of 12 years and menses used to occur at regular 28-day intervals and last 3–7 days. The patient emigrated from Mexico 2 years ago. Her immunization records are unavailable. Pelvic examination shows a uterus consistent in size with a 28-week gestation. Laboratory studies show:
Hemoglobin 12.4 g/dL
Leukocyte count 8,000/mm3
Blood group B negative
Serum
Glucose 88 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.1 mg/dL
TSH 3.8 μU/mL
Rapid plasma reagin negative
HIV antibody negative
Hepatitis B surface antigen negative
Urinalysis shows no abnormalities. Urine culture is negative. Chlamydia and gonorrhea testing are negative. A Pap smear is normal. Administration of which of the following vaccines is most appropriate at this time?" (D) Hepatitis B and MMR (B) Varicella and Tdap (E) Influenza only (A) Tdap and influenza (C) Varicella and influenza
Reason: The answer is (A) Tdap and influenza. This is the most appropriate choice because during pregnancy, vaccination against pertussis (Tdap) is recommended to protect the newborn, and the influenza vaccine is also advised during flu season to protect both the mother and the fetus from influenza-related complications. Since the patient is at her first prenatal visit and her immunization records are unavailable, administering these vaccines is crucial for her health and the health of her baby.

Question: A 48-year-old woman comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. At her visit 1 month ago, her glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was 100 mL/min/1.73 m2 and her renal plasma flow (RPF) was 588 mL/min. Today, her RPF is 540 mL/min and her filtration fraction (FF) is 0.2. After her previous appointment, this patient was most likely started on a drug that has which of the following effects? (E) Constriction of the efferent arteriole (C) Inhibition of vasopressin (D) Constriction of the afferent arteriole (A) Relaxation of urinary smooth muscle (B) Inhibition of the renal Na-K-Cl cotransporter
Reason: The answer is (E) Constriction of the efferent arteriole. This conclusion is supported by the fact that the filtration fraction (FF) is calculated by dividing the GFR by the RPF, and both values help to assess renal function. With a decrease in RPF and a relatively stable GFR, constriction of the efferent arteriole would increase the FF, as it promotes higher pressure in the glomerulus, allowing for a consistent filtration rate despite the drop in RPF.
Answer: (E) Constriction of the efferent arteriole

Question: A 34-year-old female medical professional who works for a non-governmental organization visits her primary care provider for a routine health check-up. She made a recent trip to Sub-Saharan Africa where she participated in a humanitarian medical project. Her medical history and physical examination are unremarkable. A chest radiograph and a tuberculin skin test (PPD) are ordered. The chest radiograph is performed at the side and the PPD reaction measures 12 mm after 72 hours. Which of the following mechanisms is involved in the skin test reaction? (B) Opsonization (A) Formation of immune complexes (C) Complement activation (E) IgE cross-linking (D) Th1-mediated cytotoxicity
Reason: The answer is (D) Th1-mediated cytotoxicity. This is the appropriate answer because the tuberculin skin test (PPD) reaction is a type of delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction that primarily involves T-helper 1 (Th1) cells, which release cytokines that activate macrophages and mediate an inflammatory response. This cellular immune response is essential for the recognition and containment of intracellular pathogens like Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
Answer: (D) Th1-mediated cytotoxicity

Question: A 27-year-old woman presents to the emergency room with a rash over her shins for the last 3 months. She also has a swell in her knee and wrist joints on both sides for a few days. The rash is painful and erythematous. She had an episode of uveitis 6 months ago that was treated with topical therapy. She is not on any medication currently. In addition, she stated that 3 weeks ago she went hiking with her family and found a tick attached to her left thigh. Her vital signs include a blood pressure of 135/85 mm Hg, a pulse of 85/min, and a respiratory rate of 12/min. Physical examination shows swelling of the ankles, knees, and wrists bilaterally, and well-demarcated papules over the anterior aspect of both legs. A chest X-ray is performed and demonstrates bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy. Which of the following is the pathophysiologic mechanism behind this patient’s condition? (A) Loss of protection against proteases (E) Activation of Langerhans cells (C) Release of toxins by spirochete (B) Formation of caseating granulomas (D) Activation of T lymphocytes
Reason: The answer is (D) Activation of T lymphocytes because the clinical presentation suggests an autoimmune or inflammatory condition, possibly sarcoidosis, characterized by erythema, joint swelling, and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, all of which involve T lymphocyte-mediated immune responses. The presence of such symptoms indicates that the immune system is responding inappropriately, which often involves T cell activation leading to inflammation and granuloma formation.

Question: A previously healthy 2-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother after 2 days of fever, runny nose, hoarseness, and severe, dry cough. He appears restless. His temperature is 38.1°C (100.5°F), and his respiratory rate is 39/min. Examination shows clear rhinorrhea and a barking cough. There is a prolonged inspiratory phase with a harsh stridor upon agitation. An x-ray of the neck shows tapering of the subglottic region. Which of the following is the most likely causal organism? (A) Adenovirus (C) Haemophilus influenzae (B) Streptococcus pneumoniae (D) Parainfluenza virus (E) Measles morbillivirus
Reason: The answer is (D) Parainfluenza virus because the symptoms presented, such as a barking cough, stridor, and the history of a respiratory illness in a young child, are characteristic of croup, which is most commonly caused by the parainfluenza virus. The x-ray findings of subglottic narrowing also support this diagnosis, as they typically correspond with viral croup, specifically linked to parainfluenza infection.

Question: A 26-year-old G1P0 woman at 40 weeks estimated gestational age presents after experiencing labor pains. Pregnancy has been uncomplicated so far. Rupture of membranes occurs, and a transvaginal delivery is performed under epidural anesthesia, and the baby is delivered alive and healthy. The patient voids a few hours after the delivery and complains of mild irritation at the injection site on her back. On the second day, she complains of a severe headache over the back of her head. The headache is associated with pain and stiffness in the neck. Her headache is aggravated by sitting up or standing and relieved by lying down. The pain is relieved slightly by acetaminophen and ibuprofen. The patient is afebrile. Her vital signs include: pulse 100/min, respiratory rate 18/min, and blood pressure 128/84 mm Hg. Which of the following statements is the most accurate regarding this patient’s condition? (A) This patient’s condition can resolve on its own (C) Excessive bed rest will worsen this patient’s condition (D) A blockage of CSF is the cause of this patient’s headache (E) Immediate intervention is required (B) An infection is present at the site of epidural injection site
Reason: The answer is (A) This patient’s condition can resolve on its own because the symptoms described—severe headache exacerbated by sitting or standing, neck pain and stiffness—are indicative of a post-dural puncture headache, which often improves with conservative management, such as rest and hydration. While the condition can be quite uncomfortable, it typically resolves over time without the need for invasive interventions.

Question: A newborn infant is born at 42 weeks gestation to a healthy 36-year-old G1P0. The delivery was complicated by prolonged labor and shoulder dystocia. The child is in the 87th and 91st percentiles for height and weight at birth, respectively. The mother’s past medical history is notable for diabetes mellitus and obesity. Immediately after birth, the child’s temperature is 99°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 90/50 mmHg, pulse is 120/min, and respirations are 24/min. The child demonstrates a strong cry and pink upper and lower extremities bilaterally. The right arm is adducted and internally rotated at the shoulder and extended at the elbow. Flexion and extension of the wrist and digits appear to be intact in the right upper extremity. Which of the following muscles would most likely have normal strength in this patient? (A) Teres minor (C) Brachioradialis (D) Biceps (B) Brachialis (E) Triceps
Reason: The answer is (E) Triceps because the clinical scenario suggests the infant has Erb's palsy due to upper brachial plexus injury (typically from shoulder dystocia), which affects muscles innervated by the C5 and C6 nerves. The triceps muscle is primarily innervated by the radial nerve (C7, C8), which is not affected in this type of injury, thus preserving its strength.

Question: A 6-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of right hip pain that started that afternoon. His mother reports that he has also been limping since the pain developed. He says that the pain worsens when he moves or walks. He participated in a dance recital yesterday, but his mother believes that he was not injured at the time. He was born at term and has been healthy except for an episode of nasal congestion and mild cough 10 days ago. His mother has rheumatoid arthritis and his grandmother has osteoporosis. He is at the 50th percentile for height and 50th percentile for weight. His temperature is 37.5°C (99.6°F), pulse is 105/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 90/78 mm Hg. His right hip is slightly abducted and externally rotated. Examination shows no tenderness, warmth, or erythema. He is able to bear weight. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show a hemoglobin concentration of 12.3 g/dL, a leukocyte count of 8,500/mm3, and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 12 mm/h. Ultrasound of the right hip shows increased fluid within the joint. X-ray of the hips shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? (E) Osteomyelitis (B) Transient synovitis (D) Developmental dysplasia of the hip (C) Legg-Calve-Perthes disease (A) Slipped capital femoral epiphysis
Reason: The most likely diagnosis for this 6-year-old boy is transient synovitis (B) because the presentation includes acute hip pain, limping, and an ultrasound showing increased fluid within the joint without evidence of a preceding injury. Additionally, the absence of systemic signs of infection (normal leukocyte count and low ESR) and the boy's ability to bear weight further support this diagnosis, which is characterized by inflammation of the hip joint that often follows a viral illness.

Question: Two weeks after undergoing an allogeneic skin graft procedure for extensive full-thickness burns involving his left leg, a 41-year-old man develops redness and swelling over the graft site. He has not had any fevers or chills. His temperature is 36°C (96.8°F). Physical examination of the left lower leg shows well-demarcated erythema and edema around the skin graft site. The graft site is minimally tender and there is no exudate. Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient’s skin condition? (A) Opsonization-induced cell destruction (D) Antibody-mediated complement activation (E) Th1-induced macrophage activation (B) Immune complex-mediated complement activation (C) Staphylococci-induced neutrophil activation
Reason: The most likely underlying mechanism of this patient’s skin condition is Th1-induced macrophage activation (E) because the well-demarcated erythema and edema around the graft site suggest a typical example of acute cellular rejection, which is mediated by T-cells, specifically the Th1 subset. In this scenario, the activated Th1 cells release cytokines that recruit and activate macrophages, contributing to the inflammatory response seen in skin graft rejection.
Answer: (E) Th1-induced macrophage activation

(A) Epilepsy (B) Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (E) Neuroendocrine pancreatic tumor (C) Migraine headache (D) Mitral valve prolapse
Reason: The correct answer is (D) Mitral valve prolapse. Given the patient's profile, including his age, family history of cardiovascular disease, and poorly managed hypertension, he may be at risk for various cardiovascular issues. Mitral valve prolapse is often associated with connective tissue disorders and can occur in individuals with a history of hypertension or familial heart conditions, making him susceptible to this cardiac abnormality.
Answer: (D) Mitral valve prolapse
[INFO] Sampling path 10 completed.
[INFO] Opinion paths:
Path 1: Let's analyze the situation step by step.

The patient is experiencing a reaction after consuming alcohol while being treated with metronidazole. This combination can lead to a disulfiram-like reaction, which is characterized by symptoms such as facial flushing, nausea, tachycardia, dyspnea, headache, and abdominal cramps. This occurs because metronidazole inhibits the enzyme acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, leading to the accumulation of acetaldehyde when alcohol is consumed.

Given this information, the serum levels of (A) Acetaldehyde are likely elevated in this patient following alcohol consumption. 

So the answer is: **(A) Acetaldehyde.**
Path 2: Let's analyze the situation step by step. 

The 22-year-old female has been treated with metronidazole, which is known to cause a disulfiram-like reaction when alcohol is consumed. This reaction occurs because metronidazole inhibits the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase, leading to the accumulation of acetaldehyde when alcohol is ingested.

The symptoms she experiences after drinking alcohol, such as facial flushing, nausea, tachycardia, dyspnea, headache, and abdominal cramps, are consistent with this disulfiram-like reaction, which indicates an elevated level of acetaldehyde due to the inhibition of its metabolism.

Given the options provided, the serum levels of acetaldehyde (A) are likely elevated in this patient following alcohol consumption.

Answer: (A) Acetaldehyde
Path 3: Let's analyze the situation step by step. The patient is being treated with metronidazole, which can cause a disulfiram-like reaction when alcohol is consumed. This reaction is characterized by symptoms such as flushing, nausea, tachycardia, dyspnea, headache, and abdominal cramps due to the accumulation of acetaldehyde when alcohol is ingested.

In this context, the consumption of alcohol leads to the inhibition of the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase, which normally metabolizes acetaldehyde to acetic acid. As a result, acetaldehyde levels rise in the body, leading to the symptoms the patient experienced.

Based on this reasoning, the serum levels of **acetaldehyde** are likely elevated in this patient following alcohol consumption.

Thus, the correct answer is **(A) Acetaldehyde**.
Path 4: Let's think step by step. The patient has been treated with metronidazole, which is known to cause a disulfiram-like reaction when alcohol is consumed. This reaction occurs because metronidazole inhibits the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase, leading to the accumulation of acetaldehyde, a toxic metabolite of alcohol. 

Given her symptoms of facial flushing, nausea, tachycardia, dyspnea, headache, and abdominal cramps after consuming alcohol, it is highly likely that the serum levels of acetaldehyde have increased due to this interaction.

Therefore, the correct answer is: **(A) Acetaldehyde**.
Path 5: Let's think through the scenario step by step.

The patient is being treated with metronidazole, which is known to interact negatively with alcohol. When alcohol is consumed, it is metabolized primarily to acetaldehyde by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase, and then acetaldehyde is further metabolized to acetic acid by acetaldehyde dehydrogenase.

In the presence of metronidazole, the metabolism of acetaldehyde is inhibited, leading to an accumulation of acetaldehyde in the body. This accumulation is responsible for the adverse reactions experienced by the patient, such as facial flushing, nausea, tachycardia, dyspnea, headache, and abdominal cramps.

Given this information, the serum levels of acetaldehyde are likely elevated in this patient following alcohol consumption.

Thus, the correct answer is:
(A) Acetaldehyde.
Path 6: Let's think through the clinical scenario step by step. The patient is experiencing a reaction after consuming alcohol shortly after being treated with metronidazole. This reaction is consistent with a disulfiram-like reaction, which occurs when alcohol is consumed in conjunction with certain medications, including metronidazole. 

In this case, metronidazole inhibits the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase, which normally helps metabolize acetaldehyde (a toxic byproduct of alcohol metabolism) into acetic acid. As a result, when alcohol is consumed, acetaldehyde accumulates in the body, leading to the symptoms described (flushing, nausea, tachycardia, etc.).

Given this understanding, the serum levels of acetaldehyde are likely elevated following alcohol consumption in this patient.

Thus, the correct answer is:
(A) Acetaldehyde
Path 7: Let's analyze the scenario step by step:

The patient is experiencing symptoms after consuming alcohol shortly after taking metronidazole. One of the common and important interactions between metronidazole and alcohol is the disulfiram-like reaction. This reaction occurs due to the accumulation of acetaldehyde when alcohol is consumed, as metronidazole inhibits the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase, which is responsible for metabolizing acetaldehyde into acetic acid.

Given this context, the serum levels of acetaldehyde are likely to be elevated in this patient following alcohol consumption due to the interaction with metronidazole.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) Acetaldehyde.
Path 8: Let's analyze the situation step by step.

The patient is being treated with metronidazole, which can cause a disulfiram-like reaction if alcohol is consumed. This reaction occurs because metronidazole inhibits the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase, leading to the accumulation of acetaldehyde when alcohol is ingested.

The symptoms experienced by the patient after consuming alcohol—facial flushing, nausea, tachycardia, dyspnea, headache, and abdominal cramps—are consistent with this disulfiram-like reaction. 

Given this context, the serum levels of the following substance are likely to be elevated after alcohol consumption due to the inhibition of its breakdown:

(A) Acetaldehyde

Thus, the answer is (A) Acetaldehyde.
Path 9: Let's analyze the scenario step by step. 

The patient is experiencing a reaction after consuming alcohol while on metronidazole, which is known to cause a disulfiram-like reaction when alcohol is consumed. This reaction occurs because metronidazole inhibits the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase, which is responsible for metabolizing acetaldehyde, a toxic byproduct of alcohol metabolism.

When alcohol is consumed, it is metabolized to acetaldehyde, and due to the inhibition of aldehyde dehydrogenase by metronidazole, acetaldehyde accumulates in the body. This accumulation leads to the symptoms experienced by the patient, such as facial flushing, nausea, tachycardia, dyspnea, headache, and abdominal cramps.

Given this understanding, the serum levels of acetaldehyde are likely elevated following alcohol consumption in this patient.

Therefore, the correct answer is: (A) Acetaldehyde.
Path 10: Let's analyze the scenario step by step:

1. The patient is a 22-year-old female who was treated with metronidazole. It's important to note that metronidazole can interact with alcohol, leading to a disulfiram-like reaction.

2. After consuming alcohol, she experiences symptoms including facial flushing, nausea, tachycardia, dyspnea, headache, and abdominal cramps. These symptoms are consistent with the effects of acetaldehyde accumulation due to the inhibition of its metabolism.

3. The mechanism behind this reaction involves the inhibition of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) by metronidazole, which prevents the conversion of acetaldehyde (a toxic byproduct of alcohol metabolism) into acetate. As a result, acetaldehyde accumulates in the body when alcohol is consumed.

Given this information, the serum levels of which substance are likely elevated in this patient following alcohol consumption?

The correct answer is (A) Acetaldehyde.
[INFO] Final decision by majority voting
After reviewing the 10 different reasoning paths, it is clear that all paths consistently arrive at the same conclusion regarding the elevated serum levels of acetaldehyde due to the interaction between metronidazole and alcohol consumption. Each path accurately describes the mechanism of the disulfiram-like reaction and the resulting symptoms experienced by the patient.

The majority voting results in the following:

- **(A) Acetaldehyde**: 10 votes (all paths)

Since all paths unanimously agree on the answer, the final decision is:

**(A) Acetaldehyde.**

Question: A 23-year-old female college basketball player presents in Sports Clinic after she felt a "pop" in her knee after coming down with a rebound. To examine the patient, you have her lie down on the table with her knees flexed 90 degrees. With your hand around her knee you are able to draw the tibia toward you from underneath the femur. The torn structure implicated by this physical exam maneuver has which of the following attachments? (C) The patella and tibial tuberosity (D) The lateral epicondyle of the femur and the head of fibula (E) The medial condyle of the femur and the medial condyle of the tibia (B) The anterior intercondylar area of tibia and the posteromedial aspect of the lateral femur (A) The posterior intercondylar area of tibia and the posteromedial aspect of the lateral femur
Reason: The answer is (B) The anterior intercondylar area of tibia and the posteromedial aspect of the lateral femur because this describes the attachment points of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), which is commonly implicated in injuries that occur with a "pop" sensation during activities involving pivoting, such as basketball. The physical exam maneuver of drawing the tibia forward from under the femur suggests a positive anterior drawer test, which is indicative of ACL instability.
Answer: (B) The anterior intercondylar area of tibia and the posteromedial aspect of the lateral femur

Question: A 2-year-old boy is brought to the pediatrician for recurrent nosebleeds. The boy was adopted two months ago and the parents have no record of his medical or family history. They report that the child has had frequent prolonged nosebleeds several times per week. Despite them applying pressure on the distal aspect of the nares and keeping his head elevated, the bleeding generally continues for hours. On exam, the boy appears pale and lethargic. A blood sample is obtained but the child bleeds through multiple pieces of gauze. No agglutination is observed when ristocetin is added to the patient’s blood. The addition of normal plasma to the sample still does not lead to agglutination. This patient has a condition that is most consistent with which of the following modes of transmission? (E) X-linked recessive (D) X-linked dominant (B) Autosomal recessive (C) Mitochondrial (A) Autosomal dominant
Reason: The answer is (B) Autosomal recessive because the symptoms and laboratory findings are suggestive of von Willebrand disease, which can have an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, particularly in its more severe forms. Given the child's recurrent nosebleeds, prolonged bleeding time, and lack of agglutination with ristocetin, this indicates a deficiency in von Willebrand factor, often observed in hereditary bleeding disorders that follow an autosomal recessive pattern.
Answer: (B) Autosomal recessive

Question: During normal respiration in the lungs, oxygen is absorbed into the bloodstream and carbon dioxide is released. The oxygen is used in cells as the final electron acceptor during oxidative phosphorylation, and carbon dioxide is generated during each turn of the tricarboxylic citric acid cycle (TCA). Which of the following steps in the TCA cycle generates a molecule of carbon dioxide? (B) Isocitrate to alpha ketoglutarate (A) Citrate to isocitrate (E) Malate to oxaloacetate (D) Fumarate to Malate (C) Succinyl-CoA to succinate
Reason: The answer is (B) Isocitrate to alpha ketoglutarate because this step in the TCA cycle involves the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate, resulting in the release of one molecule of carbon dioxide. During this process, isocitrate is converted into alpha-ketoglutarate while simultaneously reducing NAD+ to NADH, which highlights the production of CO2 during this critical phase of the cycle.
Answer: (B) Isocitrate to alpha ketoglutarate

Question: A 23-year-old man is evaluated as a potential kidney donor for his father. His medical history is significant only for mild recurrent infections as a child. He subsequently undergoes a donor nephrectomy that is complicated by unexpected blood loss. During resuscitation, he is transfused with 4 units of O negative packed red blood cells. Shortly after the transfusion begins, he develops generalized pruritus. His temperature is 37.2°C (98.9°F), pulse is 144/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 80/64 mm Hg. Physical examination shows expiratory wheezing in all lung fields and multiple pink, edematous wheals over the trunk and neck. His hemoglobin concentration is 8 g/dL. Serum studies show a haptoglobin concentration of 78 mg/dL (N = 30–200) and lactate dehydrogenase level of 80 U/L. This patient's underlying condition is most likely due to which of the following? (E) Impaired development of the third and fourth pharyngeal pouches (B) Absence of neutrophilic reactive oxygen species (D) Absence of mature circulating B cells (A) Impaired production of secretory immunoglobulins (C) Dysfunction of phagosome-lysosome fusion
Reason: The most likely underlying condition in this case is impaired production of secretory immunoglobulins, commonly associated with conditions like Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID) or similar immunologic disorders. The patient experiences a transfusion reaction characterized by symptoms such as pruritus, wheezing, and hypotension, which can stem from an inadequate immune response, leading to increased susceptibility to allergens or blood products when the normal humoral immunity (including secretory IgA and other immunoglobulins) is compromised. This explains the acute allergic reaction in the context of his transfusion.
Answer: (A) Impaired production of secretory immunoglobulins

Question: A 71-year-old woman comes to the physician because of dizziness and intermittent episodes of heart palpitations for 5 days. During this time, she has also had one episode of syncope. An ECG shows absence of P waves and irregular RR intervals. Treatment with an antiarrhythmic drug is initiated. The effect of the drug on the cardiac action potential is shown. Which of the following cardiac ion channels is most likely targeted by this drug? (B) Voltage-gated sodium channels (C) Voltage-gated potassium channels (E) Voltage-gated chloride channels (D) Voltage-gated calcium channels (A) Voltage-gated nonselective cation channels
Reason: The most likely targeted ion channels by the antiarrhythmic drug in this scenario are voltage-gated potassium channels. The absence of P waves and irregular RR intervals on the ECG suggests the patient has atrial fibrillation, where effective rate control often includes the manipulation of repolarization via potassium channel blockers, which help to stabilize the cardiac action potential and decrease the propensity for arrhythmias by prolonging the refractory period in the atria. This mechanism is crucial in managing irregular heart rates effectively.
Answer: (C) Voltage-gated potassium channels

Question: In a healthy patient with no renal abnormalities, several mechanisms are responsible for moving various filtered substances into and out of the tubules. Para-aminohippurate (PAH) is frequently used to estimate renal blood flow when maintained at low plasma concentrations. The following table illustrates the effect of changing plasma PAH concentrations on PAH excretion:
Plasma PAH concentration (mg/dL) Urinary PAH concentration (mg/dL)
0 0
10 60
20 120
30 150
40 180
Which of the following mechanisms best explains the decrease in PAH excretion with the increase in plasma concentration greater than 20 mg/dL? (D) Increased flow rate of tubular contents (B) Increased diffusion rate of PAH (E) Increased rate of PAH reabsorption (A) Saturation of PAH transport carriers (C) Decreased glomerular filtration of PAH
Reason: The decrease in PAH excretion with increasing plasma concentrations above 20 mg/dL can be explained by the saturation of PAH transport carriers. At higher concentrations of PAH, the transport systems responsible for its secretion into the renal tubules become overwhelmed, leading to a reduced excretion rate despite higher plasma levels, as the maximum capacity of the transporters has been reached. This demonstrates the concept of transporter saturation, where a further increase in substrate concentration does not proportionally increase the rate of secretion.
Answer: (A) Saturation of PAH transport carriers

Question: An investigator is studying the activity of N-terminal peptidase in eukaryotes. Sulfur-containing amino acids are radiolabeled and isolated using 35S. During translation of a non-mitochondrial human genome, some of the radiolabeled amino acids bind to the aminoacyl, peptidyl, and exit sites of a eukaryotic ribosome but others bind only to the peptidyl and exit sites. Only the radiolabeled amino acids that do not bind to the ribosomal aminoacyl-site can be excised by the N-terminal peptidase. Which of the following best describes the anticodon sequence of the transfer RNA charged by the amino acid target of the N-terminal peptidase? (C) 5'-ACA-3' (E) 5'-UAC-3' (D) 5'-ACU-3' (B) 5'-CAU-3' (A) 5'-UCA-3'
Reason: The reason the answer is (B) 5'-CAU-3' stems from the understanding of the genetic code and the process of translation. The anticodon of transfer RNA (tRNA) pairs with the codon on the messenger RNA (mRNA) during protein synthesis, and the amino acid attached to the tRNA corresponds with the codon it recognizes. In this case, the N-terminal peptidase's activity suggests that the amino acid sequences that it can excise correspond to those recognized by the specific tRNA anticodon that matches with a codon coding for a sulfur-containing amino acid, which is represented by the anticodon 5'-CAU-3' for methionine or cysteine.
Answer: (B) 5'-CAU-3'

Question: A 26-year-old woman comes to the emergency department 30 minutes after she was bitten by her neighbor's cat. She has no history of serious illness and takes no medications. She received all recommended immunizations during childhood but has not received any since then. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows four puncture wounds on the thenar eminence of the right hand. There is mild swelling but no erythema. There is normal range of motion of her right thumb and wrist. The wound is cleaned with povidone iodine and irrigated with saline. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? (A) Obtain a wound culture (E) Administer tetanus toxoid and tetanus IV immunoglobulin (C) Close the wound surgically (B) Administer oral amoxicillin-clavulanate (D) Close the wound with cyanoacrylate tissue adhesive
Reason: The answer is (B) Administer oral amoxicillin-clavulanate because cat bites have a high risk of infection, particularly from *Pasteurella multocida*, which is commonly found in saliva. Given the nature of the wound, antibiotic prophylaxis is warranted to prevent infection, and amoxicillin-clavulanate is effective against the bacteria typically associated with cat bites.
Answer: (B) Administer oral amoxicillin-clavulanate

Question: A 59-year-old man is brought to the emergency department one hour after developing shortness of breath and “squeezing” chest pain that began while he was mowing the lawn. He has asthma, hypertension, and erectile dysfunction. Current medications include salmeterol, amlodipine, lisinopril, and vardenafil. His pulse is 110/min and blood pressure is 122/70 mm Hg. Physical examination shows diaphoresis. An ECG shows sinus tachycardia. Sublingual nitroglycerin is administered. Five minutes later, his pulse is 137/min and his blood pressure is 78/40 mm Hg. Which of the following is the most likely mechanism of this patient's hypotension? (A) Bradykinin accumulation (C) Alpha-1 receptor antagonism (E) Decreased nitric oxide production (D) Cyclic GMP elevation (B) Calcium channel antagonism
Reason: The answer is (D) Cyclic GMP elevation because nitroglycerin acts as a vasodilator through its conversion to nitric oxide (NO), which leads to increased levels of cyclic GMP in the vascular smooth muscle. This increased cyclic GMP causes relaxation of the smooth muscle, resulting in vasodilation and a subsequent drop in blood pressure and potential hypotension, especially when combined with other medications.
Answer: (D) Cyclic GMP elevation

No significant medical conditions are noted. No medications are on record. The boy is up-to-date on all immunizations. His heart rate is 102/min, respiratory rate is 24/min, temperature is 36.5°C (101.6°F), and blood pressure is 92/65 mm Hg. The boy appears well-nourished and alert. Auscultation of the heart is without murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. An erythematous malar rash extending from the left lateral nasal region to the left medial zygomatic region is present. There is no lymphadenopathy present. A full skin examination reveals an erythematous, reticulated rash on the lower extremities (see image). Which of the following etiologic agents is responsible for the patient’s signs and symptoms? (E) Rubella virus (D) Human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) (B) Adenovirus (A) Parvovirus B19 (C) Streptococcus pyogenes
Reason: Parvovirus B19 is known to cause "fifth disease," which typically presents with a characteristic erythematous rash, including a "slapped cheek" appearance in children, alongside flu-like symptoms such as fever and a runny nose. The description of the boy's rash and previous mild respiratory symptoms aligns with this clinical presentation, making parvovirus B19 the most likely etiologic agent in this case.

Question: A 59-year-old healthy woman presents to her primary care physician’s office six weeks after undergoing an elective breast augmentation procedure in the Dominican Republic. She was told by her surgeon to establish post-operative care once back in the United States. Today she is bothered by nausea and early satiety. Her past medical history is significant only for GERD for which she takes ranitidine. Since the surgery, she has also taken an unknown opioid pain medication that was given to her by the surgeon. She reports that she has been taking approximately ten pills a day. On examination she is afebrile with normal vital signs and her surgical incisions are healing well. Her abdomen is distended and tympanitic. The patient refuses to stop her pain medicine and laxatives are not effective; what medication could be prescribed to ameliorate her gastrointestinal symptoms? (D) Naloxegol (E) Naproxen (C) Senna (A) Metoclopramide (B) Pantoprazole
Reason: Naloxegol is a peripherally acting mu-opioid receptor antagonist that is effective for treating opioid-induced constipation. In this case, the patient's significant opioid use post-surgery has likely led to constipation, resulting in nausea and early satiety; therefore, naloxegol would be an appropriate medication to alleviate her gastrointestinal symptoms.

He says his symptoms began gradually 6 months ago and have progressively worsened and have begun to interfere with his job as a computer programmer. He is also bothered by episodes of paralysis upon waking from naps and reports visual hallucinations when falling asleep at night. He has been under the care of another physician for the past several months, who prescribed him the standard pharmacotherapy for his most likely diagnosis. However, he has continued to experience an incomplete remission of symptoms and has been advised against increasing the dose of his current medication because of an increased risk of adverse effects. Which of the following side effects is most closely associated with the standard drug treatment for this patient’s most likely diagnosis? (B) Loss of concentration, memory impairment (D) Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (E) Weight gain and metabolic syndrome (A) Cardiac irregularities, nervousness, hallucinations (C) Parkinsonism and tardive dyskinesia
Reason: The patient's symptoms—fatigue, daytime sleepiness, paralysis upon waking, and visual hallucinations—are indicative of narcolepsy. The standard pharmacotherapy for narcolepsy often involves stimulants or medications that can have side effects, including cardiac irregularities, nervousness, and hallucinations. These side effects are notable risks associated with certain stimulant medications used in managing narcolepsy, reinforcing their association with the treatment option in question.

Question: A 27-year-old man with seizure disorder is brought to the emergency department by his girlfriend after falling while climbing a building. The girlfriend reports that he was started on a new medication for treatment of depressed mood, low energy, and difficulty sleeping 2 weeks ago by his physician. She says that he has had unstable emotions for several months. Over the past 3 days, he has not slept and has spent all his time “training to climb Everest.” He has never climbed before this period. He also spent all of his savings buying mountain climbing gear. Physical examination shows ecchymoses over his right upper extremity, pressured speech, and easy distractibility. He is alert but not oriented to place. Which of the following drugs is the most likely cause of this patient's current behavior? (D) Venlafaxine (E) Selegiline (A) Lithium (B) Quetiapine (C) Bupropion
Reason: The patient's symptoms, including unstable emotions, pressured speech, and significant impulsivity (spending all his savings), suggest a manic episode, which can occur as a result of certain antidepressants. Venlafaxine, particularly at higher doses, is known to potentially induce hypomanic or manic episodes in susceptible individuals, especially those with a predisposition to bipolar disorder, such as this patient with a history of unstable emotions. This, coupled with his recent start on the medication, aligns with the onset of his manic behavior.

He was recently diagnosed with new bone and brain metastases despite receiving aggressive chemotherapy but has not disclosed this to his wife. He has given verbal consent to discuss his prognosis with his wife and asks the doctor to inform her of his condition because he does not wish to do so himself. She is tearful and has many questions about his condition. Which of the following would be the most appropriate statement by the physician to begin the interview with the patient's wife? (E) """Why do you think your husband has not discussed his medical condition with you?""" (A) """What is your understanding of your husband's current condition?""" (C) """We should talk about how we can manage his symptoms with additional chemotherapy.""" (D) """Your husband has end-stage cancer, and his prognosis is poor.""" (B) """Have you discussed a living will or goals of care together?"""
Reason: The reason for selecting option (A) is that it allows the physician to gauge the wife's awareness and understanding of her husband's condition before providing further details. This approach fosters open communication, enabling the physician to tailor the conversation based on her knowledge and emotional state, ultimately facilitating a more supportive dialogue.
Answer: (A) """What is your understanding of your husband's current condition?"""

Question: A 32-year-old woman presents to the emergency department due to severe, intractable headaches, and bilateral ocular pain. Her symptoms began approximately 2 weeks prior to presentation and have progressively worsened. She initially had right-sided headaches that were sharp, interfered with sleep, and were unresponsive to pain medications. The headache was around her right eye and cheek, and she noticed diplopia with right lateral gaze. Her symptoms were accompanied by fatigue, fever, and edema around the right eye. Approximately 2 days after these symptoms, she developed swelling around the left eye. Medical history is significant for a recent rhinosinusitis infection. Her temperature is 101°F (38.3°C), blood pressure is 133/72 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, and respirations are 18/min. On physical exam, there is ptosis, proptosis, chemosis, and periorbital swelling of both eyes. There is hyperesthesia in the bilateral ophthalmic and maxillary divisions of the trigeminal nerve. Fundoscopic exam demonstrates bilateral papilledema. There is mydriasis and eye muscle weakness in all directions. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? (A) Acute angle-closure glaucoma (B) Bacterial endophthalmitis (D) Orbital cellulitis (E) Preseptal cellulitis (C) Cavernous sinus thrombosis
Reason: The rationale for selecting option (C) is that the patient's symptoms, including severe headaches, bilateral ocular pain, fever, and the presence of proptosis, chemosis, and ocular nerve involvement (ptosis, mydriasis, and ocular muscle weakness), suggest an infection or thrombosis affecting the cavernous sinus. The recent history of rhinosinusitis further points to a potential source of infection that could lead to cavernous sinus thrombosis, which is characterized by similar ocular signs and symptoms.
Answer: (C) Cavernous sinus thrombosis

Question: A 16-year-old girl presents with a sore throat. The patient says symptoms onset acutely 3 days ago and have progressively worsened. She denies any history of cough, nasal congestion or rhinorrhea. No significant past medical history or current medications. The vital signs include: temperature 37.7°C (99.9°F), blood pressure 110/70 mm Hg, pulse 74/min, respiratory rate 20/min, and oxygen saturation 99% on room air. Physical examination is significant for anterior cervical lymphadenopathy. There is edema of the oropharynx and tonsillar swelling but no tonsillar exudate. Which of the following is the next best step in management? (D) Empiric treatment with antibiotics (E) Empiric treatment with antivirals (B) Rapid strep test (C) Ultrasound of the anterior cervical lymph nodes (A) Reassurance
Reason: The rationale for choosing option (B) is that the patient's symptoms of sore throat, anterior cervical lymphadenopathy, and tonsillar swelling, without exudate, suggest a possible case of streptococcal pharyngitis. Conducting a rapid strep test is the appropriate next step to confirm the diagnosis of streptococcal infection before deciding on antibiotic treatment. This approach helps ensure appropriate management and reduces unnecessary antibiotic use if the test is negative.
Answer: (B) Rapid strep test

Question: A 28-year-old woman comes to the doctor with a sudden onset of edematous and hyperemic circular skin lesions all over her body. The lesions are not painful but are pruritic. She also complains of severe genital pruritus. The patient also reports that she ate peanut butter 15–20 minutes before the onset of symptoms. Her blood pressure is 118/76 mm Hg, heart rate is 78 beats per minute, and respiratory rate is 15 breaths per minute. Physical examination reveals clear lung sounds bilaterally with no signs of respiratory distress. What should be the suggested treatment? (E) Acyclovir (C) Corticosteroids (B) No medications, just observation (A) One of the beta-lactam antibiotics (D) H1 receptor antagonists
Reason: The suggested treatment for this patient is (D) H1 receptor antagonists because her symptoms, which include sudden onset of pruritic skin lesions and genital pruritus following the ingestion of peanut butter, strongly suggest an allergic reaction or urticaria (hives). H1 receptor antagonists are effective in managing allergic symptoms by blocking histamine, which is released during allergic responses.
Answer: (D) H1 receptor antagonists

Question: A 78-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by ambulance 30 minutes after the sudden onset of speech difficulties and right-sided arm and leg weakness. Examination shows paralysis and hypoesthesia on the right side, positive Babinski sign on the right, and slurred speech. A CT scan of the head shows a hyperdensity in the left middle cerebral artery and no evidence of intracranial bleeding. The patient's symptoms improve rapidly after pharmacotherapy is initiated and his weakness completely resolves. Which of the following drugs was most likely administered? (A) Rivaroxaban (D) Prasugrel (C) Heparin (E) Warfarin
" (B) Alteplase
Reason: The most likely drug administered is (B) Alteplase because the patient exhibits classic signs of an acute ischemic stroke, characterized by sudden onset neurological deficits and improvement after treatment. Alteplase is a thrombolytic agent used to dissolve blood clots in the context of an ischemic stroke, which aligns with the rapid resolution of his symptoms following pharmacotherapy.
Answer: (B) Alteplase

Question: A 46-year-old woman comes to the clinic complaining of right eye irritation. The eye is itchy and red. Discomfort has been relatively constant for the last 6 months, and nothing makes it better or worse. Past medical history is significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and aggressive tooth decay, requiring several root canals and the removal and replacement of several teeth. She takes chlorthalidone, fluvastatin, and daily ibuprofen for tooth pain. She has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily since the age of 20 and drinks alcohol on the weekends. She does not use illicit drugs. She cannot provide any family history as she was adopted. Her temperature is 36.7°C (98°F), blood pressure is 135/65 mm Hg, pulse is 82/min, respiratory rate is 15/min, and BMI is 27 kg/m2. A thorough eye exam is performed and shows no foreign objects. Both eyes appear erythematous and infected. Schirmer test is abnormal.

Complete blood count:
Hemoglobin    9.5 g/dL
Leukocytes 12,500/mm3
Platelets 155,000/mm3
ESR   60 mm/hr
Antinuclear antibody Positive
What is the best next step in the management of this patient? (A) Artificial tears (C) Erythromycin ointment (B) Fundoscopy (E) Homatropine eye drops (D) Retinoscopy
Reason: The best next step in the management of this patient is (A) Artificial tears because the symptoms indicate chronic eye irritation likely associated with dry eye syndrome, which can be exacerbated by her medical history and lifestyle. The Schirmer test being abnormal suggests reduced tear production, so artificial tears would provide symptomatic relief by lubricating the ocular surface.
Answer: (A) Artificial tears

Question: A 28-year-old man presents to his primary care provider because of shortness of breath, cough, and wheezing. He reports that in high school, he occasionally had shortness of breath and would wheeze after running. His symptoms have progressively worsened over the past 6 months and are now occurring daily. He also finds himself being woken up from sleep by his wheeze approximately 3 times a week. His medical history is unremarkable. He denies tobacco use or excessive alcohol consumption. His temperature is 37.1°C (98.8°F), blood pressure is 121/82 mm Hg, and heart rate is 82/min. Physical examination is remarkable for expiratory wheezing bilaterally. Spirometry shows an FEV1 of 73% of predicted, which improves by 19% with albuterol. In addition to a short-acting beta-agonist as needed, which of the following is the most appropriate therapy for this patient? (D) A medium-dose inhaled corticosteroid and a long-acting beta-agonist (A) A low-dose inhaled corticosteroid alone (B) A long-acting beta-agonist alone (E) A high-dose inhaled corticosteroid and a long-acting beta-agonist (C) A low-dose inhaled corticosteroid and a long-acting beta-agonist
Reason: The patient's symptoms and spirometry results are indicative of asthma, characterized by airway obstruction that improves with bronchodilation (evidenced by the improvement in FEV1 after albuterol). Given that he has daily symptoms and nocturnal awakenings due to wheezing, the combination of a low-dose inhaled corticosteroid with a long-acting beta-agonist is appropriate for better asthma control while minimizing potential adverse effects associated with higher steroid doses.
Answer: (C) A low-dose inhaled corticosteroid and a long-acting beta-agonist

Question: A 34-year-old man presents to the emergency department with leg weakness that significantly impairs and slows down his walking ability. He has noticed that he has been getting progressively weaker over the past 3 months. He has also experienced spontaneous twitching in his arms and thighs that is becoming more frequent. On physical examination, the patient appears to have decreased muscle tone and moderate atrophy of his arm and thigh muscles. Significant thenar atrophy is noted bilaterally, and deep tendon reflexes are increased. His lower limbs have resistance to movement and feel rigid. Pupillary light and accommodation reflexes are both normal. The patient can maintain his balance upon closing his eyes. Considering this case presentation, which of the following is the likely site of the lesion? (D) Ventral posterolateral nucleus of thalamus (B) Medullary lateral fasciculus (A) Nucleus of Onuf (C) Ventral horn (E) Fasciculus gracilis
Reason: The patient's symptoms, including muscle weakness, atrophy, and fasciculations, suggest damage to the lower motor neurons, which are located in the ventral horn of the spinal cord. The increased deep tendon reflexes and rigidity indicate that the upper motor neurons may also be involved, which fits with the presentation of a lower motor neuron lesion in conjunction with an upper motor neuron lesion, providing further support for a lesion in the ventral horn.
Answer: (C) Ventral horn

Question: A 23-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by the police for impaired cognition and agitation after being struck in the head at a local nightclub. The patient refuses to respond to questions and continues to be markedly agitated. An alcoholic smell is noted. His temperature is 36.9°C (98.4°F), pulse is 104/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 148/95 mm Hg. He is confused and oriented only to person. Neurological examination shows miosis and nystagmus but is quickly aborted after the patient tries to attack several members of the care team. CT scan of the head shows no abnormalities. Ingestion of which of the following substances most likely explains this patient's symptoms? (E) Phencyclidine (D) Methamphetamine (A) Heroin (B) Alcohol (C) Lysergic acid diethylamide
Reason: The patient's symptoms, including agitation, impaired cognition, miosis (constricted pupils), and nystagmus, are characteristic of phencyclidine (PCP) intoxication. PCP is known to cause severe agitation and psychosis, along with distinctive eye signs such as nystagmus, which fits the clinical picture presented in this case. The presence of an alcoholic smell might mislead to assume alcohol intoxication; however, the combination of the autonomic signs and altered mental state points more specifically towards PCP.
Answer: (E) Phencyclidine

Question: A 12-year-old boy is brought by his father to a pediatrician for evaluation of stiff jaw and swallowing difficulty. He has also developed painful body spasms triggered by loud noise, light, and physical touch. His father says that a few days ago, his son continued to play football, even after falling and bruising his arms and knees. On examination, the boy had a sustained facial smile, stiff arched back, and clamped hands. The toxin responsible for these clinical manifestations that travel retrograde in axons of peripheral motor neurons blocks the release of which of the following?
  (D) Glutamate (E) Acetylcholine (C) GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) (A) Norepinephrine (B) Serotonin
Reason: The symptoms described in the boy, including stiff jaw, difficulty swallowing, facial spasms, and the sustained smile, are indicative of tetanus, which is caused by a toxin that affects neurotransmitter release. The toxin inhibits the release of GABA, a key inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, leading to the characteristic muscle rigidity and spasms observed in these patients.
Answer: (C) GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid)

Question: A 49-year-old male complains of abdominal discomfort that worsens following meals. A gastric biopsy reveals a 2 cm gastric ulcer, and immunohistochemical staining demonstrates the presence of a rod-shaped bacterium in the gastric mucosa. Which of the following is used by the infiltrating pathogen to neutralize gastric acidity? (D) Urease (C) Bismuth (E) LT toxin (B) Mucinase (A) Flagella
Reason: The presence of a rod-shaped bacterium in the gastric mucosa suggests an infection with Helicobacter pylori, which is known to be associated with gastric ulcers. Urease is an enzyme produced by H. pylori that hydrolyzes urea to ammonia, which helps neutralize gastric acid, thereby enabling the bacteria to survive in the acidic environment of the stomach.
Answer: (D) Urease

Question: A 9-year-old girl is brought to the emergency department with a headache and double vision 1 hour after being hit on the head while playing with a friend. Her friend's elbow struck her head, just above her left ear. She did not lose consciousness, but her mother reports that she was confused for 20 minutes after the incident and did not recall being hit. She appears healthy. She is alert and oriented to person, place, and time. Her temperature is 37.2°C (99°F), pulse is 86/min, respirations are 15/min, and blood pressure is 118/78 mmHg. Examination shows the head tilted toward the right shoulder. A photograph of the eyes at primary gaze is shown. There is mild tenderness to palpation over the left temporal bone. Visual acuity is 20/20 in both eyes when tested independently. The patient's left eye hypertropia worsens with right gaze and when the patient tilts her head toward her left shoulder. The pupils are equal and reactive to light. Muscle strength and sensation are intact bilaterally. Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Plantar reflex shows a flexor response. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's ocular symptoms? (D) Medial longitudinal fasciculus damage (E) Dorsal midbrain damage (A) Oculomotor nerve damage (B) Retrobulbar hemorrhage (C) Trochlear nerve damage
Reason: The clinical presentation of the 9-year-old girl includes double vision (diplopia) and ocular misalignment characterized by left eye hypertropia that worsens with right gaze and head tilt towards the left shoulder, which suggests a problem with eye movement coordination. The trochlear nerve (cranial nerve IV) innervates the superior oblique muscle, which primarily controls downward and inward eye movement; damage to this nerve leads to hypertropia of the affected eye and is consistent with her symptoms, especially after the head trauma she experienced.
Answer: (C) Trochlear nerve damage

Path 1: Let's analyze the information provided step by step.

The stillborn infant exhibits several significant physical abnormalities: a small pelvis, shallow intergluteal cleft, club feet, and most notably, the absence of the sacrum and lumbar vertebrae. These findings are suggestive of a severe form of spinal deformity, such as caudal regression syndrome or sacral agenesis.

Now, we need to determine the strongest predisposing factor related to this condition. 

1. **Maternal diabetes (D)** is known to be associated with various fetal anomalies, including caudal regression syndrome. It can lead to significant developmental issues, particularly in the lower body.

2. **Chromosome 18 trisomy (E)** and **Chromosome 13 trisomy (C)** are associated with other congenital anomalies but are not specifically linked to the described skeletal deficiencies.

3. **Maternal oligohydramnios (A)** can cause issues in fetal development, particularly related to limb and facial deformities, but it is not the strongest link to the specific spinal abnormalities described.

4. **Intrauterine alcohol exposure (B)** can lead to fetal alcohol syndrome, which is associated with a range of developmental anomalies but is not directly related to the specific skeletal findings observed in this case.

Given the options, **maternal diabetes (D)** is the most relevant predisposing factor for the condition presented, as it is strongly associated with caudal regression syndrome and similar malformations.

**Answer: (D) Maternal diabetes**
Path 2: Let's analyze the details given in the case step by step.

1. **Stillborn infant with specific features:** The infant is described as stillborn with a small pelvis, shallow intergluteal cleft, and club feet. The X-ray findings show the absence of the sacrum and lumbar vertebrae.

2. **Interpretation of findings:** The combination of a small pelvis, club feet, and the absence of sacral and lumbar vertebrae suggests a condition related to abnormal development of the spine and possibly the lower limbs. This presentation is quite consistent with a condition known as **sacral agenesis** or **caudal regression syndrome**.

3. **Predisposing factors:** 
   - **Maternal diabetes** is known to be associated with various congenital malformations, especially those involving the spine and lower limbs.
   - **Maternal oligohydramnios** can lead to fetal deformities due to decreased amniotic fluid, but it is typically a consequence of other conditions rather than a direct cause.
   - **Intrauterine alcohol exposure** is known to cause a range of fetal abnormalities, but the specific features here point more towards structural spine issues.
   - **Chromosomal abnormalities** like trisomy 18 and trisomy 13 typically present with a different set of anomalies.

4. **Conclusion:** The strongest predisposing factor for the condition described (sacral agenesis/caudal regression syndrome) is maternal diabetes, which is commonly associated with the development of such spinal defects.

Thus, the answer is:
**(D) Maternal diabetes**
Path 3: Let's analyze the situation step by step. 

The findings of the stillborn infant, including a small pelvis, shallow intergluteal cleft, club feet, and the x-ray showing the absence of the sacrum and lumbar vertebrae, suggest a diagnosis of sacral agenesis or caudal regression syndrome. This condition is often associated with maternal factors, particularly maternal diabetes.

1. **Maternal diabetes** is a well-known risk factor for congenital malformations, including spinal defects and lower limb deformities. 
2. **Maternal oligohydramnios** can contribute to limb deformities and facial deformities but is not as strongly associated with the specific findings presented in this case.
3. **Intrauterine alcohol exposure** can lead to fetal alcohol syndrome, which has different characteristic findings and does not typically cause the specific skeletal abnormalities noted here.
4. **Chromosome abnormalities** such as trisomy 18 or trisomy 13 can lead to multiple congenital defects but the specific pattern observed in this case aligns more closely with maternal diabetes.

Given the association of maternal diabetes with the described findings, the strongest predisposing factor for this patient's condition is:

**Answer: (D) Maternal diabetes**
Path 4: Let's analyze the clinical scenario step by step. The stillborn infant shows signs of significant spinal and skeletal abnormalities, including the absence of the sacrum and lumbar vertebrae, a small pelvis, shallow intergluteal cleft, and club feet. These findings are highly suggestive of a condition known as caudal regression syndrome (CRS), which is often associated with maternal diabetes but can also be linked to oligohydramnios.

However, maternal diabetes is a well-known risk factor for congenital anomalies, including those affecting the spine and limbs. While oligohydramnios can also lead to similar outcomes (such as clubfoot and other deformities due to compression), maternal diabetes is strongly correlated with the types of anomalies observed in this case.

Considering these points, the strongest predisposing factor for this infant's condition is:

**Answer: (D) Maternal diabetes**
Path 5: Let's analyze the information step by step.

The clinical presentation suggests a case of **sacral agenesis** or **caudal regression syndrome**, which is characterized by the absence of sacral and lumbar vertebrae, and the associated physical findings like a small pelvis and club feet.

Among the options given, the strongest predisposing factor for sacral agenesis is **maternal oligohydramnios** (Option A). Oligohydramnios can lead to developmental issues, including clubfoot and other limb deformities, as well as the absence of structures in the lower spine due to compression in utero, which may contribute to the observed findings.

Other options:
- Maternal diabetes (D) is associated with defects but not specifically with sacral agenesis.
- Chromosome 18 trisomy (E) and Chromosome 13 trisomy (C) have different associations and do not primarily cause this condition.
- Intrauterine alcohol exposure (B) can lead to a spectrum of defects but is less specifically tied to the absence of the sacrum and lumbar vertebrae.

Therefore, the answer is:

**(A) Maternal oligohydramnios**
Path 6: Let's analyze the information step by step. 

The stillborn infant exhibits several significant abnormalities: a small pelvis, shallow intergluteal cleft, club feet, and the absence of the sacrum and lumbar vertebrae. These findings suggest a condition known as caudal regression syndrome or sacral agenesis, which is often associated with maternal factors.

Among the options provided, the most significant predisposing factor for caudal regression syndrome is (A) Maternal oligohydramnios. Oligohydramnios (low amniotic fluid) can lead to compression of the fetus and developmental issues, including limb and spinal abnormalities.

Other options like maternal diabetes, chromosomal abnormalities, and intrauterine alcohol exposure are associated with various congenital anomalies but are less specifically linked to the findings described in this case.

Therefore, the strongest predisposing factor for this patient's condition is:

**Answer: (A) Maternal oligohydramnios**
Path 7: Let's analyze the question step by step. The case describes a stillborn infant with specific physical findings: a small pelvis, shallow intergluteal cleft, club feet, and significant spinal anomalies (absence of the sacrum and lumbar vertebrae). These findings suggest a condition that affects the development of the spine and lower extremities.

Among the options provided:
- **Maternal diabetes** (D) is associated with various congenital anomalies but not specifically with the findings described.
- **Chromosome 18 trisomy** (E) is associated with several clinical features but does not specifically correlate with the skeletal anomalies noted.
- **Maternal oligohydramnios** (A) can lead to underdeveloped lungs and limbs (as seen in conditions like Potter's sequence), but it is not a direct cause of the specific spinal and limb anomalies described.
- **Intrauterine alcohol exposure** (B) is associated with fetal alcohol syndrome, which can cause limb deformities and craniofacial anomalies but does not directly explain the skeletal findings.
- **Chromosome 13 trisomy** (C) is associated with Patau syndrome, which can lead to various malformations, but again does not specifically explain the findings.

Given the presentation, the absence of lumbar vertebrae and sacrum, along with the club feet and shallow intergluteal cleft, suggests a defect related to embryonic development of the spine and lower limbs. 

**Maternal oligohydramnios (A)** is the most relevant option as it can lead to fetal deformities including limb deformities and spinal dysgenesis due to compression in utero, commonly seen in conditions associated with oligohydramnios like congenital abnormalities.

Thus, the strongest predisposing factor for this patient's condition is:
**Answer: (A) Maternal oligohydramnios**
Path 8: Let's analyze the details of the case step by step.

The stillborn infant presents with significant congenital abnormalities, including:
- A small pelvis
- Shallow intergluteal cleft
- Club feet
- Absence of the sacrum and lumbar vertebrae on X-ray

These findings suggest a condition known as caudal regression syndrome, which is associated with various developmental anomalies of the lower spine and associated structures.

Now, let's consider the options:
- (D) Maternal diabetes: This condition is a well-known risk factor for congenital anomalies, including caudal regression syndrome.
- (E) Chromosome 18 trisomy: This is not specifically associated with the findings described.
- (A) Maternal oligohydramnios: This can lead to various complications, but it is not the primary factor linked to the findings here.
- (B) Intrauterine alcohol exposure: This can cause fetal alcohol syndrome, but it does not specifically cause the spinal anomalies noted.
- (C) Chromosome 13 trisomy: Similar to option E, this is not specifically linked to the described anomalies.

Given that maternal diabetes is strongly associated with caudal regression syndrome and other congenital anomalies, it is the strongest predisposing factor among the options provided.

Therefore, the answer is: (D) Maternal diabetes.
Path 9: Let's analyze the information step by step. The stillborn infant has several significant physical findings: a small pelvis, shallow intergluteal cleft, club feet, and the absence of the sacrum and lumbar vertebrae, which are indicative of a serious congenital anomaly, likely due to a condition such as sacral agenesis or caudal regression syndrome.

Among the options provided, we need to consider which is the strongest predisposing factor for this condition:

- **(D) Maternal diabetes**: This is a well-known risk factor for congenital anomalies and could potentially lead to issues like caudal regression syndrome. 
- **(E) Chromosome 18 trisomy**: While chromosomal abnormalities can lead to multiple congenital anomalies, they are less specifically associated with the findings described.
- **(A) Maternal oligohydramnios**: Oligohydramnios can cause issues with fetal development, particularly in the musculoskeletal system, but it is not the most direct cause of the anomalies presented.
- **(B) Intrauterine alcohol exposure**: Alcohol exposure in utero can lead to a range of developmental disorders, including fetal alcohol syndrome, but is not directly linked to the specific findings of spinal anomalies.
- **(C) Chromosome 13 trisomy**: Similar to trisomy 18, it could cause various anomalies but is not particularly associated with the findings here.

Given the context, maternal diabetes is known to be a strong risk factor for congenital malformations, particularly those involving the spine and lower extremities. Thus, the strongest predisposing factor for this patient's condition is:

**Answer: (D) Maternal diabetes**
Path 10: Let's analyze the situation step by step.

The clinical features described—stillbirth, small pelvis, shallow intergluteal cleft, club feet, and absence of the sacrum and lumbar vertebrae—are suggestive of a condition known as caudal regression syndrome or sacral agenesis. This condition is often associated with maternal factors that influence fetal development.

Among the options provided:

- (D) Maternal diabetes: This is a well-known risk factor for caudal regression syndrome. Infants born to mothers with diabetes are at increased risk for a variety of congenital anomalies, including those affecting the lower spine and limbs.
- (E) Chromosome 18 trisomy and (C) Chromosome 13 trisomy: While these chromosomal abnormalities can lead to congenital anomalies, they are not specifically linked to the features described.
- (A) Maternal oligohydramnios: This can lead to various developmental issues due to compression but is not the strongest predisposing factor related to this specific condition.
- (B) Intrauterine alcohol exposure: This is associated with fetal alcohol syndrome and other anomalies, but not specifically with the features described.

Given the evidence, the strongest predisposing factor for the described condition in this case is (D) Maternal diabetes.

Question: A 50-year-old woman presents with a severe headache and vomiting. She says that symptoms onset after attending a wine tasting at the local brewery. She says that her headache is mostly at the back of her head and that she has been nauseous and vomited twice. Past medical history is significant for depression diagnosed 20 years ago but now well-controlled with medication. She also has significant vitamin D deficiency. Current medications are phenelzine and a vitamin D supplement. The patient denies any smoking history, alcohol or recreational drug use. On physical examination, the patient is diaphoretic. Her pupils are dilated. Which of the following is most likely to be elevated in this patient? (C) Creatine phosphokinase (E) Aspartate aminotransferase (D) Blood pressure (A) Serum creatinine (B) Temperature
Reason: The patient's symptoms, including a severe headache, sweating, and dilated pupils, could suggest a hypertensive crisis, potentially due to the interaction of her medication (phenelzine, an MAOI) with tyramine-rich foods, such as those she may have consumed at the wine tasting. This kind of crisis would commonly lead to elevated blood pressure as a physiological response to the exacerbating factors.
Answer: (D) Blood pressure

Question: A 5-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his parents because of a 4-day history of arthralgias, abdominal pain, and lesions on his arms and legs. Ten days ago, he had an upper respiratory tract infection. A photograph of one of his legs is shown. Further evaluation is most likely to show which of the following? (A) Genital ulcers (C) Tick bite (D) Conjunctivitis (B) Hematuria (E) Thrombocytopenia
Reason: The presentation of arthralgias, abdominal pain, and skin lesions in conjunction with a recent upper respiratory infection raises suspicion for a condition like Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP), which is characterized by a classic tetrad of symptoms including rash, arthralgia, abdominal pain, and renal involvement. Hematuria is a common finding in HSP due to the deposition of immune complexes in the kidneys, causing glomerulonephritis.

Question: A 32-year-old primigravida at 35 weeks gestation seeks evaluation at the emergency department for swelling and redness of the left calf, which started 2 hours ago. She reports that the pain has worsened since the onset. The patient denies a history of insect bites or trauma. She has never experienced something like this in the past. Her pregnancy has been uneventful so far. She does not use alcohol, tobacco, or any illicit drugs. She does not take any medications other than prenatal vitamins. Her temperature is 36.8℃ (98.2℉), the blood pressure is 105/60 mm Hg, the pulse is 110/min, and the respirations are 15/min. The left calf is edematous with the presence of erythema. The skin feels warm and pain is elicited with passive dorsiflexion of the foot. The femoral, popliteal, and pedal pulses are palpable bilaterally. An abdominal examination reveals a fundal height consistent with the gestational age. The lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. The patient is admitted to the hospital and appropriate treatment is initiated. Which of the following hormones is most likely implicated in the development of this patient’s condition? (C) Human chorionic gonadotropin (B) Progesterone (A) Estriol (E) Prolactin (D) Human placental lactogen
Reason: The answer to the question regarding the hormone most likely implicated in the development of this patient’s condition is (A) Estriol. 

Estriol is a hormone produced during pregnancy that can lead to vascular changes, including increased blood flow and certain physiological adaptations. These changes can contribute to the development of conditions such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which is suggested by the patient's symptoms of swelling, redness, and pain in the left calf.
Answer: (A) Estriol

Question: A 62-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of progressive shortness of breath, mild chest pain on exertion, and a cough for 2 days. One week ago, he had a low-grade fever and nasal congestion. He has hypertension but does not adhere to his medication regimen. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 30 years and drinks 3–4 beers daily. His temperature is 37.1°C (98.8°F), pulse is 125/min, respirations are 29/min, and blood pressure is 145/86 mm Hg. He is in moderate respiratory distress while sitting. Pulmonary examination shows reduced breath sounds bilaterally. There is scattered wheezing over all lung fields. There is inward displacement of his abdomen during inspiration. Arterial blood gas analysis shows:
pH 7.29
PCO2 63 mm Hg
PO2 71 mm Hg
HCO3- 29 mEq/L
O2 saturation 89%
Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?" (D) Acute decompensatation of congestive heart failure (B) Acute pulmonary embolism (A) Acute asthma exacerbation (C) Acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (E) Acute respiratory distress syndrome
Reason: The answer to the question is (C) Acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient's history of long-term smoking, as well as his symptoms of progressive shortness of breath, wheezing, and respiratory distress, suggest that an acute exacerbation of COPD is the underlying cause. The arterial blood gas analysis shows respiratory acidosis with a compensatory metabolic alkalosis, which is consistent with chronic respiratory disease where CO2 retention occurs, further supporting the diagnosis of an acute exacerbation of COPD.

Question: A 19-year-old man comes to the physician for evaluation of night sweats, pruritus, and enlarging masses in his right axilla and supraclavicular area for 2 weeks. Physical examination shows painless, rubbery lymphadenopathy in the right axillary, supraclavicular, and submental regions. An excisional biopsy of an axillary node is performed. If present, which of the following features would be most concerning for a neoplastic process? (E) Predominance of histiocytes in the medullary sinuses (A) Polyclonal proliferation of lymphocytes with a single nucleus (C) Positive staining of the paracortex for cluster of differentiation 8 (B) Preponderance of lymphocytes with a single immunoglobulin variable domain allele (D) Diffuse mitotic activity in secondary follicles
Reason: The answer to the question is (B) Preponderance of lymphocytes with a single immunoglobulin variable domain allele. This finding is concerning for a neoplastic process because it indicates a clonal proliferation of lymphocytes, which is characteristic of malignancies, such as lymphomas, where a single lineage of cells is expanded, suggesting uncontrolled growth rather than a reactive, benign process. The presence of a single immunoglobulin variable domain allele suggests that the lymphocytes are derived from a single precursor cell, a hallmark of neoplastic transformation.
Answer: (B) Preponderance of lymphocytes with a single immunoglobulin variable domain allele

Question: A 45-year-old man presents to the physician with limb weakness over the last 24 hours. He is an otherwise healthy man with no significant past medical history. On physical examination, his vital signs are stable. On neurological examination, there is decreased strength in the muscles of all 4 extremities, and the deep tendon reflexes are depressed. A detailed laboratory evaluation shows that he has generalized decreased neuronal excitability due to an electrolyte imbalance. Which of the following electrolyte imbalances is most likely to be present in the man? (A) Acute hyperkalemia (E) Acute hypochloremia (B) Acute hypercalcemia (D) Acute hypernatremia (C) Acute hypomagnesemia
Reason: The answer to the question is (B) Acute hypercalcemia. The symptoms described, such as generalized decreased neuronal excitability and limb weakness with depressed deep tendon reflexes, are indicative of hypercalcemia, as elevated calcium levels can lead to reduced neuromuscular excitability and muscle weakness. In contrast, other electrolyte disturbances like hyperkalemia or hypomagnesemia typically present with different neurological findings, and hypercalcemia is specifically known to cause a decrease in neuronal excitability, making it the most likely cause in this case.
Answer: (B) Acute hypercalcemia

Question: A 38-year-old man with a history of hypertension presents to his primary care physician for a headache and abdominal pain. His symptoms began approximately 1 week ago and have progressively worsened. He describes his headache as pressure-like and is mildly responsive to ibuprofen. His abdominal pain is located in the bilateral flank area. His hypertension is poorly managed with lifestyle modification and chlorthalidone. He had 1 urinary tract infection that was treated with ciprofloxacin approximately 6 months ago. He has a home blood pressure monitor, where his average readings are 155/95 mmHg. Family history is significant for his father expiring secondary to a myocardial infarction and his history was complicated by refractory hypertension and end-stage renal disease. His vital signs are significant for a blood pressure of 158/100 mmHg. Physical examination is notable for bilateral flank masses. Laboratory testing is significant for a creatinine of 3.1 mg/dL. Urinalysis is remarkable for hematuria and proteinuria. Which of the following will this patient most likely be at risk for developing? (E) Neuroendocrine pancreatic tumor (C) Migraine headache (D) Mitral valve prolapse (A) Epilepsy (B) Lymphangioleiomyomatosis
Reason: Upon reviewing the symptoms and family history presented in this case, particularly the patient's significant hypertension and family history of myocardial infarction, mitral valve prolapse (MVP) can be considered as it is more commonly associated with conditions of connective tissue disorders and may have a genetic predisposition. Despite this reasoning appearing somewhat tenuous in relation to the patient's specific presentation, the context of cardiovascular complications, such as MVP, could be of concern in someone with longstanding hypertension and family history of heart disease.

Question: A 55-year-old man presents to the emergency department complaining of mild vision changes, dizziness, and severe pain in the chest for the past hour. He has also been experiencing nausea since this morning and has already vomited twice. Past medical history includes poorly controlled type 2 diabetes and end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis. His blood pressure is 210/100 mm Hg, pulse is 110/min, and respirations are 18/min. Ophthalmic examination of his eyes show papilledema and flame-shaped hemorrhages and he is diagnosed with hypertensive emergency. Treatment involves rapidly lowering his blood pressure, and he is started on intravenous sodium nitroprusside while emergent dialysis is arranged. Which of the following cardiac pressure-volume loops closely represents the action of the drug he has been administered, where blue represents before administration and purple represent after administration? (B) Diagram B (D) Diagram D (C) Diagram C (A) Diagram A (E) Diagram E
Reason: To determine which cardiac pressure-volume loop represents the effects of sodium nitroprusside, we need to consider how the drug works. Sodium nitroprusside is a potent vasodilator that reduces systemic vascular resistance, leading to a decrease in afterload. This results in a shift on the pressure-volume loop, demonstrating a decrease in ventricular pressure at a given volume, typically resulting in an increased stroke volume and a potential decrease in end-systolic volume. After administration, we would expect the loop to reflect these changes, indicating a reduction in pressure without a significant change in volume, which would be represented by Diagram B.
Answer: (B) Diagram B

Question: A 32-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-week history of recurrent thumb pain that worsens with exposure to cold temperatures. Examination shows a 6-mm, blue-red papule under the left thumbnail. The overlying area is extremely tender to palpation. The thumbnail is slightly pitted and cracked. This lesion most likely developed from which of the following types of cells? (A) Dysplastic melanocytes (B) Modified smooth muscle cells (D) Injured nerve cells (E) Basal epidermal cells (C) Hyperpigmented fibroblasts
Reason: To identify the origin of the lesion described, we need to consider the characteristics and context of the lesion. The presence of a 6-mm blue-red papule under the nail, along with symptoms like cold sensitivity and tenderness, may suggest a vascular origin such as a glomus tumor, which often arises from modified smooth muscle cells associated with the glomus body. Thus, the answer points to modified smooth muscle cells as the likely source of this lesion.

Question: A 32-year-old man presents with a fever that has persisted for 3 days. He says that the fever was initially low at around 37.8°C (100.0°F), but, for the past 2 days, it has been around 38.9°C (102.0°F), regardless of his attempts to bring it down. He has also noticed some bumps on his neck. On further questioning, he mentions that he was recently out rabbit hunting with his friends. He is prescribed an antibiotic and requested to follow-up in 2 weeks. On follow-up, the patient seems better, however, he says he now has a slight hearing difficulty. What is the mechanism of action of the drug that was prescribed to this patient? (A) It binds to the 50S subunit and prevents translocation (E) It binds to the 30S subunit and prevents the formation of the initiation complex (C) It binds to the 50S subunit and prevents the formation of the initiation complex (B) It binds to the 30S subunit and prevents amino acid incorporation (D) It binds to the 50S subunit and prevents the formation of the peptide bond
Reason: The answer provided indicates that the drug prescribed to the patient, who is likely suffering from a bacterial infection, acts by inhibiting the formation of the initiation complex during protein synthesis in bacteria. This mechanism suggests that the antibiotic targets the 30S ribosomal subunit, which is crucial for the proper assembly of the machinery needed to translate mRNA into proteins, thus preventing bacterial growth and replication. Such a mechanism is characteristic of certain classes of antibiotics, particularly the aminoglycosides.
Answer: (E) It binds to the 30S subunit and prevents the formation of the initiation complex

Question: A 17-year-old girl is brought to the physician by her mother because she has not had her menstrual period yet. At birth, she had ambiguous genitalia. The mother reports that during the pregnancy she had noticed abnormal hair growth on her chin. A year ago, the girl broke her distal radius after a minor trauma. She is at the 95th percentile for height and 50th percentile for weight. Physical examination shows nodulocystic acne on the face, chest, and upper back. Breast development is at Tanner stage I. Pelvic examination reveals normal pubic hair with clitoromegaly. A pelvic ultrasound shows ovaries with multiple cysts and a normal uterus. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? (B) Kallmann syndrome (D) Mullerian agenesis (C) Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (E) Polycystic ovary syndrome (A) Aromatase deficiency
Reason: The answer refers to aromatase deficiency, which is characterized by a deficiency in the enzyme responsible for converting androgens to estrogens, leading to signs of estrogen deficiency such as absence of menstruation and underdevelopment of secondary sexual characteristics, as seen in the patient. Additionally, the presence of ambiguous genitalia and the described physical findings, including clitoromegaly and nodulocystic acne, further support the diagnosis of aromatase deficiency as it aligns with typical manifestations of altered androgen and estrogen levels in development.
Answer: (A) Aromatase deficiency

Question: A 17-year-old patient presents to the emergency department with left wrist pain after falling off of his bike and landing on his left hand. On physical exam the thenar eminence is red, swollen, and tender to palpation, so a radiograph is ordered. The patient is worried because he learned in biology class that radiography can cause cancer through damaging DNA but the physician reassures him that radiographs give a very minor dose of radiation. What is the most common mechanism by which ionizing radiation damages DNA? (D) Strand breakage (A) Thymidine dimer formation (C) Cytosine deamination (E) Cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer formation (B) Microsatellite instability
Reason: The answer points to strand breakage as the most common mechanism by which ionizing radiation damages DNA, a well-established phenomenon where high-energy radiation can directly break the DNA strands. This type of damage is particularly significant because it can lead to mutations, cellular dysfunction, and potentially cancer if not properly repaired; thus, understanding this mechanism helps underscore the importance of DNA damage response and repair systems in maintaining genomic integrity after exposure to ionizing radiation.

Question: A 41-year-old woman presents for evaluation of a mild bloody vaginal discharge for the past 4 months. Bleeding increases after sexual intercourse. For the past few weeks, the patient also began to note an unpleasant odor. The patient has a regular 28-day menstrual cycle. Her husband has been her only sexual partner for the past 15 years. She has a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine contraceptive device (IUD) that was inserted 4 years ago. She does not take oral contraceptives. She has not had a gynecologic evaluation since the IUD was placed. She is a machine operator. Her past medical history is significant for Graves’ disease with thyrotoxicosis that was treated with radioactive iodine ablation. The BMI is 22 kg/m2. The gynecologic examination shows no vulvar or vaginal lesions. The cervix is deformed and a 4-cm exophytic mass with necrotization is noted arising from the posterior lip of the cervix. The uterus is not enlarged. No masses are palpable in the adnexa. What is the most probable cause of the patient’s condition? (E) Exposure to radioactive iodine (B) Exposure to heavy metals (C) IUD complication (A) Hyperestrogenemia (D) Human papillomavirus infection
Reason: The most probable cause of the patient’s condition is (D) Human papillomavirus infection. This conclusion is supported by the presence of an exophytic mass on the cervix, which is often associated with HPV-related cervical dysplasia or malignancy, especially in women who have not had regular gynecologic evaluations. Additionally, the symptoms of bloody discharge and unpleasant odor further suggest the possibility of a cervical neoplasm, likely linked to HPV infection, given its prevalence in cervical cancer cases.

Question: A 33-year-old woman presents to the physician because of abdominal discomfort, weakness, and fever. She has had a significant weight loss of 15 kg (33.1 lb) over the past 2 months. She has no history of medical illness and is not on any medications. Her pulse is 96/min, the blood pressure is 167/92 mm Hg, the respiratory rate is 20/min, and the temperature is 37.7°C (99.8°F). Her weight is 67 kg (147.71 lb), height is 160 cm (5 ft 3 in), and BMI is 26.17 kg/m2. Abdominal examination shows purple striae and a vaguely palpable mass in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen, which does not move with respirations. She has coarse facial hair and a buffalo hump along with central obesity. Her extremities have poor muscle bulk, and muscle weakness is noted on examination. An ultrasound of the abdomen demonstrates an adrenal mass with para-aortic lymphadenopathy. Which of the following is the most likely laboratory profile in this patient? (E) Impaired glucose tolerance, elevated serum cortisol, normal 24-h urinary free cortisol, and normal plasma ACTH (C) Impaired glucose tolerance, elevated serum cortisol, elevated 24-h urinary free cortisol, and low plasma ACTH (D) Impaired glucose tolerance, reduced serum cortisol, normal 24-h urinary free cortisol, and low plasma ACTH (B) Impaired glucose tolerance, elevated serum cortisol, elevated 24-h urinary free cortisol, and high plasma ACTH (A) Normal glucose tolerance, elevated serum cortisol, normal 24-h urinary free cortisol, and normal plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)
Reason: The symptoms and examination findings in this patient are consistent with Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by excessive cortisol production. The presence of an adrenal mass and para-aortic lymphadenopathy suggests an adrenal tumor, likely secreting cortisol, leading to elevated levels of serum cortisol and 24-hour urinary free cortisol. In primary adrenal causes of Cushing's syndrome, plasma ACTH levels are typically low due to negative feedback from the high cortisol levels. Thus, the most plausible laboratory profile for this patient would be impaired glucose tolerance, elevated serum cortisol, elevated urinary free cortisol, and low plasma ACTH.
Answer: (C) Impaired glucose tolerance, elevated serum cortisol, elevated 24-h urinary free cortisol, and low plasma ACTH

The fever persisted for several days and abated just prior to appearance of the rash. Physical examination shows a rose-colored, blanching, maculopapular rash, and postauricular lymphadenopathy. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? (A) Nonbullous impetigo (B) Roseola infantum (E) Erythema infectiosum (D) Rubella (C) Drug allergy
Reason: The key clinical features in this case, including the sudden onset of a rose-colored, blanching rash that follows a high fever and persists for several days, are characteristic of Roseola infantum (sixth disease). Additionally, the postauricular lymphadenopathy and the age of the child further support this diagnosis, as Roseola is commonly caused by human herpesvirus 6 and typically occurs in children under two years old.
Answer: (B) Roseola infantum

Question: A 53-year-old man is brought to the emergency department following an episode of loss of consciousness 1 hour ago. He had just finished micturating, when he fell down. His wife heard the noise and found him unconscious on the floor. He regained consciousness after 30 seconds and was able to talk normally with his wife immediately. There was no urinary incontinence. On arrival, he is alert and oriented. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. Neurologic examination shows no focal findings. Serum concentrations of glucose, creatinine, and electrolytes are within the reference range. An electrocardiogram shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? (E) Arrhythmogenic syncope (A) Cardiovascular syncope (C) Emotional syncope (B) Situational syncope (D) Neurocardiogenic syncope
Reason: The scenario describes a loss of consciousness immediately following micturition, a situation where syncope can commonly occur due to a transient drop in blood pressure related to the act of urination. Given that the patient regained consciousness quickly, was able to converse immediately afterward, and had no significant findings on examination, this indicates a situational syncope likely triggered by the physiological response to micturition rather than other causes such as arrhythmias or emotional responses.
Answer: (B) Situational syncope

Question: A 54-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of drooping on the left side of her face since that morning. She also reports difficulty closing her eyes and chewing. During the neurologic examination, the physician asks the patient to open her jaw against resistance. Which of the following muscles is most likely activated in this movement? (E) Buccinator (D) Hyoglossus (B) Masseter (A) Lateral pterygoid (C) Orbicularis oris
Reason: In the context of the question regarding muscle activation during the action of opening the jaw, the lateral pterygoid muscle plays a pivotal role. This muscle is primarily responsible for depressing and protruding the mandible, which is essential for jaw opening against resistance, making it the most likely muscle activated during this movement.
Answer: (A) Lateral pterygoid

Question: An 80-year-old woman presents with general malaise and low-grade fever. Physical examination reveals several retinal hemorrhages with pale centers, erythematous nodules on palms that are not painful, and splinter hemorrhages under her fingernails. Echocardiogram shows vegetations on the mitral valve. Blood culture indicates gram-positive bacteria which are catalase negative and able to grow in 40% bile; however, not in 6.5% NaCl. In addition to endocarditis, the doctor is concerned that the patient may also be suffering from which of the following medical conditions? (E) Colon cancer (B) Sickle cell disease (C) Dental caries (A) Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (D) HIV/AIDS
Reason: The presence of retinal hemorrhages, non-painful erythematous nodules (suggestive of Janeway lesions), splinter hemorrhages, and the discovery of vegetations on the mitral valve strongly suggest infective endocarditis. This condition is often associated with underlying malignancies, particularly in older adults, and the fact that the patient is 80 years old raises the suspicion for colon cancer, especially considering that endocarditis can be a paraneoplastic syndrome in such patients.
Answer: (E) Colon cancer

Question: An 8-year-old boy presents with a 7-day history of fever and abdominal pain for the past 4 days. Past medical history is significant for an exchange transfusion for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia and recurrent attacks of pallor during the course of upper respiratory tract infections. His vital signs include: blood pressure 120/70 mm Hg, pulse 105/min, respiratory rate 40/min, and temperature 37.0℃ (98.6℉). On physical examination, the patient is ill-looking. Conjunctivae are pale and the sclera is icteric. The liver is palpable 2 cm below the costal margin and the spleen is palpable 3 cm below the left costal margin. Laboratory findings show hemoglobin of 5.9 gm/dL, Hct of 20%, and haptoglobin of 28 gm/dL. A peripheral blood smear shows hypochromic anemia, polychromasia, anisocytosis, and occasional Heinz bodies. The reticulocyte count was 15%. A direct Coombs test was negative. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient? (D) Gilbert syndrome (B) Glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase deficiency (C) Sickle cell disease (E) IgG mediated autoimmune hemolytic anemia (A) Hereditary spherocytosis
Reason: The clinical presentation of the 8-year-old boy, including the combination of anemia, icterus (jaundice), spleen and liver enlargement, as well as the presence of Heinz bodies on the peripheral blood smear, is indicative of hemolytic anemia. Given the negative direct Coombs test, the elevated reticulocyte count, and the history of recurrent pallor during infections, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency emerges as the most likely diagnosis, as it can lead to hemolysis triggered by oxidative stress, commonly seen with infections and certain medications or foods.
Answer: (B) Glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase deficiency
[INFO] Sampling path 10 completed.
[INFO] Opinion paths:
Path 1: Let's analyze the situation step by step. 

The patient is showing signs of significant hemodynamic instability, including hypotension (blood pressure of 85/59 mm Hg) and tachycardia (pulse of 122/min), which suggest he is likely experiencing hypovolemic shock, possibly due to gastrointestinal bleeding (indicated by bloody vomitus). 

In this context, the body will attempt to compensate for the low blood pressure and decreased perfusion by activating several physiological responses:

1. **Cardiac inotropy**: The heart will increase its force of contraction to maintain cardiac output. Thus, cardiac inotropy is likely to be increased, not decreased.
  
2. **Systemic vascular resistance**: The body typically responds to hypotension by vasoconstricting peripheral vessels, which would increase systemic vascular resistance in an effort to maintain blood pressure. So this would not be decreased.

3. **Pulmonary vascular resistance**: This is usually not significantly affected in the context of hypovolemic shock, so it is unlikely to be the answer.

4. **Carotid baroreceptor firing activity**: In response to hypotension, the firing rate of carotid baroreceptors decreases, as they sense less stretch in the arterial walls. This is because baroreceptors respond to changes in blood pressure; therefore, in a state of hypotension, their activity would be decreased.

5. **Fractional tissue oxygen extraction**: This may increase as tissues begin to extract more oxygen from the blood in response to lower blood flow, but it is not the best answer here.

Given this analysis, the most accurate answer is:
**(C) Carotid baroreceptor firing activity**.
Path 2: Let's analyze the clinical presentation and the options step by step.

The patient is a 52-year-old man with recurrent vomiting of bloody material, likely indicating upper gastrointestinal bleeding. He has a significant history of alcohol use, is hypotensive (blood pressure of 85/59 mm Hg), tachycardic (pulse of 122/min), and appears pale, indicating possible hypovolemia or shock. He also has signs of chronic liver disease, such as spider angiomata and caput medusae (distended abdomen).

Given this situation, we are looking for a physiological response that would be decreased in this patient compared to a healthy adult. 

1. **Fractional tissue oxygen extraction (B)**: This typically increases in states of hypoxia or shock as tissues extract more oxygen from the blood. This is likely not decreased.
  
2. **Carotid baroreceptor firing activity (C)**: In response to hypotension, baroreceptors in the carotid arteries would decrease their firing rate, signaling the body to increase heart rate and vascular resistance. Therefore, this would be decreased in this patient.

3. **Cardiac inotropy (E)**: Inotropy refers to the strength of the heart's contraction. In the setting of hypovolemia and shock, cardiac inotropy may be increased due to compensatory mechanisms, so this is likely not decreased.

4. **Systemic vascular resistance (A)**: In response to hypotension, systemic vascular resistance is typically increased as the body tries to maintain blood pressure.

5. **Pulmonary vascular resistance (D)**: This is generally unaffected by the acute presentation of shock and is not the focus of this case.

Given the above analysis, the best answer is:

**(C) Carotid baroreceptor firing activity**. 

This is decreased in response to the hypotension that the patient is experiencing.
Path 3: Let's analyze the situation step by step. 

The patient is showing signs of significant volume depletion or shock, evidenced by his low blood pressure (85/59 mm Hg), tachycardia (pulse 122/min), pallor, and delayed capillary refill. He has a history of heavy alcohol use, which may have led to liver disease, potentially contributing to portal hypertension and splenomegaly (indicated by the distended abdomen). The bloody vomitus suggests possible upper gastrointestinal bleeding, likely from esophageal varices due to chronic liver disease.

Given the patient's condition, we need to identify what is most likely decreased compared to a healthy adult. 

1. **Fractional tissue oxygen extraction (B)** - This would likely be increased in a patient with shock as tissues would extract more oxygen due to decreased perfusion.

2. **Carotid baroreceptor firing activity (C)** - This would be decreased due to low blood pressure (less stretch in the carotid arteries).

3. **Cardiac inotropy (E)** - This could be decreased due to potential heart failure or poor cardiac output from hypovolemia, but it is not definitive.

4. **Systemic vascular resistance (A)** - This is likely increased in response to low blood pressure, as the body attempts to compensate.

5. **Pulmonary vascular resistance (D)** - This is generally not directly affected by the systemic conditions presented here.

From this analysis, the most appropriate answer is (C) Carotid baroreceptor firing activity. In response to the low blood pressure, the firing activity of the carotid baroreceptors would indeed be decreased. 

Final Answer: (C) Carotid baroreceptor firing activity.
Path 4: Let's analyze the case step by step. 

The patient presents with signs of significant volume depletion, as indicated by hypotension (blood pressure of 85/59 mm Hg), tachycardia (pulse of 122/min), and pale appearance. His history of heavy alcohol use suggests potential liver disease, which can lead to complications such as portal hypertension and related effects.

In this context of hypotension and potential hypovolemia, the body would respond by attempting to compensate for low blood pressure through various mechanisms:

1. **Systemic Vascular Resistance (SVR)** typically increases in response to hypotension to help maintain blood pressure. Therefore, SVR is not decreased.
2. **Cardiac Inotropy** refers to the strength of heart contractions. In a state of shock, the body may have increased inotropic responses to maintain cardiac output, so this is not decreased.
3. **Carotid Baroreceptor Firing Activity** would decrease due to lower arterial pressure, as baroreceptors respond to the stretch of arterial walls. This is likely decreased due to the hypotension.
4. **Fractional Tissue Oxygen Extraction** could be increased due to reduced oxygen delivery, but this is not the focus of the question about being "most likely decreased."
5. **Pulmonary Vascular Resistance** may also change due to various factors but is less relevant in this acute scenario of shock and is not likely decreased.

Given this reasoning, the most likely option that would be decreased in response to the patient's current condition (hypotension) compared to a healthy adult is:

**Answer: (C) Carotid baroreceptor firing activity.**
Path 5: Let's analyze the situation step by step.

The patient is a 52-year-old man with a significant history of alcohol use, presenting with recurrent vomiting, bloody vomitus, signs of hypovolemia (pale appearance, low blood pressure, increased heart rate), and signs of liver disease (spider angiomata). He is likely experiencing a significant gastrointestinal bleed, possibly from esophageal varices or other upper gastrointestinal sources due to chronic liver disease and portal hypertension.

Given the nature of his presentation, we need to consider the physiological responses to his condition:

1. **Blood Pressure and Volume Status**: The patient has low blood pressure (85/59 mm Hg), which indicates hypovolemia likely from blood loss. This would lead to compensatory mechanisms to maintain blood flow to vital organs.

2. **Systemic Vascular Resistance (SVR)**: In response to hypovolemia, the body typically increases systemic vascular resistance to help maintain blood pressure and perfusion to vital organs. This would not be decreased.

3. **Carotid Baroreceptor Firing Activity**: With low blood pressure, carotid baroreceptors would have decreased firing activity, since they respond to stretch in the arterial wall. This is a potential candidate for being decreased.

4. **Fractional Tissue Oxygen Extraction**: With adequate perfusion, this would normally not decrease, as the body aims to extract sufficient oxygen from the blood even under stress conditions.

5. **Cardiac Inotropy**: In response to hypovolemia, the body typically increases cardiac inotropy (contractility) to improve cardiac output, so this would not be decreased.

6. **Pulmonary Vascular Resistance**: This is generally not directly related to systemic blood volume status and is unlikely to be decreased in this context.

Based on this analysis, the most likely option that would be decreased in this patient compared to a healthy adult would be:

**Answer**: (C) Carotid baroreceptor firing activity
Path 6: Let's analyze the information step by step.

The patient is a 52-year-old man presenting with symptoms and signs suggestive of significant volume depletion or shock, likely due to gastrointestinal bleeding from chronic alcohol use leading to liver disease (e.g., cirrhosis). His vital signs indicate hypotension (blood pressure of 85/59 mm Hg) and tachycardia (pulse of 122/min), indicating compensatory mechanisms due to decreased blood volume and perfusion.

Considering the options:

(A) **Systemic vascular resistance** - In response to hypotension and decreased blood flow, the body typically compensates by increasing systemic vascular resistance through vasoconstriction. Thus, this is likely *not* decreased.

(B) **Fractional tissue oxygen extraction** - In states of shock, tissues extract a higher fraction of available oxygen due to decreased perfusion, so this is also likely *not* decreased.

(C) **Carotid baroreceptor firing activity** - Carotid baroreceptors sense blood pressure. In a hypotensive state, the firing rate of these baroreceptors decreases, which is consistent with the body's compensatory response to low blood pressure. So, this is likely to be *decreased*.

(D) **Pulmonary vascular resistance** - This generally does not decrease in response to systemic shock.

(E) **Cardiac inotropy** - While inotropic support may be affected in the setting of shock, it is more complex and does not simply decrease in a straightforward manner.

Based on the analysis, the most likely option that is decreased in this patient compared to a healthy adult is:

**Answer: (C) Carotid baroreceptor firing activity**
Path 7: Let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. **Patient Presentation**: The 52-year-old man has recurrent vomiting with bloody vomitus and is showing signs of significant hypotension (blood pressure of 85/59 mm Hg), tachycardia (pulse of 122/min), and pallor. He has a history of heavy alcohol use, is pale, and has signs of potential liver disease (spider angiomata). His altered mental status suggests possible hepatic encephalopathy or severe dehydration.

2. **Physiological Response**: Given his hypotension and signs of shock, the body would respond by trying to maintain blood flow and oxygen delivery to vital organs. In this context, the systemic vascular resistance (SVR) would normally increase to help compensate for the low blood pressure.

3. **Evaluating the Options**:
   - **(A) Systemic vascular resistance**: In a shock state, SVR typically increases to compensate for low blood pressure.
   - **(B) Fractional tissue oxygen extraction**: This would likely increase as tissues extract more oxygen from the blood due to low blood flow.
   - **(C) Carotid baroreceptor firing activity**: This would decrease due to low blood pressure, as baroreceptors are less activated in hypotension.
   - **(D) Pulmonary vascular resistance**: This is less likely to be directly affected in this scenario.
   - **(E) Cardiac inotropy**: This may decrease initially due to poor perfusion and potential myocardial ischemia, but compensatory mechanisms typically aim to maintain cardiac output.

4. **Conclusion**: The most likely option that would be decreased in response to his current condition compared to a healthy adult is **(C) Carotid baroreceptor firing activity**. In a state of hypotension, the carotid baroreceptors would be less stimulated, resulting in decreased firing activity.

**Answer: (C) Carotid baroreceptor firing activity**
Path 8: To analyze the situation step by step:

1. **Patient Presentation**: The patient is a 52-year-old man with a history of heavy alcohol consumption, presenting with bloody vomiting, signs of hypotension (low blood pressure), tachycardia (high heart rate), pallor, and signs of liver disease (spider angiomata).

2. **Clinical Context**: His symptoms suggest a possible upper gastrointestinal bleed, likely due to esophageal varices or gastric ulcers, often seen in patients with chronic liver disease due to alcohol. His low blood pressure and high heart rate indicate a state of hypovolemia or shock.

3. **Question Focus**: The question asks what is most likely decreased in this patient compared to a healthy adult in response to his current condition.

4. **Options Analysis**:
   - (A) **Systemic vascular resistance**: In a state of shock, systemic vascular resistance usually decreases due to vasodilation.
   - (B) **Fractional tissue oxygen extraction**: This typically increases in shock as tissues extract more oxygen from the blood.
   - (C) **Carotid baroreceptor firing activity**: This would be decreased due to low blood pressure, as baroreceptors detect less stretch in the arterial walls.
   - (D) **Pulmonary vascular resistance**: This is less relevant in the context of shock and gastrointestinal bleeding.
   - (E) **Cardiac inotropy**: This may actually be increased in response to compensatory mechanisms in shock.

5. **Conclusion**: Given the patient's low blood pressure and the physiological response to hypotension, the most likely decreased parameter is (C) **Carotid baroreceptor firing activity**. This is because with low blood pressure, the stretch on the baroreceptors is reduced, leading to decreased firing activity.

Final Answer: **(C) Carotid baroreceptor firing activity**.
Path 9: Let's analyze the situation step by step.

The patient is a 52-year-old man with a significant history of alcohol use, presenting with recurrent vomiting of bloody material, hypotension (blood pressure of 85/59 mm Hg), tachycardia (pulse of 122/min), and signs of potential volume depletion (pale appearance, decreased radial pulses, delayed capillary refill). These findings suggest he may be experiencing hypovolemic shock, likely due to gastrointestinal bleeding, which can occur in patients with chronic alcohol use, possibly due to liver disease and variceal bleeding.

Now, let's consider the options given and what is likely to be decreased in this patient:

- **(A) Systemic vascular resistance**: In a state of shock, systemic vascular resistance typically increases due to compensatory mechanisms aimed at maintaining blood pressure.
  
- **(B) Fractional tissue oxygen extraction**: This may actually increase in states of shock as tissues try to extract more oxygen due to decreased perfusion.
  
- **(C) Carotid baroreceptor firing activity**: In response to low blood pressure, carotid baroreceptor firing would decrease, leading to increased sympathetic outflow to help compensate.
  
- **(D) Pulmonary vascular resistance**: This is not directly affected by the patient's condition in this context and typically remains unchanged in response to hypovolemia.
  
- **(E) Cardiac inotropy**: Inotropy refers to the strength of cardiac contraction. In a hypovolemic state, the heart may try to increase contractility due to sympathetic stimulation; however, if the heart is compromised (as might be the case with liver disease), inotropy could be decreased.

Considering all these points, the most likely answer is:

**(C) Carotid baroreceptor firing activity.**

In this patient's condition of hypotension and shock, the firing rate of carotid baroreceptors would decrease, leading to compensatory mechanisms to increase heart rate and systemic vascular resistance.
Path 10: Let's analyze the patient's condition step by step:

1. **Clinical Presentation**: The patient is a 52-year-old man with a significant history of alcohol consumption, presenting with recurrent vomiting of blood (suggesting upper gastrointestinal bleeding), signs of shock (elevated heart rate, low blood pressure), and signs of liver disease (spider angiomata, pale appearance, altered mental status).

2. **Physiological Response**: In response to hemorrhagic shock, the body typically attempts to compensate for low blood volume and inadequate perfusion. Key responses include increased heart rate, increased systemic vascular resistance (to maintain blood pressure), and increased cardiac output. 

3. **Options Analysis**:
   - (A) **Systemic vascular resistance**: This is likely increased in response to shock, not decreased.
   - (B) **Fractional tissue oxygen extraction**: This may be increased, as tissues extract more oxygen due to reduced perfusion.
   - (C) **Carotid baroreceptor firing activity**: This would be decreased due to low blood pressure, which leads to less stretch of the baroreceptors.
   - (D) **Pulmonary vascular resistance**: Typically would not be significantly affected in this context.
   - (E) **Cardiac inotropy**: Would typically be maintained or increased in shock.

4. **Conclusion**: The most likely option that is decreased in this patient, particularly in response to the low blood pressure and shock, is the carotid baroreceptor firing activity, as these receptors are less stimulated when blood pressure is low.

Therefore, the correct answer is **(C) Carotid baroreceptor firing activity**.

Question: Two months after giving birth to a boy, a 27-year-old woman comes to the physician with her infant for a well-child examination. She was not seen by a physician during her pregnancy. Physical examination of the mother and the boy shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show elevated titers of hepatitis B surface antigen in both the mother and the boy. Which of the following statements regarding the infant's condition is most accurate? (C) Lifetime risk of hepatocellular carcinoma is low (D) The viral replication rate is low (E) Significant elevation of transaminases is not expected (A) Hepatitis B e antigen titer is likely undetectable (B) Chronic infection is unlikely
Reason: The answer is (E) Significant elevation of transaminases is not expected. In infants with hepatitis B, particularly those who acquire the infection perinatally, they often maintain a relatively stable state of infection in the early stages. This is due to the immune system's immature response to the infection, which typically does not trigger severe liver inflammation or substantial transaminase elevation in the acute phase.
Answer: (E) Significant elevation of transaminases is not expected

Question: A 54-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with sudden shortness of breath. A CT scan shows multiple nodules in her left lung. She reports that for the past 6 months, she has been feeling tired and depressed. She also has frequently felt flushed, which she presumed is a symptom of getting closer to menopause. On physical examination, a nodule with a size of 2.5 cm is palpable in the left lobe of the thyroid gland; the nodule is firm and non-tender. Cervical lymphadenopathy is present. Cytology obtained by fine needle aspiration indicates a high likelihood of thyroid carcinoma. Laboratory findings show a serum basal calcitonin of 620 pg/mL. A thyroidectomy is performed but the patient presents again to the ER with flushing and diarrhea within 6 weeks. Considering this patient, which of the following treatment options should be pursued? (E) Vandetanib (C) Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) suppression (D) Tamoxifen (A) Observation (B) Radioactive iodine (radioiodine)
Reason: The answer is (E) Vandetanib. The elevated serum calcitonin level indicates the presence of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), which is a neuroendocrine tumor known to be associated with symptoms like flushing and diarrhea due to calcitonin and other peptide hormone secretion. Vandetanib is a targeted therapy that is used to treat advanced MTC, particularly in cases where surgical intervention is not completely curative or in the presence of recurrent symptoms, making it the appropriate choice for this patient's condition.

Question: A 4-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of a 1-day history of passing small quantities of dark urine. Two weeks ago, he had fever, abdominal pain, and bloody diarrhea for several days that were treated with oral antibiotics. Physical examination shows pale conjunctivae and scleral icterus. His hemoglobin concentration is 7.5 g/dL, platelet count is 95,000/mm3, and serum creatinine concentration is 1.9 mg/dL. A peripheral blood smear shows irregular red blood cell fragments. Avoiding consumption of which of the following foods would have most likely prevented this patient's condition? (A) Mushrooms (D) Undercooked beef (C) Raw pork (B) Shellfish (E) Canned carrots
Reason: The answer is (D) Undercooked beef. The presentation of dark urine, hemolytic anemia (indicated by irregular red blood cell fragments on the peripheral blood smear), and acute renal failure suggests a diagnosis of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), which is often triggered by infection with Escherichia coli O157:H7, typically associated with the consumption of undercooked beef. This bacterial infection can lead to the symptoms observed in this child, highlighting the importance of proper food handling and cooking to prevent such conditions.

Question: A 53-year-old woman visits her physician with complaints of shortness of breath and fatigue over the last few weeks. Her past medical history includes hypertension diagnosed 20 years ago. She takes hydrochlorothiazide and losartan daily. Her mother died at the age of 54 from a stroke, and both of her grandparents suffered from cardiovascular disease. She has a 13 pack-year history of smoking and drinks alcohol occasionally. Her blood pressure is 150/120 mm Hg, pulse is 95/min, respiratory rate is 22/min, and temperature is 36.7°C (98.1°F). On physical examination, she has bibasilar rales, distended jugular veins, and pitting edema in both lower extremities. Her pulse is irregularly irregular and her apical pulse is displaced laterally. Fundoscopy reveals ‘copper wiring’ and ‘cotton wool spots’. Which of the following echocardiographic findings will most likely be found in this patient? (A) Ejection fraction: 40% with increased left ventricular wall thickness (B) Ejection fraction: 60% with normal left ventricular wall thickness (D) Ejection fraction: 55% with dilated chambers and thin walls (E) Ejection fraction: 65% with rapid early diastolic filling and slow late diastolic filling (C) Ejection fraction: 80% with regurgitant aortic valve
Reason: The answer is (A) Ejection fraction: 40% with increased left ventricular wall thickness. 

This patient presents with signs and symptoms indicative of heart failure, along with risk factors like hypertension and a family history of cardiovascular disease. The bibasilar rales, distended jugular veins, and edema suggest fluid overload and possible left ventricular hypertrophy due to long-standing hypertension, which often leads to a reduced ejection fraction and increased wall thickness.
Answer: (A) Ejection fraction: 40% with increased left ventricular wall thickness

Question: A primigravid 28-year-old woman delivers a 38-week-old male infant via spontaneous vaginal delivery. She had no prenatal care during her pregnancy. At birth the infant has underdeveloped hands and radiograph reveals missing phalanges in the thumbs. Examination of the buttocks reveals a missing anus. Further work-up reveals flow between the two ventricles on echocardiography and a single kidney on preliminary abdominal ultrasound. The infant also has difficulty feeding that results in coughing and apnea. Which of the following tissues was most likely affected during embryologic development? (B) Neuroectoderm (D) Mesoderm (E) Endoderm (A) Surface ectoderm (C) Neural crest
Reason: The answer is (D) Mesoderm.

This infant presents with multiple congenital anomalies, including upper limb defects, imperforate anus, and renal agenesis, all of which are characteristic of mesodermal involvement since the mesoderm is responsible for the development of the musculoskeletal system, urinary system, and components of the cardiovascular system. The presence of these diverse defects suggests a broader defect in mesodermal development during embryogenesis.

Question: A 61-year-old man is brought to the emergency room with slurred speech. According to the patient's wife, they were watching a movie together when he developed a minor headache. He soon developed difficulty speaking in complete sentences, at which point she decided to take him to the emergency room. His past medical history is notable for hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He takes aspirin, lisinopril, rosuvastatin. The patient is a retired lawyer. He has a 25-pack-year smoking history and drinks 4-5 beers per day. His father died of a myocardial infarction, and his mother died of breast cancer. His temperature is 98.6°F (37°C), blood pressure is 143/81 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 21/min. On exam, he can understand everything that is being said to him and is able to repeat statements without difficulty. However, when asked to speak freely, he hesitates with every word and takes 30 seconds to finish a short sentence. This patient most likely has an infarct in which of the following vascular distributions? (D) Proximal middle cerebral artery (E) Superior division of the middle cerebral artery (B) Inferior division of the middle cerebral artery (C) Middle cerebral artery and posterior cerebral artery watershed area (A) Anterior cerebral artery and middle cerebral artery watershed area
Reason: The answer is (A) Anterior cerebral artery and middle cerebral artery watershed area.

The patient's symptoms, particularly the difficulty with expressive language while maintaining comprehension, suggest a form of aphasia consistent with watershed area infarcts, where blood flow from the anterior and middle cerebral arteries intersects. The hesitance and effortful speech could be indicative of the bilateral involvement that can occur in watershed infarcts, leading to dysphasia due to ischemia in the areas responsible for speech production.
Answer: (A) Anterior cerebral artery and middle cerebral artery watershed area

She decides which patient will be in which group by using a random number generator. Subsequently, she prepares 1 set of syringes with the novel substance X and 1 set of syringes with a saline control. Both of these sets of syringes are unlabeled and the substances inside cannot be distinguished. She gives the surgeon performing the surgery 1 of the syringes and does not inform him nor the patient which syringe was used. After the study is complete, she analyzes all the data that was collected and performs statistical analysis. This study most likely provides which level of evidence for use of substance X? (E) Level 5 (C) Level 3 (A) Level 1 (D) Level 4 (B) Level 2
Reason: This study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) where participants are randomly assigned to either the treatment group (substance X) or control group (saline), and both the patients and the surgeon are blinded to the treatment assignment. RCTs are considered the gold standard in clinical research for determining efficacy and safety, thus providing the highest level of evidence (Level 1) when evaluating new treatments.
Answer: (A) Level 1

Question: A six-year-old male presents to the pediatrician for a well child visit. The patient’s parents report that they are struggling to manage his temper tantrums, which happen as frequently as several times per day. They usually occur in the morning before school and during mealtimes, when his parents try to limit how much he eats. The patient often returns for second or third helpings at meals and snacks throughout the day. The patient’s parents have begun limiting the patient’s food intake because he has been gaining weight. They also report that the patient recently began first grade but still struggles with counting objects and naming letters consistently. The patient sat without support at 11 months of age and walked at 17 months of age. He is in the 99th percentile for weight and 5th percentile for height. On physical exam, he has almond-shaped eyes and a downturned mouth. He has poor muscle tone.

Which of the following additional findings would most likely be seen in this patient? (E) Webbed neck (D) Macroorchidism (A) Ataxia (B) Hemihyperplasia (C) Hypogonadism
Reason: The patient's presentation, including obesity, developmental delays, facial features (almond-shaped eyes and downturned mouth), and hypotonia, is suggestive of a genetic disorder, specifically Prader-Willi syndrome. Individuals with Prader-Willi syndrome often exhibit hypogonadism, which is characterized by underdeveloped gonads and reduced sex hormone levels, in addition to obesity and hyperphagia (overeating).
Answer: (C) Hypogonadism

Question: A 71-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 4-month history of worsening cough and a 4.5-kg (10-lb) weight loss. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 35 years. Physical examination shows wheezing over the right lung fields. Laboratory studies show a serum calcium concentration of 12.5 mg/dL. X-rays of the chest are shown. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? (D) Sarcoidosis (A) Lobar pneumonia (C) Tuberculosis (B) Small cell lung carcinoma (E) Squamous cell lung carcinoma
Reason: The most likely diagnosis is squamous cell lung carcinoma because the patient has a significant history of smoking, which is a major risk factor for lung cancer. Additionally, the elevated serum calcium level (hypercalcemia) can be associated with squamous cell lung carcinoma due to paraneoplastic syndromes, where the tumor produces substances that mimic hormones or other signaling molecules, leading to elevated calcium levels.
Answer: (E) Squamous cell lung carcinoma

Question: A 10-year-old boy who recently immigrated to the United States from Africa with his family is brought to the emergency department by his mother for a progressively worsening ulcerative lesion on his jaw. His mother reports that her son’s right jaw has rapidly enlarged over the past few months. He says that it is very tender though he doesn’t recall any trauma to the site. In addition, the mother says her son hasn’t been himself the past few months with intermittent fever, weakness, and fatigue. Physical exam reveals a large, ulcerating right jaw mass that is draining serous fluid and painless cervical and axillary lymphadenopathy. Laboratory results are notable for an elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase. A biopsy of the right jaw mass is shown in the photograph. Which of the following chromosomal translocations is most likely to be found in this patient’s lesion? (C) t(11;14) (A) t(8;14) (B) t(9;22) (D) t(14;18) (E) t(15;17)
Reason: The most likely chromosomal translocation in this case is t(8;14), which is associated with Burkitt lymphoma, a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that can present with jaw lesions, especially in children from endemic regions, such as parts of Africa. The symptoms of the rapidly enlarging ulcerative lesion, significant lymphadenopathy, and systemic signs like fever and fatigue are indicative of an aggressive lymphoma, which correlates with the presence of the t(8;14) translocation involving the MYC oncogene.
Answer: (A) t(8;14)

Question: A 58-year-old woman presents to the physician for a routine gynecological visit. She denies any acute issues and remarks that she has not been sexually active for the past year. Her last Pap test was negative for any abnormal cytology. A pelvic examination and Pap test is performed at the current visit with no remarkable findings. Which of the following approaches to cervical cancer screening is most appropriate for this patient? (B) Colposcopy in 3 years (A) Colposcopy at the current visit to verify Pap test results (D) Pap test and HPV test in 5 years (C) Discontinue screening until the patient becomes sexually active (E) Pap test only in 5 years
Reason: The most appropriate approach to cervical cancer screening for this patient is to perform a Pap test and HPV test in 5 years because she is 58 years old and has had negative results on her previous Pap tests, indicating low risk for cervical cancer. As per guidelines, women aged 30 to 65 can safely choose to have co-testing (Pap and HPV) every 5 years or Pap alone every 3 years, and given her lack of concerning symptoms and prior negative screenings, the longer interval of 5 years is suitable.
Answer: (D) Pap test and HPV test in 5 years

Question: A 15-year-old girl is hospitalized because of increased fatigue and weight loss over the past 2 months. The patient has no personal or family history of a serious illness. She takes no medications, currently. Her blood pressure is 175/74 mm Hg on the left arm and 90/45 on the right. The radial pulse is 84/min but weaker on the right side. The femoral blood pressure and pulses show no abnormalities. Temperature is 38.1℃ (100.6℉). The muscles over the right upper arm are slightly atrophic. The remainder of the examination reveals no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show the following results:
Hemoglobin 10.4 g/dL
Leukocyte count 5,000/mm3
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate 58 mm/h
Magnetic resonance arteriography reveals irregularity, stenosis, and poststenotic dilation involving the proximal right subclavian artery. Prednisone is initiated with improvement of her symptoms. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the patient management? (B) Cyclophosphamide (A) Carvedilol + hydrochlorothiazide (C) Plasmapheresis (E) Surgery (D) Rituximab
Reason: The answer provided seems incorrect based on the clinical context. The clinical scenario suggests a diagnosis of large vessel vasculitis, likely Takayasu arteritis, given the patient's age, symptoms of fatigue, weight loss, hypertension discrepancy between limbs, and imaging findings. The management of this condition after initiating prednisone typically would involve additional immunosuppressive therapy. 

Given that cyclophosphamide is an effective immunosuppressant for managing severe vasculitis, it would be more appropriate than the antihypertensive regimen of carvedilol and hydrochlorothiazide for this patient. Thus, the next step in management should involve starting cyclophosphamide, making it critical to address the underlying inflammatory process instead of just managing blood pressure.
Answer: (A) Carvedilol + hydrochlorothiazide

Question: A 22-year-old man comes to the physician because of a progressive swelling and pain in his right ring finger for the past 2 days. The pain began while playing football, when his finger got caught in the jersey of another player who forcefully pulled away. Examination shows that the right ring finger is extended. There is pain and swelling at the distal interphalangeal joint. When the patient is asked to make a fist, his right ring finger does not flex at the distal interphalangeal joint. There is no joint laxity. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? (B) Closed fracture of the distal phalanx (C) Rupture of the extensor digitorum tendon at its point of insertion (D) Inflammation of the flexor digitorum profundus tendon sheath (E) Slipping of the central band of the extensor digitorum tendon (A) Rupture of the flexor digitorum profundus tendon at its point of insertion
Reason: The answer provided is inaccurate based on the clinical description given. The symptoms of pain, swelling, and inability to flex the distal phalanx while the finger is extended suggest a problem with the extensor mechanism rather than the flexor. 

The scenario describes a likely rupture of the extensor digitorum tendon at its insertion, which would lead to an inability to flex the distal interphalangeal joint (due to the dominant role of the extensor in allowing for extension while flexion is intact). Therefore, the most accurate diagnosis given the circumstances is likely a rupture of the extensor digitorum tendon, not the flexor.
Answer: (A) Rupture of the flexor digitorum profundus tendon at its point of insertion

Question: A study seeks to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of treating asymptomatic subclinical hypothyroidism in preventing symptoms of hypothyroidism. The investigators found 300 asymptomatic patients with subclinical hypothyroidism, defined as serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) of 5 to 10 μU/mL with normal serum thyroxine (T4) levels. The patients were randomized to either thyroxine 75 μg daily or placebo. Both investigators and study subjects were blinded. Baseline patient characteristics were distributed similarly in the treatment and control group (p > 0.05). Participants' serum T4 and TSH levels and subjective quality of life were evaluated at a 3-week follow-up. No difference was found between the treatment and placebo groups. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for the results of this study? (E) Observer effect (D) Berkson bias (A) Lead-time bias (B) Latency period (C) Confounding bias
Reason: The answer "B) Latency period" seems to be incorrect given the study's design and results. The finding of no difference between the treatment and placebo groups, despite the use of an appropriate control and blind design, suggests that treating asymptomatic subclinical hypothyroidism with thyroxine may not be effective in the short follow-up period.

In this context, the most likely explanation for these results is tied to the idea that the treatment may require a longer duration before any potential benefits are observed, which aligns more closely with the concept of a latency period. However, latency typically refers to the time until symptoms manifest in disease and might not be the most relevant explanation for the immediate ineffectiveness observed here. Thus, a more appropriate explanation might involve questioning whether any treatment effect exists, rather than attributing the results directly to a latency period.
Answer: (B) Latency period

Lipase 1,262 U/L
        (C) Acute pancreatitis (A) Acute liver failure (D) Acute mesenteric ischemia (B) Acute cholecystitis (E) Gastric ulcer
Reason: The most likely diagnosis is acute pancreatitis, supported by the elevated levels of amylase and lipase in the laboratory results. These enzymes are typically significantly increased in cases of pancreatitis, and the patient's abdominal pain after meals aligns with this condition, possibly exacerbated by her alcohol consumption.

Question: Three hours after undergoing left hip arthroplasty for chronic hip pain, a 62-year-old man complains of a prickling sensation in his left anteromedial thigh and lower leg. He has never had these symptoms before. He has hyperlipidemia and coronary artery disease. He has had recent right-sided gluteal and thigh pain with ambulation. Vital signs are within normal limits. Sensation to pinprick and light touch are decreased on the anteromedial left thigh as well as medial lower leg. Neurologic exam shows left leg strength 3/5 on hip flexion and 2/5 on knee extension. Patellar reflex is decreased on the left. The remainder of neurologic exam is normal. Dorsalis pedis, popliteal, and femoral pulses are 2+ bilaterally. The surgical incision is without erythema or drainage. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms? (C) Surgical site infection (D) Sural nerve injury (E) Femoral artery occlusion
" (A) Obturator nerve injury (B) Femoral nerve injury
Reason: The most likely underlying cause of the patient's symptoms is femoral nerve injury, as evidenced by the specific motor and sensory deficits observed in the left anteromedial thigh and knee. The weakness in hip flexion and knee extension, along with decreased sensation in the distribution of the femoral nerve, point towards an injury to this nerve, which can occur during hip arthroplasty procedures.

Question: A 61-year-old man presents with gradually increasing shortness of breath. For the last 2 years, he has had a productive cough on most days. Past medical history is significant for hypertension and a recent admission to the hospital for pneumonia. He uses a triamcinolone inhaler and uses an albuterol inhaler as a rescue inhaler. He also takes lisinopril and a multivitamin daily. He has smoked a pack a day for the last 32 years and has no intention to quit now. Today, his blood pressure is 142/97 mm Hg, heart rate is 97/min, respiratory rate is 22/min, and temperature is 37.4°C (99.3°F). On physical exam, he has tachypnea and has some difficulty finishing his sentences. His heart has a regular rate and rhythm. Auscultation of his lungs reveals wheezing and rhonchi that improves after a deep cough. Fremitus is absent. Pulmonary function tests show FEV1/FVC of 55% with no change in FEV1 after albuterol treatment. Which of the following is the most likely pathology associated with this patients disease? (D) Inflamed bronchus with hypertrophy and hyperplasia of mucous glands (E) Consolidation and red hepatization (B) Chronic granulomatous inflammation with bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy (C) Airway hypersensitivity (A) Permanent bronchial dilation
Reason: The correct answer is (D) Inflamed bronchus with hypertrophy and hyperplasia of mucous glands. The patient's symptoms and history, including chronic cough, productive sputum, and a smoking history, are indicative of chronic bronchitis, which is characterized by inflammation of the bronchial tubes and mucus gland hyperplasia. This condition leads to increased mucus production and airway obstruction, consistent with the findings of wheezing and poor response to albuterol inhaler usage in pulmonary function testing.

[INFO] Opinion paths:
Path 1: Let's analyze the information step by step. 

The key findings in this 14-year-old boy are:
- Mild normocytic anemia with reticulocytosis
- Indirect hyperbilirubinemia
- Negative Coombs test
- Increased osmotic fragility test indicating increased fragility of red blood cells in hypotonic solutions.

Given these findings, the most likely diagnosis is hereditary spherocytosis, a condition characterized by a defect in the red blood cell membrane that leads to the formation of spherocytes.

Now let's evaluate the options:

(A) Hypersegmented neutrophils - Typically associated with megaloblastic anemia, not applicable here.

(B) Schistocytes - These are fragmented red blood cells usually seen in microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, not the case here.

(C) Sideroblasts - These are seen in certain types of anemia but are not characteristic of hereditary spherocytosis.

(D) Spherocytes - These are small, round red blood cells that are characteristic of hereditary spherocytosis and would be expected on a blood smear.

(E) Dacrocytes - These are teardrop-shaped red blood cells often seen in myelofibrosis or certain anemias, not characteristic of hereditary spherocytosis.

Considering all of this, the most likely findings on a blood smear for this patient would be:

**Answer: (D) Spherocytes.**

- Increased osmotic fragility in a hypotonic solution

The combination of indirect hyperbilirubinemia, reticulocytosis, and increased osmotic fragility suggests a hemolytic anemia. In cases of hemolytic anemia, particularly hereditary spherocytosis (which is characterized by increased osmotic fragility), we would expect to see spherocytes on a blood smear.

Spherocytes are red blood cells that are smaller and rounder than normal, lacking the typical biconcave shape, and they are typically found in conditions associated with hemolysis due to membrane defects.

Given all this information, the most likely findings on a blood smear for this patient would be:

**Answer: (D) Spherocytes**
Path 3: Let's analyze the information step by step:

- The patient is a 14-year-old boy with right upper quadrant abdominal pain and ultrasound findings of a gallstone.
- The laboratory tests show mild normocytic anemia with reticulocytosis, increased RDW, indirect hyperbilirubinemia, and a negative Coombs test.
- The osmotic fragility test shows increased fragility in hypotonic solution.

Given these findings, the combination of indirect hyperbilirubinemia, reticulocytosis, and increased osmotic fragility suggests a diagnosis of hereditary spherocytosis, a condition characterized by the presence of spherocytes in the blood.

Spherocytes are red blood cells that are sphere-shaped rather than the typical biconcave disk shape. They are less stable in hypotonic solutions, leading to increased fragility, which aligns with the osmotic fragility test results.

**Answer: (D) Spherocytes**
Path 4: Let's analyze the case step by step. 

The patient is a 14-year-old boy with right upper quadrant abdominal pain and gallstones. The laboratory findings indicate:

1. Mild normocytic anemia with reticulocytosis.
2. Increased RDW (red cell distribution width).
3. Indirect hyperbilirubinemia.
4. Negative Coombs test.
5. Increased fragility in an osmotic fragility test.

These findings suggest a hemolytic anemia. The negative Coombs test indicates that the hemolysis is not due to autoimmune causes. The increased osmotic fragility suggests that the red blood cells are more susceptible to hemolysis in hypotonic solutions, which is indicative of hereditary spherocytosis.

In hereditary spherocytosis, the red blood cells (RBCs) are spherical instead of the typical biconcave disc shape, leading to increased fragility and hemolysis. Therefore, on a blood smear, we would expect to see spherocytes.

Now, let's look at the options provided:

(C) Sideroblasts - These are associated with certain types of anemia, particularly sideroblastic anemia, not related to this case.
(A) Hypersegmented neutrophils - This finding is typically associated with megaloblastic anemia.
(D) Spherocytes - These are characteristic of hereditary spherocytosis.
(B) Schistocytes - These are fragmented RBCs seen in microangiopathic hemolytic anemias.
(E) Dacrocytes - These are teardrop cells seen in myelofibrosis and other conditions.

Based on the clinical picture and the findings from the osmotic fragility test, the most likely anticipated finding on a blood smear in this patient would be:

**Answer: (D) Spherocytes**
Path 5: Let's analyze the information given step by step.

The patient in the scenario is a 14-year-old boy with the following findings:
- Right upper quadrant abdominal pain and gallstone identified via ultrasound.
- Mild normocytic anemia with reticulocytosis.
- Increased RDW (Red Cell Distribution Width).
- Indirect hyperbilirubinemia.
- Negative Coombs test.
- Increased fragility in the osmotic fragility test.

The key findings here point towards a diagnosis of hereditary spherocytosis, a condition that causes the formation of spherocytes (abnormally shaped red blood cells) due to a defect in the red blood cell membrane proteins. The increased osmotic fragility indicates that the red blood cells are more prone to lysis in hypotonic solutions, which is characteristic of spherocytes.

Now let's evaluate the options based on this diagnosis:
- **(C) Sideroblasts**: These are seen in sideroblastic anemia, which is not indicated here.
- **(A) Hypersegmented neutrophils**: These are typically seen in megaloblastic anemia, not relevant in this case.
- **(D) Spherocytes**: This is the expected finding in hereditary spherocytosis, aligning with the diagnosis.
- **(B) Schistocytes**: These are fragmented red blood cells seen in conditions like microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and are not characteristic of hereditary spherocytosis.
- **(E) Dacrocytes**: These are tear-drop shaped red blood cells often seen in myelofibrosis or certain hemolytic anemias but not in this context.

Considering all these points, the most likely finding on a blood smear for this patient would be:

**Answer: (D) Spherocytes**
Path 6: Let's analyze the information step by step:

1. The 14-year-old boy has right upper quadrant abdominal pain and an ultrasound shows a gallstone.
2. Laboratory tests show mild normocytic anemia with reticulocytosis, increased RDW, indirect hyperbilirubinemia, and a negative Coombs test.
3. An osmotic fragility test showing increased fragility in hypotonic solution suggests a problem with the red blood cell membrane.

The combination of these findings, particularly the increased osmotic fragility, is characteristic of hereditary spherocytosis, a condition where the red blood cells are more spherical than normal and are prone to hemolysis.

In hereditary spherocytosis, if a blood smear were obtained, one would expect to see:

- **Spherocytes**: These are small, round red blood cells that are less flexible and do not deform well, leading to their increased destruction in the spleen and contributing to the hemolytic anemia.

Given this information, the most likely findings on a blood smear would be:

**Answer: (D) Spherocytes**
Path 7: Let's analyze the information step by step.

1. **Clinical Presentation**: The patient is a 14-year-old boy with right upper quadrant pain and is found to have a gallstone.
2. **Laboratory Findings**: The CBC shows mild normocytic anemia with reticulocytosis, increased RDW, indirect hyperbilirubinemia, and a negative Coombs test. 
3. **Osmotic Fragility Test**: The test shows increased fragility in hypotonic solutions, which is characteristic of certain types of hemolytic anemia.

The findings suggest that this patient likely has hereditary spherocytosis, which is characterized by the presence of spherocytes (abnormally shaped red blood cells) due to membrane defects. 

- **Spherocytes**: These are typically smaller and rounder than normal red blood cells and are less able to withstand osmotic stress, leading to hemolysis, which explains the anemia and reticulocytosis.

Given these points, the most anticipated finding on a blood smear for this patient would be:

**Answer: (D) Spherocytes**
Path 8: Let's think through the clinical scenario step by step.

The patient is a 14-year-old boy with right upper quadrant abdominal pain and gallstones. The laboratory findings include mild normocytic anemia with reticulocytosis, increased RDW, indirect hyperbilirubinemia, and a negative Coombs test. These findings suggest a hemolytic process that is likely due to a hereditary condition.

The osmotic fragility test shows increased fragility in hypotonic solution, which is characteristic of hereditary spherocytosis. In this condition, the red blood cells are more spherical in shape rather than the usual biconcave disc shape, making them more susceptible to lysis in hypotonic solutions.

Given this information, if a blood smear were obtained from this patient, the most likely finding would be:

(D) Spherocytes.

Therefore, the answer is (D) Spherocytes.
Path 9: Let's analyze the information step by step.

The clinical scenario describes a 14-year-old boy with gallstones associated with mild normocytic anemia, reticulocytosis, indirect hyperbilirubinemia, and a negative Coombs test. The osmotic fragility test shows increased fragility in a hypotonic solution, which is indicative of hereditary spherocytosis.

In hereditary spherocytosis, the red blood cells lose membrane surface area and become spherical rather than the normal biconcave disk shape. This leads to increased osmotic fragility and can cause hemolytic anemia.

Given this context, if a blood smear were obtained, the most likely finding would be:

(D) Spherocytes

Spherocytes are the characteristic cells found in hereditary spherocytosis due to the loss of membrane surface area. 

Thus, the answer is: **(D) Spherocytes.**
Path 10: Let's analyze the information step by step.

The patient is a 14-year-old boy with right upper quadrant abdominal pain and gallstones. The lab findings indicate:
- Mild normocytic anemia with reticulocytosis
- Increased RDW (red cell distribution width)
- Indirect hyperbilirubinemia
- Negative Coombs test
- Increased fragility in the osmotic fragility test

The presence of reticulocytosis along with the findings of indirect hyperbilirubinemia and increased fragility in hypotonic solution suggests a hemolytic anemia. The negative Coombs test indicates that this is likely not an autoimmune hemolytic anemia.

The osmotic fragility test showing increased fragility is indicative of hereditary spherocytosis, a condition characterized by the presence of spherocytes in the blood due to a defect in the red blood cell membrane proteins.

In hereditary spherocytosis, a blood smear would typically show **spherocytes**, which are red blood cells that are smaller and rounder than normal red blood cells, lacking the typical biconcave shape.

Therefore, the findings that would most likely be anticipated if a blood smear were obtained in this patient would be:

**Answer: (D) Spherocytes**

Question: A 7-year-old boy is brought to the physician for recurrent 3–4 minutes episodes of facial grimacing and staring over the past month. He is nonresponsive during these episodes and does not remember them afterward. He recalls a muddy taste in his mouth before the onset of symptoms. One week ago, his brother witnessed an episode where he woke up, stared, and made hand gestures. After the incident, he felt lethargic and confused. Examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? (C) Simple partial seizures (D) Breath-holding spell (B) Myoclonic seizure (A) Absence seizures (E) Complex partial seizure
Reason: The symptoms described in the question suggest a loss of consciousness and altered awareness during episodes, which aligns with the characteristics of complex partial seizures. The presence of auras (muddy taste) and postictal confusion (lethargy and confusion after the episode) further indicate that this is not a simple partial seizure or an absence seizure, making complex partial seizure the most likely diagnosis.
Answer: (E) Complex partial seizure

Question: A 7-month-old girl is brought to the hospital by her mother, who complains of a lesion on the infant’s labia for the past 5 days. The lesion is 2 x 2 cm in size and red in color with serosanguinous fluid oozing out of the right labia. The parents note that the girl has had a history of recurrent bacterial skin infections with no pus but delayed healing since birth. She also had delayed sloughing of the umbilical cord at birth. Complete blood count results are as follows:
Neutrophils on admission  
Leukocytes 19,000/mm3
Neutrophils 83%
Lymphocytes 10%
Eosinophils 1%
Basophils 1%
Monocytes 5%
Hemoglobin 14 g/dL
Which of the following compounds is most likely to be deficient in this patient? (A) Cellular adhesion molecule (D) Integrin subunit (E) TNF-alpha (B) Selectin (C) vWF
Reason: The clinical presentation of recurrent bacterial skin infections and delayed healing, along with the elevated leukocyte count and the predominance of neutrophils, suggests a likely defect in leukocyte adhesion and function. Integrin subunits are crucial for the adhesion of leukocytes to the endothelium and their subsequent migration to sites of infection, which can explain the recurrent infections and delayed wound healing seen in this patient.
Answer: (D) Integrin subunit

Question: A 15-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his parents because of lethargy, repeated vomiting, and abdominal pain for 6 hours. Over the past 2 weeks, he has reported increased urinary frequency to his parents that they attributed to his increased oral fluid intake. Examination shows dry mucous membranes and rapid, deep breathing. Laboratory studies show the presence of acetoacetate in the urine. Which of the following cells is unable to use this molecule for energy production? (E) Myocyte
" (D) Hepatocyte (C) Neuron (B) Thrombocyte (A) Adipocyte
Reason: The answer is (D) Hepatocyte. Hepatocytes are the liver cells responsible for various metabolic processes, including gluconeogenesis and ketogenesis, but they are unable to utilize ketones, such as acetoacetate, for energy production directly. Instead, they primarily produce ketones from fatty acids and release them into the bloodstream for use by other tissues, such as muscle and brain cells, which can utilize acetoacetate as an energy source.
Answer: (D) Hepatocyte

Question: A 33-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 3-week history of fatigue and worsening shortness of breath on exertion. There is no family history of serious illness. She does not smoke. She takes diethylpropion to control her appetite and, as a result, has had a 4.5-kg (10-lb) weight loss during the past 5 months. She is 163 cm (5 ft 4 in) tall and weighs 115 kg (254 lb); BMI is 44 kg/m2. Her pulse is 83/min and blood pressure is 125/85 mm Hg. Cardiac examination shows a loud pulmonary component of the S2. Abdominal examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's shortness of breath? (D) Fibrosis of pulmonary interstitium (B) Hyperplasia of pulmonary vascular walls (A) Hypertrophy of interventricular septum (C) Blockade of the right bundle branch (E) Calcification of the pulmonary valve
Reason: The answer is (B) Hyperplasia of pulmonary vascular walls. This patient presents with significant obesity, which can lead to obesity hypoventilation syndrome and pulmonary hypertension due to increased blood flow and pressure in the pulmonary circulation. As a result, hyperplasia of the pulmonary vascular walls occurs in response to the elevated pressure, contributing to her worsening shortness of breath on exertion.
Answer: (B) Hyperplasia of pulmonary vascular walls

Initially, she refused treatment, but an hour ago she began to develop a severe headache, nausea, and right leg weakness. She has osteopenia. Her only medication is a daily multivitamin. She has no visual changes and is oriented to person, time, and place. Her temperature is 37.2°C (99°F), pulse is 72/min, respirations are 18/min and regular, and blood pressure is 128/75 mm Hg. Examination shows a 5-cm bruise on the left side of her skull. The pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation. Muscle strength is 0/5 in her right knee and foot. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms? (C) Uncal herniation (B) Upward brainstem herniation (D) Subfalcine herniation (E) Extracranial herniation (A) Tonsillar herniation
Reason: The answer is (D) Subfalcine herniation. This patient has developed neurological symptoms, including right leg weakness, after a head injury, which suggests increased intracranial pressure and potential herniation. Subfalcine herniation occurs when brain tissue is displaced under the falx cerebri, often leading to compression of the contralateral motor pathways, which can explain her unilateral weakness.
Answer: (D) Subfalcine herniation

Question: A 32-year-old HIV positive female known to be non-adherent to her treatment regimen, presents to the hospital with the complaint of new-onset headaches. Her vital signs are only significant for a low-grade fever. Neurological examination reveals right-sided upper motor neuron signs, as well as a inattention and difficulty with concentration. The patient currently does not have a primary medical provider. A CT of the patients head is shown in the image below. What is the next best step in management for this patient? (D) Begin treatment with albendazole and corticosteroids (C) Begin treatment with pyrimethamine-sulfadiazine (A) Perform a biopsy of the lesion (E) Begin treatment with acyclovir (B) Perform an analysis for 14-3-3 protein levels
Reason: The answer is (C) Begin treatment with pyrimethamine-sulfadiazine because the patient's symptoms and history suggest a possible diagnosis of cerebral toxoplasmosis, which is a common complication in HIV/AIDS patients with low CD4 counts. The presence of neurological signs and her non-adherence to antiretroviral therapy increases the likelihood of this opportunistic infection, making specific treatment necessary.
Answer: (C) Begin treatment with pyrimethamine-sulfadiazine

Question: A 14-year-old boy who has been otherwise healthy presents to his doctor complaining of feeling easily winded and light-headed at basketball practice. He has never felt this way before and is frustrated because he is good enough to make varsity this year. He denies smoking, alcohol, or recreational drug use. His mother is very worried because her oldest son and brother had both died suddenly while playing sports despite being otherwise healthy. The transthoracic echocardiogram confirms the suspected diagnosis, which demonstrates a preserved ejection fraction and systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve. The patient is advised that he will need to stay hydrated and avoid intense exercise, and he will likely need an ICD due to his family history. Which of the following physical exam findings is consistent with this patient’s most likely diagnosis? (B) Systolic ejection murmur that radiates to the carotids (A) S3 heart sound (E) Systolic ejection murmur that improves with the Valsalva maneuver (D) Mitral regurgitation (C) Tricuspid regurgitation
Reason: The answer is (D) Mitral regurgitation because the patient's presentation is consistent with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), a condition that can cause outflow obstruction and mitral valve dysfunction, leading to mitral regurgitation. In patients with HCM, it is common to find mitral regurgitation on examination due to the displacement of the mitral valve apparatus often associated with systolic anterior motion.
Answer: (D) Mitral regurgitation

Question: A 4-year-old girl presents with recurrent abdominal pain and a low-grade fever for the past 2 months. The patient’s mother says that she has lost her appetite which has caused some recent weight loss. She adds that the patient frequently plays outdoors with their pet dog. The patient is afebrile and vital signs are within normal limits. On physical examination, conjunctival pallor is present. Abdominal examination reveals a diffusely tender abdomen and significant hepatomegaly. There is also a solid mass palpable in the right upper quadrant measuring about 3 x 4 cm. Laboratory findings are significant for the following:
Hemoglobin (Hb%) 9.9 g/dL
Total count (WBC) 26,300/µL
Differential count  
Neutrophils 36%
Lymphocytes 16%
Eosinophils 46%
Platelets 200,000/mm3
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate  56 mm/h
C-reactive protein 2 mg/L
Serum globulins 5 g/dL
Laparoscopic resection of the mass is performed, and a tissue sample is sent for histopathology. Which of the following is the organism most likely responsible for this patient’s condition? (B) Ancylostoma braziliense (E) Toxocara cati (C) Ascaris lumbricoides (D) Trichuris trichiura (A) Toxocara canis
Reason: The answer is (A) Toxocara canis because the patient's history of playing outdoors with a pet dog, along with the symptoms of abdominal pain, hepatomegaly, eosinophilia, and leukocytosis, suggest a possible diagnosis of visceral larva migrans, which is caused by the ingestion of Toxocara canis eggs. The presence of a solid mass in the abdomen, along with significant eosinophilia, aligns with this diagnosis, as Toxocara canis is known to cause such systemic manifestations in children.

An echocardiogram reveals left ventricular wall motion abnormalities. With the pain subsiding, she was admitted and the medications were continued. A coronary angiography is planned in 4 days. In addition to regular blood glucose testing, which of the following should be closely monitored in this patient? (B) Prothrombin time alone (E) Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) alone (A) Prothrombin time and platelet count (C) aPTT and platelet count (D) Platelet count alone
Reason: In this patient undergoing treatment with unfractionated heparin, it's important to monitor both the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and the platelet count, as heparin can affect coagulation and may also lead to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Monitoring the aPTT ensures that the heparin's anticoagulation effect is within the desired range, while monitoring the platelet count helps to detect any potential drop in platelets that could indicate HIT, a serious complication associated with heparin therapy.
Answer: (C) aPTT and platelet count

Question: A 31-year-old G1P0 woman at 26 weeks gestation presents to the clinic for evaluation of an abnormal glucose tolerance test. She denies any symptoms, but states that she was given 50 g of oral glucose 1 week earlier and demonstrated a subsequent venous plasma glucose level of 156 mg/dL 1 hour later. The vital signs are: blood pressure, 112/78 mm Hg; pulse, 81/min; and respiratory rate, 16/min. Physical examination is within normal limits. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? (B) Administer an oral, 3-hour 100 g glucose dose (E) Order a fetal ultrasound examination (D) Begin insulin treatment (A) Repeat the 50 g oral glucose challenge (C) Advise the patient to follow an American Diabetic Association diet plan
Reason: The next appropriate step in management for this patient is to administer a 3-hour, 100 g oral glucose tolerance test because the initial 50 g test indicated impaired glucose tolerance, defined by a result (156 mg/dL) higher than the typically acceptable threshold (140 mg/dL). This subsequent test will help confirm the diagnosis of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) by allowing for more comprehensive assessment of her glucose metabolism over multiple time points, which is essential in managing potential risks to both the mother and the fetus.

Question: A 33-year-old woman comes to the emergency department for the evaluation of a headache and increased sweating for the last two hours. The patient also reports palpitations and nausea. Yesterday, she was started on venlafaxine for treatment-resistant depression. She took citalopram for four weeks, but stopped three days ago because her symptoms of depression did not improve. She does not smoke or drink alcohol. Her temperature is 39°C (102.2°F), pulse is 120/min, and blood pressure is 150/90 mm Hg. On mental status examination, the patient is only oriented to person, but not to place or time. Examination shows tremors in all extremities. She has impaired gait. Deep tendon reflexes are 3+ bilaterally. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms? (E) Suspected amphetamine intake (A) Abnormal ryanodine receptor (B) Increased CNS serotonergic activity (D) Anticholinergic toxicity (C) Dopamine receptor blockade
Reason: The patient's symptoms, which include a headache, increased sweating, palpitations, and nausea, along with significant changes in her mental status and motor function, are indicative of serotonin syndrome. This condition can occur after the initiation of serotonergic medications like venlafaxine, especially given her recent transition from citalopram, another serotonergic agent, resulting in increased CNS serotonergic activity.

Question: An investigator is studying the crossbridge cycle of muscle contraction. Tissue from the biceps brachii muscle is obtained at the autopsy of an 87-year-old man. Investigation of the muscle tissue shows myosin heads attached to actin filaments. Binding of myosin heads to which of the following elements would most likely cause detachment of myosin from actin filaments? (D) Tropomyosin (C) ATP (E) ADP (A) cGMP (B) Troponin C
Reason: The detachment of myosin heads from actin filaments during the crossbridge cycle is dependent on the binding of ATP to the myosin heads. When ATP binds, it causes a conformational change that reduces the affinity of myosin for actin, leading to the release of the myosin heads and allowing muscle relaxation.
Answer: (C) ATP

Question: A 59-year-old man presents to the emergency department with right-sided weakness and an inability to speak for the past 2 hours. His wife says he was gardening in his backyard when he suddenly lost balance and fell down. The patient has a past medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease. Two years ago, he was admitted to the coronary intensive care unit with an anterolateral myocardial infarction. He has not been compliant with his medications since he was discharged. On physical examination, his blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg, pulse is 110/min and irregular, temperature is 36.6°C (97.8°F), and respiratory rate is 18/min. Strength is 2/5 in both his right upper and right lower extremities. His right calf is edematous with visible varicose veins. Which of the following is the best method to detect the source of this patient’s stroke? (C) Head CT without contrast (A) Duplex ultrasound of his right leg (E) V/Q scan of his lungs (B) Carotid duplex (D) ECG
Reason: The best method to detect the source of this patient’s stroke is an ECG because the patient's presentation, including his irregular pulse, raises suspicion for an atrial fibrillation, which is a common cause of embolic strokes. An ECG would help identify any arrhythmias that could contribute to thromboembolic events, ultimately guiding appropriate management strategies for his stroke.

Question: A 53-year-old man is brought to the emergency department for confusion. He was in his usual state of health until about 3 hours ago when he tried to use his sandwich to turn off the TV. He also complained to his wife that he had a severe headache. Past medical history is notable for hypertension, which has been difficult to control on multiple medications. His temperature is 36.7°C (98°F), the pulse is 70/min, and the blood pressure is 206/132 mm Hg. On physical exam he is alert and oriented only to himself, repeating over and over that his head hurts. The physical exam is otherwise unremarkable and his neurologic exam is nonfocal. The noncontrast CT scan of the patient’s head is shown. Which of the following diagnostic tests is likely to reveal the diagnosis for this patient? (B) CT angiography of the neck (A) CT angiography of the brain (C) Electroencephalogram (EEG) (D) Lumbar puncture (E) MRI of the brain
Reason: The correct answer is likely (E) MRI of the brain because the patient's symptoms suggest a potential intracranial process, such as a stroke or other structural abnormality, which may not be fully resolved on a non-contrast CT scan. An MRI provides more detailed imaging of the brain's structures and is better suited to detect certain conditions that could explain the patient's confusion and headache, especially given the history of difficult-to-control hypertension, which can lead to various cerebrovascular incidents.
Answer: (E) MRI of the brain

Question: A 2-year-old boy is brought to the office by his mother due to the recent onset of fever and ear pain. He began tugging on his ear and complaining of pain 3 days ago. The mother reports a temperature of 37.8°C (100.0°F) this morning, with decreased appetite. The current temperature is 38.6ºC (101.4ºF). Ear, nose, and throat (ENT) examination shows erythema and decreased the mobility of the right tympanic membrane. Which is the most appropriate pharmacological agent for the management of this patient? (D) Ciprofloxacin (A) Amoxicillin (C) Ceftriaxone (B) Azithromycin (E) Piperacillin
Reason: The correct answer is (A) Amoxicillin because the clinical presentation is consistent with acute otitis media, which is commonly caused by bacterial infections in children. Amoxicillin is the first-line antibiotic treatment for this condition, particularly given the patient's symptoms of fever, ear tugging, and findings of tympanic membrane erythema and decreased mobility.
Answer: (A) Amoxicillin

Question: A 57-year-old florist presents to his family physician with nodular lesions on his right hand and forearm. He explains that he got pricked by a rose thorn on his right "pointer finger" where the first lesions appeared, and the other lesions then began to appear in an ascending manner. The physician prescribed a medication and warned him of gynecomastia as a side effect if taken for long periods of time. Which of the following is the mechanism of action of the medication? (B) Binds to ergosterol, forming destructive pores in cell membrane (D) Inhibits formation of beta glucan (A) Inhibits ergosterol synthesis (E) Disrupts microtubule function (C) Inhibits squalene epoxidase
Reason: The correct answer is (A) Inhibits ergosterol synthesis because the described nodular lesions and the history of a thorn prick suggest a fungal infection, possibly cutaneous sporotrichosis, which is commonly treated with antifungal medications. Many antifungals, such as ketoconazole or fluconazole, act by inhibiting ergosterol synthesis, a crucial component of fungal cell membranes, which can lead to treatment-related gynecomastia due to hormonal side effects from prolonged use.
Answer: (A) Inhibits ergosterol synthesis

Question: A 4-month-old girl is seen for ongoing lethargy and vomiting. She was born to a 31-year-old G2P2 mother with a history of hypertension. She has had 7 episodes of non-bloody, non-bilious vomiting and 3 wet diapers over the last 24 hours. Laboratory results are shown below.

Serum:
Na+: 132 mEq/L
Cl-: 100 mEq/L
K+: 3.2 mEq/L
HCO3-: 27 mEq/L
BUN: 13 mg/dL
Glucose: 30 mg/dL
Lactate: 2 mmol/L
Urine ketones: < 20 mg/dL

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? (D) Medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (C) Sphingomyelinase deficiency (E) Galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase deficiency (A) Glucose-6-phosphatase deficiency (B) Glucocerebrosidase deficiency
Reason: Medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD) is characterized by impaired fatty acid oxidation, leading to episodes of hypoglycemia, lethargy, vomiting, and increased levels of fatty acids in the blood. The patient’s laboratory results, including hypoglycemia (glucose: 30 mg/dL) and normal lactate levels, along with her age and symptoms, align with MCADD as the most likely diagnosis, as the condition typically presents with similar signs when the infant has not been adequately fed or is ill.
Answer: (D) Medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency

Question: A 57-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician with complaints of nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and bloating that have increased in severity over the past several months. She reports that she occasionally vomits after eating. She states that the emesis contains undigested food particles. Additionally, the patient states that she often is satiated after only a few bites of food at meals. Her medical history is significant for hypertension and type II diabetes mellitus. Initial laboratory values are notable only for a hemoglobin A1c of 14%. Which of the following is the best initial treatment for this patient? (C) Metoclopramide (E) Surgical resection (B) Erythromycin (A) Dietary modification (D) Myotomy
Reason: Dietary modification is the best initial treatment for this patient, as her symptoms suggest possible gastroparesis, which is commonly associated with diabetes. By changing her diet, such as eating smaller, more frequent meals that are easier to digest, she may experience relief from her nausea and vomiting without the need for medications or more invasive interventions initially.
Answer: (A) Dietary modification

Question: A 16-year-old teenager is brought to the emergency department after having slipped on ice while walking to school. She hit her head on the side of the pavement and retained consciousness. She was brought to the closest ER within an hour of the incident. The ER physician sends her immediately to get a CT scan and also orders routine blood work. The physician understands that in cases of stress, such as in this patient, the concentration of certain hormones will be increased, while others will be decreased. Considering allosteric regulation by hormones, which of the following enzymes will most likely be inhibited in this patient? (E) Glycogen phosphorylase (B) Phosphofructokinase (C) Glucose-6-phosphatase (A) Pyruvate carboxylase (D) Fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase
Reason: Phosphofructokinase (PFK) is a critical regulatory enzyme in glycolysis, and its activity is influenced by the levels of hormones such as insulin and glucagon, which change in response to stress. In stressful situations, the body typically increases levels of glucagon and epinephrine, leading to higher concentrations of ATP and citrate that can inhibit PFK, thereby regulating glucose metabolism and promoting gluconeogenesis over glycolysis to ensure that energy stores are preserved during stress.
Answer: (B) Phosphofructokinase

Question: A 14-year-old girl presents in with her mother to a physician’s office. They are both concerned with the amount of hair growing on the girl's upper lip and cheeks. There are also sparse hairs on her chest. The mother reports that her daughter has not started menstruating either. The girl was born at 39 weeks gestation via spontaneous vaginal delivery. She is up to date on all vaccines and is meeting all developmental milestones. On examination, the patient is in the 55th percentile for her height. Her blood pressure is 90/50 mm Hg, pulse is 75/min, and respirations are 15/min. There is thin dark hair on her upper lip and on her cheeks. She also has pustular acne on her face and shoulders. Her breasts are in the initial stages of development and she speaks with a deep voice describing her concerns to the physician. Based on her clinical history, which of the following enzymes are most likely deficient? (B) 17-α-hydroxylase (E) 5-α-reductase (D) 21-hydroxylase (C) Aromatase (A) 11-β-hydroxylase
Reason: The girl's symptoms suggest that she may have congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency, which is characterized by a lack of cortisol and aldosterone production. This deficiency leads to an accumulation of androgens, resulting in signs such as hirsutism, acne, and delayed menarche, fitting her clinical presentation.

Question: A researcher is studying the properties of an enzyme that adds phosphate groups to glucose. She discovers that the enzyme is present in most body tissues and is located in the cytoplasm of the cells expressing the enzyme. She decides to mix this enzyme under subphysiologic conditions with varying levels of glucose in order to determine the kinetic properties of the enzyme. Specifically, she adds increasing levels of glucose at a saturating concentration of phosphate and sees that the rate at which glucose becomes phosphorylated gets faster at higher levels of glucose. She observes that this rate approaches a maximum speed and calls this speed Y. She then determines the concentration of glucose that is needed to make the enzyme function at half the speed Y and calls this concentration X. Which of the following is most likely true about the properties of this enzyme? (E) Low X and low Y (A) High X and high Y (C) Low X and high Y (D) Low X and infinite Y (B) High X and low Y
Reason: In enzyme kinetics, a low X value (the Michaelis constant, Km) indicates that the enzyme has a high affinity for its substrate, which results in faster turnover at lower substrate concentrations. A low Y value (the maximum rate of reaction, Vmax) suggests that the enzyme is not very efficient or abundant, leading to a lower maximum reaction rate when the enzyme is saturated, thus supporting the conclusion of low X and low Y for this enzyme.
Answer: (E) Low X and low Y

Question: A case-control study looking to study the relationship between infection with the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis and having multiple sexual partners was conducted in the United States. A total of 100 women with newly diagnosed chlamydial infection visiting an outpatient clinic for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) were compared with 100 women from the same clinic who were found to be free of chlamydia and other STDs. The women diagnosed with this infection were informed that the potential serious consequences of the disease could be prevented only by locating and treating their sexual partners. Both groups of women were queried about the number of sexual partners they had had during the preceding 3 months. The group of women with chlamydia reported an average of 4 times as many sexual partners compared with the group of women without chlamydia; the researchers, therefore, concluded that women with chlamydia visiting the clinic had significantly more sexual partners compared with women who visited the same clinic but were not diagnosed with chlamydia. What type of systematic error could have influenced the results of this study? (B) Lost-to-follow-up bias (C) Response bias (A) Ascertainment bias (E) Reporting bias (D) Detection bias
Reason: Reporting bias might have influenced the results of this study because the women with chlamydia may have been more likely to overreport their number of sexual partners due to their awareness of the infection's implications. In contrast, women without the infection may have underreported their sexual activity, leading to a skewed comparison between the two groups regarding the number of sexual partners.
Answer: (E) Reporting bias

Question: A 63-year-old African American man presents to the emergency department with edema over his face and difficulty breathing. Past medical history is significant for hypertension and dyslipidemia. He recently began lisinopril and atorvastatin several weeks ago. His father died at 80 years from complications of a stroke and his mother lives in a nursing home. His blood pressure is 135/92 mm Hg, the heart rate is 101/min, the respiratory rate is 21/min, the temperature is 32.0°C (98.6°F). Clinical pathology results suggest a normal C1 esterase inhibitor level. Of the following options, which is the most likely diagnosis? (D) Drug-induced angioedema (C) Facial lymphedema (A) Scleredema (E) Contact dermatitis (B) Erysipelas
Reason: The presentation of facial edema and difficulty breathing, especially following the initiation of a medication like lisinopril, suggests an adverse reaction to the drug known as angioedema. The normal C1 esterase inhibitor level helps to rule out hereditary angioedema, making drug-induced angioedema the most likely diagnosis in this scenario.

Question: Two days after undergoing left hemicolectomy for a colonic mass, a 62-year-old man develops shortness of breath. His temperature is 38.1°C (100.6°F), pulse is 80/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 120/78 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 88%. Cardiopulmonary examination shows decreased breath sounds and decreased fremitus at both lung bases. Arterial blood gas analysis on room air shows:
pH 7.35
PaO2 70 mm Hg
PCO2 40 mm Hg
An x-ray of the chest shows a collapse of the bases of both lungs. Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's hypoxemia?" (E) Decreased chest wall compliance (C) Increased tidal volume (A) Increased anatomic dead space (B) Decreased hemoglobin oxygen-binding capacity (D) Decreased ratio of ventilated alveoli
Reason: This patient's presentation, including recent surgery, shortness of breath, hypoxemia, and chest x-ray findings showing lung collapse, indicates that the alveoli are not adequately ventilated, leading to impaired gas exchange. The decreased ratio of ventilated alveoli corresponds with the compromised lung function observed, particularly due to atelectasis following surgery, thereby explaining the hypoxemia.

Question: A 6-year-old girl is brought to the emergency department because of right elbow swelling and pain 30 minutes after falling onto her outstretched right arm. She has been unable to move her right elbow since the fall. Physical examination shows bruising, swelling, and tenderness of the right elbow; range of motion is limited by pain. An x-ray of the right arm shows a supracondylar fracture of the humerus with anterior displacement of the proximal fragment. Further evaluation is most likely to show which of the following findings? (A) Absent distal radial pulse (E) Inability to flex the elbow (B) Radial deviation of the wrist (C) Atrophy of the thenar eminence (D) Inability to abduct shoulder
Reason: The mechanism of injury, a fall onto an outstretched arm leading to a supracondylar fracture of the humerus, can result in potential complications such as brachial artery injury or vascular compromise. This could explain the absent distal radial pulse, which indicates impaired blood flow to the forearm and hand due to the fracture's displacement.

Question: A 26-year-old primigravida woman comes for her primary care physician for the second prenatal visit. She is 10 weeks pregnant. She has no current complaint except for occasional nausea. She does not have any chronic health problems. She denies smoking or alcohol intake. Her family history is positive for paternal colon cancer at the age of 55. Vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), blood pressure of 120/60 mm Hg, and pulse of 90/min. Physical examination discloses no abnormalities. According to the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), which of the following screening tests is recommended for this patient? (B) Glucose tolerance test for gestational diabetes mellitus (D) Colonoscopy for colorectal cancer at the age of 40 (E) HbA1C for type 2 diabetes mellitus (C) Urine culture for asymptomatic bacteriuria (A) Colonoscopy for colorectal cancer at the age of 50
Reason: Reasoning: Given the patient's familial history of paternal colon cancer at the age of 55, it is pertinent to initiate earlier screening for colorectal cancer. According to the USPSTF guidelines, individuals with a family history of colorectal cancer are recommended to begin screenings either at age 40 or 10 years earlier than the age at which the family member was diagnosed, thus making a colonoscopy at age 40 appropriate for this patient.

Question: A 60-year-old man comes to the clinic complaining of a persistent cough for the last few months. His cough started gradually about a year ago, and it became more severe and persistent despite all his attempts to alleviate it. During the past year, he also noticed some weight loss and a decrease in his appetite. He also complains of progressive shortness of breath. He has a 40-pack-year smoking history but is a nonalcoholic. Physical examination findings are within normal limits. His chest X-ray shows a mass in the right lung. A chest CT shows a 5 cm mass with irregular borders near the lung hilum. A CT guided biopsy is planned. During the procedure, just after insertion of the needle, the patient starts to feel pain in his right shoulder. Which of the following nerves is responsible for his shoulder pain? (C) Phrenic nerve (E) Thoracic spinal nerves (A) Intercostal nerves (B) Vagus nerve (D) Pulmonary plexus
Reason: Reasoning: The phrenic nerve is responsible for providing sensory innervation to the diaphragm and can also refer pain to areas such as the shoulder due to its anatomical pathway and the way the brain interprets pain signals. Given that the patient's shoulder pain occurred immediately after the needle was inserted, it's likely related to irritation or injury of the phrenic nerve during the biopsy procedure.
Answer: (C) Phrenic nerve

Question: A 4-day-old healthy male infant is born with normal internal and external male reproductive organs. Karyotype analysis reveals a 46XY genotype. Production of what substance by which cell type is responsible for the development of the normal male seminal vesicles, epididymides, ejaculatory ducts, and ductus deferens? (D) Testosterone; Leydig cells (B) Testis-determining factor; Leydig cells (A) Testis-determining factor; Sertoli cells (C) Testosterone; Sertoli cells (E) Mullerian inhibitory factor; Sertoli cells
Reason: Reasoning: Leydig cells in the testes are responsible for the production of testosterone, which is crucial for the development of male reproductive structures such as the seminal vesicles, epididymides, ejaculatory ducts, and ductus deferens. In a 46XY individual, the presence of testosterone stimulates the differentiation of these male genital structures, supporting the choice of Leydig cells as the source of the testosterone necessary for this development.
Answer: (D) Testosterone; Leydig cells

[INFO] Opinion paths:
Path 1: Let's think through the options step by step. The patient is experiencing a whistling noise when breathing through her nose following a rhinoplasty, which suggests an issue with airflow dynamics in the nasal cavity.

1. **Post-operative swelling (A)**: While swelling can cause some temporary changes in breathing, it is less likely to cause a whistling noise. 

2. **A deviated septum that is now straight (C)**: If a deviated septum has been corrected, this could potentially alter airflow, but it wouldn’t typically cause a whistling noise unless there is significant turbulence or a specific anatomical change, which is not the primary concern here.

3. **A fracture of the bony septum (E)**: A fracture could lead to complications, but it is less likely to be the direct cause of a whistling noise unless it resulted in a perforation or significant obstruction.

4. **A septal hematoma causing a perforation (B)**: A septal hematoma could lead to a perforation, which can cause a whistling noise when breathing due to the abnormal airflow through the perforation.

5. **Excessive columellar show resulting in increased nasal airflow (D)**: While changes in the columella can affect airflow, it’s less commonly associated with a whistling sound compared to a septal perforation.

Given the context of a post-operative situation where the patient is noticing a whistling noise, the most likely cause of this phenomenon is **(B) A septal hematoma causing a perforation**. This condition can create an abnormal airway passage that leads to the whistling sound during respiration. 

Final answer: **(B) A septal hematoma causing a perforation**.
Path 2: Let's analyze the options step by step to identify the most likely cause of the whistling noise during respiration after rhinoplasty.

1. **Post-operative swelling (A)**: While swelling can occur after surgery, it typically does not cause a whistling noise but may contribute to nasal obstruction or difficulty breathing.

2. **Excessive columellar show resulting in increased nasal airflow (D)**: This may alter the appearance of the nose, but it is less likely to specifically cause a whistling noise during respiration.

3. **A septal hematoma causing a perforation (B)**: A septal hematoma can lead to a perforation of the septum, which may result in a whistling noise as air passes through the perforation. This is a plausible cause.

4. **A fracture of the bony septum (E)**: While a fracture could potentially affect airflow, it is less likely to specifically cause a whistling sound compared to a perforation.

5. **A deviated septum that is now straight, resulting in altered nasal airflow (C)**: If the septum has been corrected and is straight, it is less likely to be the cause of the whistling noise, as a straight septum generally improves airflow rather than disrupts it.

Given the context of the question and the information provided, the most likely cause of the whistling noise during respiration is **(B) A septal hematoma causing a perforation**. 

**Answer: (B) A septal hematoma causing a perforation**.
Path 3: Let's analyze the situation step by step.

The patient is 3 months post-rhinoplasty and has developed a whistling noise during respiration through the nose. This noise suggests an issue with airflow in the nasal passages.

1. **Post-operative swelling (A)**: While swelling can occur post-surgery, it typically resolves within a few weeks, and would not likely cause a whistling noise after 3 months.

2. **Excessive columellar show (D)**: This refers to the positioning of the columella (the tissue between the nostrils) and could potentially affect airflow, but it is not a common cause of a whistling noise.

3. **A septal hematoma causing a perforation (B)**: A hematoma that forms and subsequently leads to a perforation of the septum could indeed cause a whistling noise due to abnormal airflow. However, this would typically present earlier than 3 months post-op and would likely cause other symptoms.

4. **A fracture of the bony septum (E)**: This could also cause issues with airflow, but it would likely be associated with significant nasal obstruction or deformity, and not just a whistling sound.

5. **A deviated septum that is now straight, resulting in altered nasal airflow (C)**: If the septum was previously deviated and is now corrected, the change in airflow dynamics could cause a whistling noise as the air passes through the newly straightened passage. 

Given the context of the surgery and the nature of the symptom, the most likely explanation for the whistling noise is due to altered airflow dynamics caused by the correction of the septum.

Therefore, the answer is: **(C) A deviated septum that is now straight, resulting in altered nasal airflow.**
Path 4: Let's analyze the options step by step. 

The patient is experiencing a "whistling noise" when breathing through her nose, which suggests an issue with airflow dynamics in the nasal passages. 

1. **Post-operative swelling (A)**: This is unlikely to cause a whistling noise. Swelling would typically obstruct airflow rather than create a sound.

2. **Excessive columellar show resulting in increased nasal airflow (D)**: While excessive columellar show can alter nasal aesthetics, it typically does not directly cause a whistling noise during respiration.

3. **A septal hematoma causing a perforation (B)**: A perforation of the septum could lead to abnormal airflow patterns, potentially causing a whistling sound. However, a septal hematoma is more likely to cause pain or obstruction rather than a specific noise.

4. **A fracture of the bony septum (E)**: This could potentially alter nasal airflow but is less common in rhinoplasty recovery unless there was a complication during the procedure.

5. **A deviated septum that is now straight, resulting in altered nasal airflow (C)**: If the septum was corrected during surgery, it could lead to changes in airflow dynamics, potentially causing a whistling sound as the air moves through the newly formed nasal passages.

Given this reasoning, the most likely cause of the whistling noise is related to the alteration in airflow due to the adjustments made during the rhinoplasty, specifically if the septum was corrected from a deviated position to a straight position.

**Answer: (C) A deviated septum that is now straight, resulting in altered nasal airflow.**
Path 5: Let's analyze the situation step by step. The patient is experiencing a whistling noise when she breathes through her nose following a rhinoplasty procedure. This whistling noise is typically associated with altered airflow through the nasal passages, which could result from several anatomical changes.

1. **A deviated septum that is now straight, resulting in altered nasal airflow (C):** While this could affect airflow, it is less likely to cause a whistling noise unless there are other factors involved.

2. **A fracture of the bony septum (E):** This could lead to complications but is less likely to be the direct cause of a whistling noise after three months of recovery.

3. **A septal hematoma causing a perforation (B):** A hematoma could lead to perforation of the septum, which can cause abnormal airflow, potentially resulting in a whistling sound. This is a strong possibility, especially post-surgery.

4. **Excessive columellar show resulting in increased nasal airflow (D):** While excessive columellar show can affect nasal aesthetics, it is not a typical cause of a whistling sound.

5. **Post-operative swelling (A):** Swelling could contribute to nasal obstruction but would not typically cause a whistling noise.

Considering these points, the most likely cause of the whistling noise is a septal hematoma that has led to a perforation, which can result in abnormal airflow through the nasal passages.

**Answer: (B) A septal hematoma causing a perforation.**
Path 6: Let's analyze the scenario step by step.

The patient is 3 months post-rhinoplasty and is experiencing a "whistling noise" when breathing through her nose. This whistling sound typically indicates that there is an alteration in airflow through the nasal passages. 

Now, let's evaluate the options:

(A) **Post-operative swelling** - While swelling can affect airflow, it usually resolves in a few weeks to months, and it is unlikely to cause a persistent whistling sound.

(B) **A septal hematoma causing a perforation** - A septal hematoma could lead to a perforation, which might cause abnormal airflow and sounds, but this is less common in the absence of other symptoms like pain or nasal obstruction.

(C) **A deviated septum that is now straight, resulting in altered nasal airflow** - This could potentially lead to a difference in airflow patterns, but it is less likely to specifically cause a whistling sound.

(D) **Excessive columellar show resulting in increased nasal airflow** - This is not typically associated with a whistling sound. 

(E) **A fracture of the bony septum** - This could cause structural changes leading to abnormal airflow, but it would likely also present with other symptoms.

Considering the timeline (3 months post-op) and the specific symptom of a whistling noise, the most likely cause would be:

**(B) A septal hematoma causing a perforation** - It is possible that during the healing process, a small perforation developed in the septum, which would lead to altered airflow and the whistling sound.

Therefore, the answer is:
**(B) A septal hematoma causing a perforation**.
Path 7: Let's analyze the situation step by step.

The patient is experiencing a "whistling noise" when she breathes through her nose following a rhinoplasty. This symptom is typically indicative of an abnormal airflow pattern in the nasal passages, which can occur due to various reasons.

1. **Post-operative swelling** (Option A) is generally temporary and would not typically cause a whistling noise after three months, as swelling should have resolved by that time.

2. **Excessive columellar show** (Option D) refers to the prominence of the columella (the tissue that separates the nostrils) and is more related to the aesthetic appearance than to airflow changes. It is unlikely to cause a whistling noise.

3. **A fracture of the bony septum** (Option E) could potentially cause issues, but it might not be the most likely cause for a whistling noise specifically.

4. **A deviated septum that is now straight** (Option C) would typically improve airflow rather than create a whistling noise. 

5. **A septal hematoma causing a perforation** (Option B) is known to result in a communication between the nasal cavities, which can lead to abnormal airflow and the characteristic whistling sound when breathing.

Given that the patient is three months post-surgery and has a persistent whistling noise, the most likely cause of this phenomenon is:

**Answer: (B) A septal hematoma causing a perforation**.
Path 8: Let's analyze the situation step by step. The patient is experiencing a whistling noise when breathing through her nose three months after rhinoplasty. This symptom typically indicates an issue with airflow through the nasal passages.

1. **Post-operative swelling (A)**: While swelling can occur after surgery, it usually resolves within a few weeks and is unlikely to be the cause of a persistent whistling noise three months later.

2. **Excessive columellar show (D)**: This could potentially affect airflow, but it typically does not cause a whistling noise. It refers to the visibility of the columella (the tissue between the nostrils) and is more related to aesthetic concerns than airflow.

3. **A deviated septum that is now straight (C)**: If the septum was previously deviated and is now straight, it is possible that the airflow dynamics have changed. However, this usually does not cause a whistling sound unless another issue is present.

4. **A fracture of the bony septum (E)**: A fracture could affect airflow, but it would likely present with other symptoms such as pain or persistent nasal obstruction.

5. **A septal hematoma causing a perforation (B)**: A septal hematoma can lead to necrosis and result in a perforation of the septum, which can cause abnormal airflow and a whistling noise when breathing.

Given the long time frame since the surgery and the specific symptom of whistling noise when breathing, the most likely cause of this phenomenon is:

**Answer: (B) A septal hematoma causing a perforation.**
Path 9: Let's think through the options step by step based on the context of the postoperative findings after rhinoplasty.

- **Option (C)**: A deviated septum that is now straight, resulting in altered nasal airflow. While a straightened septum can change airflow, it typically wouldn't cause a whistling noise.

- **Option (E)**: A fracture of the bony septum. This could potentially lead to complications, but it doesn't specifically relate to the whistling noise described.

- **Option (B)**: A septal hematoma causing a perforation. A septal hematoma can lead to a perforation in the septum, which could cause abnormal airflow and potentially a whistling sound.

- **Option (D)**: Excessive columellar show resulting in increased nasal airflow. While excessive columellar show can affect nasal aesthetics and airflow, it typically would not lead to a whistling noise.

- **Option (A)**: Post-operative swelling. This might affect airflow but would more likely lead to nasal congestion rather than a whistling sound.

Given that the patient is experiencing a whistling noise, the most likely cause is a **perforation** in the nasal septum, which can lead to altered airflow and result in audible sounds during respiration.

Therefore, the correct answer is: **(B) A septal hematoma causing a perforation.**
Path 10: Let's think through the options step by step.

The patient is experiencing a whistling noise during respiration through her nose three months after a rhinoplasty procedure. This suggests an abnormality in the airflow through the nasal passages.

1. **A deviated septum that is now straight, resulting in altered nasal airflow (C)**: While a straight septum may change airflow, it typically does not cause a whistling noise.

2. **A fracture of the bony septum (E)**: This could potentially lead to issues, but a fracture would typically result in more acute symptoms rather than a chronic whistling noise.

3. **A septal hematoma causing a perforation (B)**: A perforation in the nasal septum can lead to whistling sounds during respiration, as airflow through a perforation can create turbulence or noise.

4. **Excessive columellar show resulting in increased nasal airflow (D)**: Excessive columellar show is more about the aesthetic appearance of the nose rather than airflow issues.

5. **Post-operative swelling (A)**: Swelling could affect airflow but is less likely to cause a persistent whistling noise after three months.

Given this analysis, the most likely cause of the whistling noise is a **septal hematoma causing a perforation**, which would create an abnormal airflow pattern leading to the whistling sound.

Answer: (B) A septal hematoma causing a perforation

Question: A 34-year-old G3P2 undergoes colposcopy at 15 weeks gestation due to high-grade intraepithelial lesion detected on a Pap smear. She has no history of the gynecologic disease and had normal Pap smear results prior to the current pregnancy. The pelvic examination does not reveal any cervical lesions. Colposcopy shows a non-deformed cervix with a well-visualized transformation zone. Application of acetic acid reveals an area of acetowhite epithelium 2 cm in the largest diameter located at 6 o’clock with sharp irregular borders. A punch biopsy shows irregularly shaped tongues of pleomorphic squamous epithelium cells invading the stroma to a depth of 2 mm. Which of the following describes the proper management strategy for this patient? (E) Schedule a diagnostic lymphadenectomy (D) Perform radical trachelectomy (A) Perform a diagnostic conization (B) Terminate the pregnancy and perform a radical hysterectomy (C) Observe until 34 weeks of pregnancy
Reason: The answer to the management strategy for this patient is (A) Perform a diagnostic conization. This approach is appropriate because the biopsy indicates invasive cervical carcinoma that requires further evaluation and confirmation of the diagnosis while considering the patient's pregnancy status. A diagnostic conization allows for both treatment and assessment of the extent of the disease while preserving the pregnancy if possible.
Answer: (A) Perform a diagnostic conization

Question: A 17-year-old girl is brought to the emergency department by her father with fever, chills, and a body rash. Her father reports that 3 days ago, his daughter underwent surgery for a deviated nasal septum. Since then, she has been "sleepy" and in moderate pain. When the patient’s father came home from work today, he found the patient on the couch, shivering and complaining of muscle aches. He also noticed a rash all over her body. The patient says she feels “hot and cold” and also complains of lightheadedness. The patient has no other past medical history. She has been taking oxycodone for the post-surgical pain. She denies any recent travel. The father reports the patient’s brother had a minor “cold” last week. The patient’s mother has major depressive disorder. The patient denies tobacco or illicit drug use. She says she has tried beer before at parties. Her temperature is 103.2°F (39.6°C), blood pressure is 84/53, pulse is 115/min, respirations are 12/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. The patient is awake and oriented but slow to respond. There is no focal weakness or nuchal rigidity. Physical examination reveals nasal packing in both nostrils, tachycardia, and a diffuse, pink, macular rash that is also present on the palms and soles. Initial labs show a neutrophil-dominant elevation in leukocytes, a creatinine of 2.1 mg/dL, an aspartate aminotransferase of 82 U/L, and an alanine aminotransferase of 89 U/L. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the patient’s symptoms? (E) Polyclonal T-cell activation (D) Opioid receptor stimulation (A) Bacterial lysis (B) Circulating endotoxin (C) Mast cell degranulation
Reason: The answer to this patient's symptoms is (E) Polyclonal T-cell activation. This is indicated by the fever, rash, and signs of multi-organ involvement (such as elevated creatinine and liver enzymes), which are consistent with toxic shock syndrome, potentially due to a staphylococcal infection. In this context, polyclonal T-cell activation results from superantigens that lead to widespread immune activation, accounting for the systemic symptoms observed.
Answer: (E) Polyclonal T-cell activation

Question: A 71-year-old woman comes to her doctor because she is having trouble staying awake in the evening. Over the past year, she has noticed that she gets tired unusually early in the evenings and has trouble staying awake through dinner. She also experiences increased daytime sleepiness, fatigue, and difficulty concentrating. She typically goes to bed around 9 PM and gets out of bed between 2 and 3 AM. She does not have any trouble falling asleep. She takes 30-minute to 1-hour daytime naps approximately 3 times per week. She has no history of severe illness and does not take any medication. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? (C) Insomnia disorder (B) Depressive disorder (A) Advanced sleep phase disorder (E) Non-REM sleep arousal disorder (D) Delayed sleep phase disorder
Reason: The answer to this patient's symptoms is (A) Advanced sleep phase disorder. This diagnosis is suggested by her pattern of going to bed early (around 9 PM) and waking up very early in the morning (between 2 and 3 AM), which indicates a shift in her circadian rhythm toward an earlier phase. Her increased daytime sleepiness and difficulty staying awake in the evening further support this condition, as individuals with advanced sleep phase disorder often find themselves worn out earlier in the day.
Answer: (A) Advanced sleep phase disorder

Question: A 55-year-old man visits his primary care physician for a follow-up visit. He was diagnosed with asthma during childhood, but it has always been well controlled with an albuterol inhaler. He is hypertensive and admits that he is not compliant with his antihypertensive medication. He expresses his concerns about frequent headaches and blurry vision over the past few months. He has been taking acetaminophen for his headaches, but it has not made any difference. The blood pressure is 160/100 mm Hg, pulse rate is 77/min, and respiratory rate is 14/min. The BMI is 36.2 kg/m2. Physical examination is unremarkable. A urinalysis is notable for proteinuria. Funduscopic examination is shown on the right. Which pathologic mechanism best explains the changes seen in this patient’s fundoscopic examination? (B) Retinal hemorrhage (D) Neovascularization (C) Optic nerve inflammation (E) Microaneurysm formation (A) Papilledema
Reason: Papilledema is caused by increased intracranial pressure, which can result from uncontrolled hypertension and other factors such as proteinuria in this patient. The patient's elevated blood pressure and symptoms like headaches and blurry vision suggest possible chronic effects on the optic nerve, leading to swelling at the optic disc, which is indicative of papilledema seen during a fundoscopic examination.
Answer: (A) Papilledema

Question: A 39-year-old G3P0 woman presents for preconception counseling and evaluation. The patient’s past medical history reveals hypertension and type 1 diabetes. She is currently on an insulin pump and medications for hypertension including labetalol. Her blood pressure is 130/85 mm Hg; pulse, 76/min; and BMI, 26 kg/m2. Her most recent HbA1c is 6.5%. Her previous pregnancies ended in spontaneous abortion during the 1st trimester despite adequate prenatal care. The patient intends to have a healthy pregnancy and desires to learn more about the risk factors that potentially trigger miscarriage. Which of the following maternal risk factors is most likely associated with early pregnancy loss? (B) Diabetes (D) Age (C) Infection (A) Chronic hypertension (E) Hypercoagulable state
Reason: Age is a significant risk factor for early pregnancy loss, as advanced maternal age is associated with a higher likelihood of chromosomal abnormalities in embryos, which can lead to miscarriages. Although the patient has other medical conditions that can affect pregnancy outcomes, age remains one of the most well-established factors linked to increased risk of miscarriage, particularly in women over 35.
Answer: (D) Age

Question: A 36-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-week history of progressively worsening pain on the outer side of her left elbow. She does not recall any trauma to the area. The patient plays badminton recreationally. Examination shows tenderness over the lateral surface of the left distal humerus. The pain is reproduced by supinating the forearm against resistance. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's pain? (B) Nerve compression at the elbow (A) Excessive stress to bone (C) Bursal inflammation (D) Repeated wrist extension (E) Repeated wrist flexion
Reason: Repeated wrist extension leads to overuse of the extensor muscles, particularly the extensor carpi radialis brevis, which attach to the lateral epicondyle of the humerus. This overuse can result in inflammation and microtrauma, commonly known as lateral epicondylitis or "tennis elbow," which matches the patient's symptoms of lateral elbow pain and pain reproduced by resisting supination.
Answer: (D) Repeated wrist extension

Question: A 13-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of swelling around his eyes for the past 2 days. His mother also notes that his urine became gradually darker during this time. Three weeks ago, he was treated for bacterial tonsillitis. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 79/min, and blood pressure is 158/87 mm Hg. Examination shows periorbital swelling. Laboratory studies show:
Serum
Urea nitrogen 9 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.7 mg/dL
Urine
Protein 2+
RBC 12/hpf
RBC casts numerous
A renal biopsy would most likely show which of the following findings?" (E) Granular deposits of IgG, IgM, and C3 on immunofluorescence (D) Effacement of podocyte foot processes on electron microscopy (B) Splitting and alternating thickening and thinning of the glomerular basement membrane on light microscopy (A) """Spike-and-dome"" appearance of subepithelial deposits on electron microscopy" (C) Mesangial IgA deposits on immunofluorescence
Reason: The clinical scenario presented is suggestive of post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, which commonly occurs after an infection, such as bacterial tonsillitis. The presence of periorbital swelling, dark urine, and laboratory findings indicating proteinuria and red blood cell casts support this diagnosis, and the expected findings in renal biopsy would show granular deposits of immune complexes consisting of IgG, IgM, and complement component C3 due to the immune response following the streptococcal infection.
Answer: (E) Granular deposits of IgG, IgM, and C3 on immunofluorescence

Question: A 44-year-old woman with high blood pressure and diabetes presents to the outpatient clinic and informs you that she is trying to get pregnant. Her current medications include lisinopril, metformin, and sitagliptin. Her blood pressure is 136/92 mm Hg and heart rate is 79/min. Her physical examination is unremarkable. What should you do regarding her medication for high blood pressure? (A) Continue her current regimen (D) Discontinue lisinopril and initiate candesartan (E) Discontinue lisinopril and initiate aliskiren (C) Continue her current regimen and add a beta-blocker for increased control (B) Discontinue lisinopril and initiate labetalol
Reason: The correct course of action is to discontinue lisinopril, as it is an ACE inhibitor that is contraindicated during pregnancy due to its potential to cause adverse effects on fetal development, particularly affecting renal function. Labetalol is a preferred antihypertensive medication during pregnancy due to its safety profile and effectiveness in controlling blood pressure.
Answer: (B) Discontinue lisinopril and initiate labetalol

Question: A 25-year-old woman presents to her physician with a missed mense and occasional morning nausea. Her menstrual cycles have previously been normal and on time. She has hypothyroidism resulting from Hashimoto thyroiditis diagnosed 2 years ago. She receives levothyroxine (50 mcg daily) and is euthyroid. She does not take any other medications, including birth control pills. At the time of presentation, her vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 120/80 mm Hg, heart rate 68/min, respiratory rate 12/min, and temperature 36.5℃ (97.7℉). The physical examination shows slight breast engorgement and nipple hyperpigmentation. The gynecologic examination reveals cervical softening and increased mobility. The uterus is enlarged. There are no adnexal masses. The thyroid panel is as follows:
Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) 3.41 mU/L
Total T4 111 nmol/L
Free T4 20 pmol/L
Which of the following adjustments should be made to the patient’s therapy? (A) The patient is euthyroid, so no adjustments should be made (C) Discontinue levothyroxine (E) Increase levothyroxine dosage by 5% each week up, to 50% (B) Decrease levothyroxine dosage by 30%  (D) Increase levothyroxine dosage by 20%–30%
Reason: The correct adjustment to the patient's therapy is to (D) Increase levothyroxine dosage by 20%–30%. This is because the patient is likely to be experiencing increased demand for thyroid hormones during early pregnancy, as indicated by symptoms consistent with pregnancy (missed menses, morning nausea) and physical examination findings (breast engorgement, cervical softening, and uterine enlargement). Consequently, her current dosage of levothyroxine may be insufficient to meet the increased metabolic needs during this physiological state, hence the need to increase the dosage.
Answer: (D) Increase levothyroxine dosage by 20%–30%

Question: A 25-year-old woman presents into the clinic complaining of worsening malaise, hair loss, and a rash on her face. The patient states that she has been avoiding daylight because the rash becomes painful, and she has not been able to go to classes because of debilitating arthralgia in her fingers and ankles. No significant past medical history. She takes no medication. At the time of the consult, the patient has a fever of 39.0°C (102.2 °F). The presence of which of the following is most commonly seen on diagnostic labs in this patient’s most likely condition? (B) Anti-dsDNA (C) Anti-histone antibody (A) Anti-smith antibody (D) Anti-Ro antibody (E) Antinuclear antibody
Reason: The most commonly seen diagnostic lab finding in this patient's likely condition is (E) Antinuclear antibody (ANA). This is because the symptoms presented—such as facial rash, photosensitivity, and arthralgia—are indicative of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a condition associated with a positive ANA test in the majority of patients. While other antibodies may be present in SLE, ANA is the most prevalent initial screening test used in the diagnosis.
Answer: (E) Antinuclear antibody

Question: A 31-year-old male presents to the emergency room following an altercation with patrons at a local grocery store. He is acting aggressively toward hospital staff and appears to be speaking to non-existent individuals. On examination he is tachycardic and diaphoretic. Horizontal and vertical nystagmus is noted. The patient eventually admits to taking an illegal substance earlier in the evening. Which of the following mechanisms of action is most consistent with the substance this patient took? (E) NMDA receptor antagonist (B) Biogenic amine reuptake inhibitor (D) GABA agonist (C) Mu receptor agonist (A) Adenosine antagonist
Reason: The mechanism of action most consistent with the substance this patient took is (E) NMDA receptor antagonist. This is supported by the presence of symptoms such as aggression, hallucinations (speaking to non-existent individuals), tachycardia, diaphoresis, and particularly the noted nystagmus, which are characteristic of substances like phencyclidine (PCP) and ketamine, both of which are NMDA receptor antagonists. These compounds disrupt normal neurotransmission and can lead to the aggressive behavior and dissociative symptoms observed in this patient.
Answer: (E) NMDA receptor antagonist

Question: A 57-year-old woman comes to the physician because of several years of recurrent pelvic pain and constipation. She has increased fecal urgency and a sensation of incomplete evacuation following defecation. She has had no problems associated with urination. Her last menstrual period was 6 years ago. She has had three uncomplicated vaginal deliveries. Physical examination shows normal external genitalia. Speculum examination of the vagina and the cervix shows bulging of the posterior vaginal wall during Valsalva maneuver. Weakness of which of the following structures is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms? (D) Cardinal ligament (B) Rectovaginal fascia (C) Uterosacral ligament (E) Bulbospongiosus muscle (A) Pubocervical fascia
Reason: The patient's symptoms, including recurrent pelvic pain, fecal urgency, and the sensation of incomplete evacuation, along with the physical finding of bulging of the posterior vaginal wall, suggest a structural issue affecting the pelvic support system. The rectovaginal fascia provides essential support between the rectum and the vagina, and weakness in this structure can lead to rectocele, which aligns with her symptomatology.
Answer: (B) Rectovaginal fascia

Question: A 29-year-old G1P0 woman, at 12 weeks estimated gestational age, presents for her first prenatal visit. Past medical history reveals the patient has type O+ blood and that her husband has type A+ blood. The patient is worried about the risk of her baby having hemolytic disease. Which of the following is correct regarding fetomaternal incompatibility in this patient? (E) It is a rare cause of newborn hemolytic disease (A) It cannot affect first borns (C) Prenatal detection is very important because fetomaternal incompatibility is associated with severe fetal anemia (B) It is more severe than RhO (D) alloimmunization (D) A direct Coombs test is strongly positive
Reason: In this scenario, the woman has type O+ blood and her husband has type A+ blood, which means that the baby could inherit type A blood, but this combination generally leads to a milder incompatibility compared to Rh incompatibility. Therefore, fetomaternal incompatibility due to ABO blood type is less common and usually results in a less severe hemolytic disease in newborns, making it a relatively rare cause of this condition.
Answer: (E) It is a rare cause of newborn hemolytic disease

Question: A 53-year-old man with hyperlipidemia comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. His home medications include acetaminophen and atorvastatin. Serum studies show elevated total cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations. A drug that activates the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha is added to his existing therapy. This patient is most likely to develop which of the following drug-related adverse effects? (A) Waxing and waning confusion (C) Pruritus and flushing of the skin (B) Reddish-brown discoloration of urine (D) Bleeding from minor trauma (E) Acutely swollen and painful joint
Reason: The addition of a medication that activates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors alpha (such as a fibrate) to the patient's regimen can lead to increased levels of myoglobin or hemoglobin in the urine in the context of muscle toxicity. This can manifest as reddish-brown discoloration of urine, especially if there is underlying muscle injury or rhabdomyolysis due to the interaction with atorvastatin, which increases the risk of muscle-related side effects.
Answer: (B) Reddish-brown discoloration of urine

Question: A 7-month-old boy presents to the family physician with extensive scaliness and pigmentation of sun-exposed skin areas. His mother says that these symptoms were absent until mid-spring and then became significantly worse after their trip to California in the summer. The child was born in December to a consanguineous couple after an uncomplicated pregnancy. He is breastfed and receives mashed potatoes, bananas, and carrots as complementary foods. His weight is 8.5 kg (18.7 lb) and length is 70 cm (2 ft 96 in). The patient’s vital signs are within normal limits for his age. On physical examination, there is freckling, scaling, and erythema on the sunlight-exposed areas of the face, trunk, and upper and lower extremities. No blistering, scarring, hypertrichosis, or alopecia is noted. The rest of the exam is unremarkable. Which process is most likely disrupted in this patient? (A) Conversion of uroporphyrinogen III to coproporphyrinogen III (C) Base-excision DNA repair (E) Nucleotide-excision DNA repair (B) Hydroxylation of proline and lysine in the procollagen molecule (D) NAD production
Reason: The symptoms displayed by the 7-month-old boy, characterized by extensive scaliness and pigmentation changes in sun-exposed areas of the skin, suggest a sensitivity to UV light that may be related to a defect in DNA repair mechanisms. Nucleotide-excision DNA repair is crucial for repairing UV-induced DNA damage, and a disruption in this process can lead to conditions like xeroderma pigmentosum, which presents with similar skin findings.
Answer: (E) Nucleotide-excision DNA repair

Question: A 23-year-old woman comes to the physician because of vaginal discharge for 3 days. She has been sexually active with three male partners over the past year and uses condoms inconsistently. Her only medication is an oral contraceptive. Physical exam shows thin grayish-white vaginal discharge. There is no erythema of the vaginal mucosa. The pH of the discharge is 5.9. Adding potassium hydroxide (KOH) to a mount containing vaginal discharge produces a fishy odor. Further evaluation of this patient's vaginal discharge is most likely to show which of the following findings? (A) Pseudohyphae (E) Flagellated protozoa (B) Gram-variable rod (D) Gram-negative diplococci (C) Spiral-shaped bacteria
Reason: The presentation of thin grayish-white vaginal discharge with a pH of 5.9 and a fishy odor after the addition of KOH strongly suggests bacterial vaginosis, which is commonly caused by an overgrowth of Gardnerella vaginalis, a gram-variable rod. The characteristics of the discharge and odor are key indicators of this condition, leading to the conclusion that further evaluation will reveal the presence of Gram-variable rods.
Answer: (B) Gram-variable rod

Question: A 70-year-old woman comes to the physician for the evaluation of loss of urine for the last several months. She loses small amounts of urine without warning after coughing or sneezing. She also sometimes forgets the names of her relatives. She is retired and lives at an assisted-living facility. She has type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Her older sister recently received a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. She does not smoke or drink alcohol. Medications include metformin and enalapril. Vital signs are within normal limits. She walks without any problems. Sensation to pinprick and light touch is normal. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms? (B) Loss of sphincter control (D) Bacterial infection of the urinary tract (A) Detrusor overactivity (C) Urethral hypermobility (E) Decreased cerebrospinal fluid absorption
Reason: This patient’s loss of urine with activities such as coughing or sneezing indicates a stress urinary incontinence, which is typically caused by urethral hypermobility. This condition results in the loss of support for the urethra, leading to unintentional leakage during increased abdominal pressure, especially in an older woman with a history consistent with pelvic floor weakening.

Question: A 31 year-old-man presents to an urgent care clinic with symptoms of lower abdominal pain, bloating, bloody diarrhea, and fullness, all of which have become more frequent over the last 3 months. Rectal examination reveals a small amount of bright red blood. His vital signs include: temperature 36.7°C (98.0°F), blood pressure 126/74 mm Hg, heart rate 74/min, and respiratory rate 14/min. Colonoscopy is performed, showing extensive mucosal erythema, induration, and pseudopolyps extending from the rectum to the splenic flexure. Given the following options, what is the definitive treatment for this patient’s underlying disease? (A) Sulfasalazine (B) Mesalamine (C) Systemic corticosteroids (D) Azathioprine (E) Total proctocolectomy
Reason: In this scenario, the patient's symptoms and colonoscopy findings suggest a diagnosis of ulcerative colitis, particularly with extensive involvement (from the rectum to the splenic flexure) and the presence of pseudopolyps. Total proctocolectomy is the definitive treatment for patients with severe ulcerative colitis who do not respond adequately to medical therapy, particularly when there is a risk of complications such as cancer or when medical management fails.

Question: An 18-year-old woman comes to the physician because of worsening headache and exertional dyspnea for 6 days. Two months ago, she had a spontaneous abortion. Since then, she has had intermittent bloody vaginal discharge. Pelvic examination shows blood at the cervical os and a tender, mildly enlarged uterus. A urine pregnancy test is positive. An x-ray of the chest shows multiple round opacities in both lungs. Dilation and curettage is performed. Histopathology of the curettage specimen is most likely to show which of the following findings? (E) Trophoblast hyperplasia with mixture of edematous and normal villi (B) Poorly differentiated glandular cells with myometrial invasion (D) Glomeruli-like central blood vessels enveloped by germ cells (A) Whorled pattern of smooth muscle fibers surrounded by a pseudocapsule (C) Cytotrophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblasts without chorionic villi
Reason: The clinical picture presented is suggestive of a complete mole, a type of gestational trophoblastic disease that can occur following pregnancy. In a complete mole, the histopathological examination commonly reveals an absence of chorionic villi, with the presence of both cytotrophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblasts proliferating excessively, which aligns with the answer choice (C). This finding supports the diagnosis as complete moles are characterized by abnormal trophoblastic proliferation and absence of fetal tissues.
Answer: (C) Cytotrophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblasts without chorionic villi

Question: A 10-year-old girl with previously diagnosed sickle cell anemia presents to the emergency room with a low-grade fever, malaise, petechiae on her arms, and a rash on her face. She regularly takes hydroxyurea and receives blood transfusions to treat her condition. Her blood tests show a hemoglobin of 4.0 g/dL, MCV of 87 fl, and 2% reticulocyte count. An attempted bone marrow biopsy was  a dry, empty tap. What is the most likely diagnosis? (C) Anemia of chronic disease (A) Aplastic crisis (B) Gastrointestinal bleeding (E) Sequestration crisis (D) Reaction to the blood transfusions
Reason: The most likely diagnosis is aplastic crisis due to the combination of low hemoglobin, low reticulocyte count, and an empty bone marrow biopsy. The dry tap indicates that the bone marrow is not producing sufficient red blood cells, which is consistent with aplastic anemia rather than other options such as anemia of chronic disease or sequestration crisis.

She says his teachers have complained about him bullying other students at school, starting fights, and stealing other children’s lunch money. She also says that a neighbor down the street called her 6 months ago and reported that the patient had entered her yard and started viciously kicking her dog. He has no significant past medical history. He is in the 90th percentile for height and weight and has been meeting all developmental milestones. The patient is afebrile and his vital signs are within normal limits. Which of the following adult personality disorders does this patient’s diagnosis most likely predict? (D) Schizoid personality disorder (C) Antisocial personality disorder (B) Paranoid personality disorder (A) Avoidant personality disorder (E) Schizotypal personality disorder
Reason: The most likely prediction for this patient's future diagnosis is antisocial personality disorder, given his troubling behaviors that involve bullying, aggression, and a lack of empathy, which are consistent with early signs of conduct disorder. These behaviors, if they persist into adolescence and adulthood, may evolve into antisocial personality disorder, characterized by a disregard for the rights and feelings of others.
Answer: (C) Antisocial personality disorder

Question: A 37-year-old man presents to the emergency department for a persistent fever. The patient states he has felt unwell for the past week and has felt subjectively febrile. The patient has a past medical history of a suicide attempt and alcohol abuse. He is not currently taking any medications. The patient admits to using heroin and cocaine and drinking 5-8 alcoholic drinks per day. His temperature is 103°F (39.4°C), blood pressure is 92/59 mmHg, pulse is 110/min, respirations are 20/min, and oxygen saturation is 96% on room air. Cardiopulmonary exam is notable for a systolic murmur heard best along the left sternal border. Dermatologic exam reveals scarring in the antecubital fossa. Which of the following is the next best step in management? (C) CT scan (B) Chest radiograph (E) Vancomycin and gentamicin (A) Blood cultures (D) Ultrasound
Reason: The next best step in management for this patient is (A) Blood cultures. Given the patient's history of substance abuse, elevated temperature, and the presence of a murmur, there is a high suspicion for infective endocarditis, which commonly occurs in individuals with intravenous drug use. Blood cultures are critical for identifying pathogens and guiding antibiotic treatment in suspected cases of endocarditis.
Answer: (A) Blood cultures

Question: A 21-year-old male college student is brought to the emergency department by the campus police after he was found yelling at a bookshelf in the library. His roommate does not know of any prior episodes similar to this. His vital signs are within normal limits. The patient appears unkempt. On mental status examination, he talks very fast with occasional abrupt interruptions. He is agitated. He is disoriented to time and repeatedly tells the physician, “I hear the sun telling me that I was chosen to save the universe.” Urine toxicology screen is negative. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy? (E) Ziprasidone (C) Dexmedetomidine (B) Alprazolam (D) Valproic acid (A) Haloperidol
Reason: The most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient is (E) Ziprasidone. The patient's symptoms, including agitation, disorganized speech, and auditory hallucinations, suggest a possible acute psychotic episode, which can be managed effectively with an atypical antipsychotic like Ziprasidone. Additionally, the negative urine toxicology screen indicates that the symptoms may not be due to substance use, reinforcing the need for antipsychotic treatment.
Answer: (E) Ziprasidone

Question: A 26-year-old woman presents to her physician with a complaint of milk reduction. 2 months ago, she delivered a healthy girl from an uncomplicated pregnancy. The baby was exclusively breastfed until 1.5 months when the patient had to return to the workforce. She cannot breastfeed her daughter at work so she had to leave her with her grandmother and incorporated baby formula into her diet. She reports breast engorgement shortly after she switched to the described regimen which subsided soon. A week after she switched to such a regimen, she started to notice that she has less milk to feed her baby when she is at home. The patient does not report any other symptoms including weight change or mood disturbances. She has breast implants installed submuscularly using the inframammary approach. At the age of 12 years, she had a blunt chest trauma with breast involvement. After the pregnancy, she had a short course of cetirizine due to hay fever. At presentation, the patient’s vital signs are within normal limits. The patient’s breasts are slightly engorged with no skin color changes. There is no discharge on breast compression. Which of the following statements describes the cause of the patient’s condition? (B) Suppression of lactation by the medications (D) Failure of lactogenic ducts to develop (E) Obliteration of the ducts due to trauma (C) Insufficient breast emptying (A) Insufficient amount of glandular breast tissue
Reason: The cause of the patient's condition is (C) Insufficient breast emptying. The decrease in milk production is likely due to infrequent breastfeeding and inadequate stimulation of the breasts, leading to reduced milk supply. When the patient returned to work and started using formula, her breasts were not emptied frequently enough, causing a feedback mechanism that decreased milk production.
Answer: (C) Insufficient breast emptying

Question: A 44-year-old man presents to urgent care with severe vomiting. He states that he was at a camping ground for a party several hours ago and then suddenly began vomiting profusely. He denies experiencing any diarrhea and otherwise states he feels well. The patient only has a past medical history of lactose intolerance and hypertension managed with exercise and a low salt diet. His temperature is 99.3°F (37.4°C), blood pressure is 123/65 mmHg, pulse is 110/min, respirations are 14/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable only for tachycardia and diffuse abdominal discomfort. Which of the following foods is associated with the most likely cause of this patient's presentation? (C) Home-made ice cream (D) Refried rice (E) Unfiltered stream water (B) Fish (A) Egg salad
Reason: The answer is (A) Egg salad because the symptoms presented by the patient, including severe vomiting after eating, are indicative of foodborne illness, particularly one associated with improperly handled or stored foods. Egg salad, which contains eggs that may harbor Salmonella if not cooked or stored properly, is a well-known source of such infections and fits the scenario of sudden onset vomiting following consumption.
Answer: (A) Egg salad

Question: A 32-year-old man presents to the physician with a history of fever, malaise, and arthralgia in the large joints for the last 2 months. He also mentions that his appetite has been significantly decreased during this period, and he has lost considerable weight. He also informs the physician that he often experiences tingling and numbness in his right upper limb, and his urine is also dark in color. The past medical records show that he was diagnosed with an infection 7 months before and recovered well. On physical examination, the temperature is 37.7°C (99.8°F), the pulse rate is 86/min, the respiratory rate is 14/min, and the blood pressure is 130/94 mm Hg. Which of the following infections has most likely caused the condition the patient is suffering from? (D) Chlamydophila pneumoniae (B) Epstein-Barr virus infection (A) Hepatitis B virus (E) Yersinia enterocolitica (C) Mycoplasma pneumoniae
Reason: The answer is (A) Hepatitis B virus because the patient's symptoms, including fever, malaise, arthralgia, weight loss, and dark urine, are consistent with chronic hepatitis and possible liver dysfunction. Additionally, the history of a prior infection can suggest a link to Hepatitis B, which can lead to prolonged symptoms and complications such as arthralgia and weight loss due to hepatic involvement.
Answer: (A) Hepatitis B virus

Question: A 14-year-old girl comes to the physician for exertional leg pain. The pain began last week when she started jogging to lose weight. She is at the 5th percentile for height and 80th percentile for weight. Physical examination shows a broad neck with bilateral excess skin folds that extend to the shoulders, as well as a low-set hairline and ears. There is an increased carrying angle when she fully extends her arms at her sides. Pulses are palpable in all extremities; lower leg pulses are delayed. Which of the following additional findings is most likely in this patient? (D) Triphalangeal thumb (B) Absent uterus (E) Horseshoe adrenal gland (A) Ovarian dysgenesis (C) Mitral valve prolapse
Reason: The answer is (A) Ovarian dysgenesis because the clinical features described are consistent with Turner syndrome, characterized by short stature, broad neck, low-set ears, and skeletal abnormalities. Females with Turner syndrome often exhibit ovarian dysgenesis, resulting in primary amenorrhea and infertility due to the underdevelopment of the ovaries.
Answer: (A) Ovarian dysgenesis

[INFO] Opinion paths:
Path 1: Let's think step by step. A type 1 error, also known as a false positive, occurs when the null hypothesis is true, but the results of the study lead to its rejection. In simpler terms, it suggests that there is a significant effect or difference when, in reality, there is none.

Given the options provided:

- (D) is incorrect because a type 1 error is not defined by a specific beta level.
- (A) is incorrect because it refers to study power rather than the definition of type 1 error.
- (E) is incorrect as type 1 error is not directly dependent on the confidence interval but rather on the statistical testing process.
- (C) is incorrect because it describes a type 2 error instead of a type 1 error.
- (B) is correct because it accurately defines a type 1 error: it occurs when the null hypothesis is true but is rejected in error.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B) A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is true but is rejected in error.
Path 2: To determine the correct answer, let's clarify what a type 1 error is:

- A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is true, but the researchers incorrectly reject it. This means that they conclude there is a significant effect or difference when, in fact, there is none.

Now, let's evaluate the options:

(A) A type 1 error means the study is not significantly powered to detect a true difference between study groups. 
- This is incorrect; power refers to the ability of a study to detect a true effect if one exists, not to type 1 errors.

(B) A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is true but is rejected in error. 
- This is the correct definition of a type 1 error.

(C) A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is false, yet is accepted in error. 
- This describes a type 2 error, not a type 1 error.

(D) A type 1 error is a beta (β) error and is usually 0.1 or 0.2. 
- This is incorrect; beta errors (type 2 errors) are related to failing to reject a false null hypothesis, and the typical significance level (alpha, α) for type 1 errors is usually set at 0.05.

(E) A type 1 error is dependent on the confidence interval of a study. 
- While the confidence interval is related to the significance level, this statement is not accurate as a definition of a type 1 error.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: (B) A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is true but is rejected in error.**
Path 3: Let's think through the definitions and implications of a type 1 error. 

A type 1 error, also known as a false positive, occurs when the null hypothesis is rejected when it is actually true. In the context of this study, if the authors had encountered a type 1 error, it would mean that they concluded that mepolizumab was effective in reducing asthma exacerbations when, in fact, it was not.

Now, let's evaluate the options provided:

(A) A type 1 error means the study is not significantly powered to detect a true difference between study groups. - This statement is incorrect because a type 1 error does not relate to the power of the study; it pertains to mistakenly rejecting a true null hypothesis.

(B) A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is true but is rejected in error. - This statement is correct. It accurately describes a type 1 error.

(C) A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is false, yet is accepted in error. - This statement describes a type 2 error, not a type 1 error.

(D) A type 1 error is a beta (β) error and is usually 0.1 or 0.2. - This statement is incorrect; a type 1 error is not a beta error; it is an alpha (α) error.

(E) A type 1 error is dependent on the confidence interval of a study. - This statement is not accurate; while the confidence interval is related to the significance level (alpha), it does not define a type 1 error.

Given this analysis, the correct answer is:

**Answer: (B) A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is true but is rejected in error.**
Path 4: Let's analyze the options step by step to determine which statement is true regarding a type 1 error.

A type 1 error, also known as a "false positive," occurs when researchers conclude that there is an effect or difference when, in fact, there is none. This typically happens when the null hypothesis (which states that there is no effect or no difference) is true, but the study results indicate otherwise.

Now, let's evaluate each option:

(A) A type 1 error means the study is not significantly powered to detect a true difference between study groups.  
- This statement is incorrect. A type 1 error is about incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis, not about the power of the study.

(B) A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is true but is rejected in error.  
- This statement is **correct**. A type 1 error specifically refers to the situation where the null hypothesis is actually true (no difference or effect) but the study concludes that it is false.

(C) A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is false, yet is accepted in error.  
- This statement is incorrect. This describes a type 2 error (false negative), not a type 1 error.

(D) A type 1 error is a beta (β) error and is usually 0.1 or 0.2.  
- This statement is incorrect. A type 1 error is denoted by alpha (α), not beta (β). Beta refers to type 2 errors.

(E) A type 1 error is dependent on the confidence interval of a study.  
- This statement is somewhat misleading. While the confidence interval is related to the significance level (alpha), a type 1 error itself is more about the incorrect rejection of the null hypothesis.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is:

**(B) A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is true but is rejected in error.**
Path 5: Let's analyze the options step by step:

- **Type 1 Error**: This is a statistical term that refers to the incorrect rejection of a true null hypothesis. In simpler terms, it means concluding that there is an effect or difference when there is none.

Now, let's evaluate each option:

(A) A type 1 error means the study is not significantly powered to detect a true difference between study groups.  
- This is incorrect. A type 1 error is about rejecting a true null hypothesis, not about the power of the study.

(B) A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is true but is rejected in error.  
- This is correct. This is the definition of a type 1 error.

(C) A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is false, yet is accepted in error.  
- This is incorrect. This describes a type 2 error, not a type 1 error.

(D) A type 1 error is a beta (β) error and is usually 0.1 or 0.2.  
- This is incorrect. A type 1 error is denoted by alpha (α), not beta (β). Beta refers to type 2 error.

(E) A type 1 error is dependent on the confidence interval of a study.  
- This is somewhat misleading. While the confidence interval is related to the concept of type 1 error, it does not directly define it.

Given the definitions and analyses, the correct answer is:

**Answer: (B) A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is true but is rejected in error.**
Path 6: Let's think through the definitions and implications of a type 1 error. A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is true, but we incorrectly reject it, concluding that there is a significant effect when, in fact, there is none.

Now, let's evaluate the options provided:

(A) A type 1 error means the study is not significantly powered to detect a true difference between study groups. - This statement is incorrect. A type 1 error is not related to the power of the study.

(B) A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is true but is rejected in error. - This statement correctly describes a type 1 error.

(C) A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is false, yet is accepted in error. - This statement describes a type 2 error, not a type 1 error.

(D) A type 1 error is a beta (β) error and is usually 0.1 or 0.2. - This statement is incorrect. The beta error (type 2 error) is not related to type 1 error.

(E) A type 1 error is dependent on the confidence interval of a study. - While the confidence interval can relate to the significance level, this statement does not accurately define a type 1 error.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is:

**Answer: (B) A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is true but is rejected in error.**
Path 7: Let's analyze each option step by step to determine which statement is true if the authors had inadvertently encountered a type 1 error.

- **(D) A type 1 error is a beta (β) error and is usually 0.1 or 0.2.**
  - This statement is incorrect. A beta (β) error refers to a type 2 error, which occurs when the null hypothesis is false but is not rejected. Type 1 error is denoted by alpha (α), typically set at 0.05 or other values depending on the study design.

- **(A) A type 1 error means the study is not significantly powered to detect a true difference between study groups.**
  - This statement is incorrect. A type 1 error does not relate to the power of the study. Instead, it refers to incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true.

- **(E) A type 1 error is dependent on the confidence interval of a study.**
  - This statement is not accurate. While the confidence interval is related to the significance level, type 1 error itself is not directly dependent on the confidence interval—it is defined by the alpha level chosen for the study.

- **(C) A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is false, yet is accepted in error.**
  - This statement is incorrect. A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is true, but it is rejected in error.

- **(B) A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is true but is rejected in error.**
  - This statement is correct. A type 1 error (alpha error) happens when researchers conclude that there is an effect or a difference when, in fact, there isn't one.

Given this analysis, the correct answer is:

**Answer: (B) A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is true but is rejected in error.**
Path 8: To analyze the options regarding a type 1 error, let’s clarify what a type 1 error is:

A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is true, but we incorrectly reject it. In the context of this study, it would mean concluding that mepolizumab is effective in reducing asthma exacerbations when, in fact, it is not.

Now let's evaluate the options:

(D) A type 1 error is a beta (β) error and is usually 0.1 or 0.2. 
- This is incorrect. A type 1 error is represented by alpha (α), not beta (β), and it is typically set at 0.05, not 0.1 or 0.2.

(A) A type 1 error means the study is not significantly powered to detect a true difference between study groups.
- This is incorrect. Power relates to the ability to detect a true effect, whereas a type 1 error is about incorrectly rejecting a true null hypothesis.

(E) A type 1 error is dependent on the confidence interval of a study.
- This is misleading. While confidence intervals relate to the significance of findings, they do not define what a type 1 error is.

(C) A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is false, yet is accepted in error.
- This is incorrect. This describes a type 2 error. 

(B) A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is true but is rejected in error.
- This is correct. This is the definition of a type 1 error.

Based on this evaluation, the correct answer is:

**Answer: (B) A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is true but is rejected in error.**
Path 9: Let's analyze the statements regarding type 1 error step by step.

1. **Definition of Type 1 Error**: A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is true but is incorrectly rejected. This means that the study concludes there is a significant effect or difference when in fact there is none.

2. **Evaluating the Options**:
   - (D) A type 1 error is a beta (β) error and is usually 0.1 or 0.2. 
     - This is incorrect. A type 1 error is associated with alpha (α), not beta (β). Beta errors relate to type 2 errors, which occur when a false null hypothesis is not rejected.
   
   - (A) A type 1 error means the study is not significantly powered to detect a true difference between study groups.
     - This is incorrect. A type 1 error is about incorrectly rejecting a true null hypothesis, not about the power of the study.
   
   - (E) A type 1 error is dependent on the confidence interval of a study.
     - This is somewhat misleading. While a type 1 error relates to the significance level (alpha), it is not directly dependent on the confidence interval itself, which is a different statistical concept.
   
   - (C) A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is false, yet is accepted in error.
     - This is incorrect. This describes a type 2 error, not a type 1 error.
   
   - (B) A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is true but is rejected in error.
     - This is the correct definition of a type 1 error.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is:

**Answer: (B) A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is true but is rejected in error.**
Path 10: A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is true, but the results of the study lead to its rejection. In the context of this clinical trial, if the authors had encountered a type 1 error, it would mean that they concluded that mepolizumab was effective in reducing asthma exacerbations when, in reality, it was not.

Thus, the correct answer is:

(B) A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is true but is rejected in error.

Question: A 50-year-old man comes to the physician for his annual health maintenance examination. The patient feels well. He has a history of hypertension, for which he currently takes lisinopril. He has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for 20 years. He drinks 5–6 beers on weekends. He is 181 cm tall (5 ft 11 in), weighs 80 kg (176.4 lbs); BMI is 24.6 kg/m2. His pulse is 75/min, blood pressure is 140/85 mm Hg, and respirations are 18/min. Physical examination is unremarkable. Laboratory studies show:
Total cholesterol 263 mg/dL
High-density lipoprotein cholesterol 36 mg/dL
Triglycerides 180 mg/dL
In addition to dietary and lifestyle modification, administration of which of the following agents is the most appropriate next step in management?" (C) HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (E) Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha activator (A) Cholesterol absorption inhibitor (D) Bile acid resins (B) Proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin 9 inhibitor
Reason: The most appropriate next step in this case is (C) HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor because the patient has elevated total cholesterol (263 mg/dL) and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels (36 mg/dL), placing him at an increased risk for cardiovascular disease. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, commonly known as statins, are effective in lowering LDL cholesterol and improving overall lipid profiles, particularly in individuals with established cardiovascular risk factors like hypertension and a history of smoking.
Answer: (C) HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor

Question: A 34-year-old man presents with a 2-day history of loose stools, anorexia, malaise, and abdominal pain. He describes the pain as moderate, cramping in character, and diffusely localized to the periumbilical region. His past medical history is unremarkable. He works as a wildlife photographer and, 1 week ago, he was in the Yucatan peninsula capturing the flora and fauna for a magazine. The vital signs include blood pressure 120/60 mm Hg, heart rate 90/min, respiratory rate 18/min, and body temperature 38.0°C (100.4°F). Physical examination is unremarkable. Which of the following is a characteristic of the microorganism most likely responsible for this patient’s symptoms? (E) Disabling Gi alpha subunit (D) Overactivation of guanylate cyclase (A) Production of lecithinase (C) Presynaptic vesicle dysregulation (B) Inactivation of the 60S ribosomal subunit
Reason: The answer is (D) Overactivation of guanylate cyclase because the patient’s symptoms suggest a gastrointestinal infection, most likely caused by an enterotoxin-producing organism, such as certain strains of Escherichia coli (e.g., enterotoxigenic E. coli). These organisms produce toxins that stimulate guanylate cyclase, leading to increased secretion of electrolytes and water into the intestinal lumen, resulting in watery diarrhea, which fits the patient’s presentation of loose stools and abdominal pain.
Answer: (D) Overactivation of guanylate cyclase

Question: A 34-year-old man comes to the physician because of foul-smelling diarrhea, fatigue, and bloating for 6 months. During this time, he has had a 5-kg (11-lb) weight loss without a change in diet. He has type 1 diabetes mellitus that is well-controlled with insulin. Examination shows conjunctival pallor and inflammation of the corners of the mouth. The abdomen is soft, and there is diffuse tenderness to palpation with no guarding or rebound. His hemoglobin concentration is 10.4 g/dL. The patient undergoes upper endoscopy. A photomicrograph of tissue from an intestinal biopsy is shown. Which of the following is most likely to improve this patient's symptoms? (C) Surgical resection of the colon (B) Avoidance of certain types of cereal grains (A) Treatment with ceftriaxone (D) Reduced intake of milk proteins (E) Supplemention of pancreatic enzymes
"
Reason: The most likely answer is (B) Avoidance of certain types of cereal grains because the patient presents with symptoms suggestive of celiac disease, including foul-smelling diarrhea, bloating, and weight loss, which often occur after the ingestion of gluten-containing grains. In cases of celiac disease, avoiding gluten is essential for symptom improvement and intestinal healing, as continued exposure can lead to further gastrointestinal damage and malabsorption.

Question: A 44-year-old G2P2 African American woman presents to her gynecologist for dysmenorrhea. She reports that for the past few months, she has been having severe pain during her menses. She also endorses menstrual bleeding that has been heavier than usual. The patient reports that her cycles are regular and occur every 30 days, and she denies both dyspareunia and spotting between her periods. Her last menstrual period was two weeks ago. In terms of her obstetric history, the patient had two uncomplicated pregnancies, and she had no difficulty becoming pregnant. She has never had an abnormal pap smear. Her past medical history is otherwise significant for hyperlipidemia and asthma. On physical exam, the patient’s uterus is tender, soft, and enlarged to the size of a pregnant uterus at 10 weeks of gestation. She is non-tender during vaginal exam, without cervical motion tenderness or adnexal masses. Her BMI is 24 kg/m2. A urine pregnancy test is negative.

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis for this patient? (B) Malignant invasion of endometrial cells into uterine myometrium (D) Presence of endometrial glands and stroma outside the uterus (E) Benign smooth muscle tumor of the uterus (C) Presence of endometrial glands and stroma in uterine myometrium (A) Hyperplastic overgrowths of endometrial glands and stroma
Reason: The most likely diagnosis for this patient is (C) Presence of endometrial glands and stroma in uterine myometrium, commonly known as adenomyosis. The patient's presentation of severe dysmenorrhea, heavy menstrual bleeding, an enlarged and tender uterus, coupled with the negative pregnancy test, suggests that the endometrial tissue is invading the myometrium, which is characteristic of adenomyosis. This condition often presents with similar symptoms, especially in women who have had previous childbirths.
Answer: (C) Presence of endometrial glands and stroma in uterine myometrium

Question: A 55-year-old male presents with complaints of intermittent facial flushing. He also reports feeling itchy after showering. On review of systems, the patient says he has been having new onset headaches recently. On physical exam, his vital signs, including O2 saturation, are normal. He has an abnormal abdominal mass palpable in the left upper quadrant. A complete blood count reveals: WBCs 6500/microliter; Hgb 18.2 g/dL; Platelets 385,000/microliter. Which of the following is most likely responsible for his presentation? (B) Fibrosis of bone marrow (E) Chronic hypoxemia (C) Tyrosine kinase mutation (A) Elevated serum erythropoietin levels (D) BCR-ABL fusion
Reason: The most likely cause of this patient's presentation is (C) Tyrosine kinase mutation, which is characteristic of conditions such as polycythemia vera (PV). The patient exhibits signs of increased red blood cell mass (elevated hemoglobin level), alongside symptoms like flushing and itching, which are common in PV due to increased blood viscosity and histamine release; this condition is frequently associated with a mutation in the JAK2 gene, a type of tyrosine kinase.
Answer: (C) Tyrosine kinase mutation

Question: Sixteen hours after delivery, a newborn develops respiratory distress. She was born at 38 weeks' gestation with a birth weight of 3200 g (7 lb 1 oz). Pregnancy was complicated by polyhydramnios. Physical examination shows tachypnea and bluish discoloration of the extremities. Auscultation of the chest shows diffuse crackles in the lung fields and a harsh holosystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border. Abdominal x-ray shows absence of bowel gas. Which of the following best explains the pathogenesis of this newborn's condition? (A) Defect in the pleuroperitoneal membrane (C) Defect in mesodermal differentiation (D) Absence of dynein (B) Deletion in the long arm of chromosome 7 (E) Deletion in the long arm of chromosome 22
Reason: The best explanation for this newborn's condition is (C) Defect in mesodermal differentiation, which may be indicative of congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH). The combination of respiratory distress, the presence of absent bowel gas suggesting intra-thoracic displacement of abdominal contents, and the physical exam findings are characteristic of CDH, which arises due to a failure in the proper formation and differentiation of the mesodermal structures that form the diaphragm. This defect leads to improper development of the diaphragm, allowing abdominal contents to move into the thoracic cavity, thus compromising lung development and function.
Answer: (C) Defect in mesodermal differentiation

Vital signs are within normal limits. On physical examination, the spine is nontender without paravertebral muscle spasms. Range of motion is normal. A straight-leg raise test is negative. After the physical examination has been completed, the patient asks for a letter to his employer attesting to his inability to work as a storekeeper. Which of the following is the most appropriate response? (A) “Yes. Since work may worsen your condition, I would prefer that you stay home a few days. I will write a letter to your employer to explain the situation.” (D) """The physical exam findings do not match your symptoms, which suggests a psychological problem. I would be happy to refer you to a mental health professional.""" (B) """You say you are in severe pain. However, the physical examination findings do not suggest a physical problem that can be addressed with medications or surgery. I'd like to meet on a regular basis to see how you're doing.""" (C) """I understand that you are uncomfortable, but the findings do not match the severity of your symptoms. Let's talk about the recent changes at your job.""" (E) """The physical exam findings suggest a psychological rather than a physical problem. But there is a good chance that we can address it with cognitive-behavioral therapy."""
Reason: The answer is (C) """I understand that you are uncomfortable, but the findings do not match the severity of your symptoms. Let's talk about the recent changes at your job.""" because it acknowledges the patient's discomfort while also addressing the discrepancy between his reported pain severity and the physical examination findings. This approach opens up a dialogue to explore potential non-physical causes for his pain, such as stress related to his job change, while not immediately validating his request for a work absence without further assessment.

Question: A 28-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 1-year history of chronic back pain. He explains that the pain started after getting a job at a logistics company. He does not recall any trauma and does not have morning stiffness or neurological symptoms. He has been seen by two other physicians for his back pain who did not establish a diagnosis. The patient also has abdominal bloating and a feeling of constipation that started 3 weeks ago. After doing extensive research on the internet, he is concerned that the symptoms might be caused by pancreatic cancer. He would like to undergo a CT scan of his abdomen for reassurance. He has a history of episodic chest pain, for which he underwent medical evaluation with another healthcare provider. Tests showed no pathological results. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. He reports that he is under significant pressure from his superiors due to frequent performance evaluations. He takes daily multivitamins and glucosamine to prevent arthritis. His vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows a soft, non-tender, non-distended abdomen and mild bilateral paraspinal muscle tenderness. The remainder of the examination, including a neurologic examination, shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies are within the reference range. An x-ray of the spine shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this patient's symptoms? (D) Somatic symptom disorder (C) Irritable bowel syndrome (A) Malignant neoplasm (E) Acute stress disorder (B) Atypical depression
Reason: The answer is (D) Somatic symptom disorder because the patient presents with chronic back pain and gastrointestinal symptoms that have no identifiable medical cause despite thorough evaluation, as well as concern about serious illness influenced by stress. This pattern suggests that his symptoms are likely being exacerbated by psychological factors, indicative of somatic symptom disorder, where psychological distress manifests as physical symptoms.

Question: An 84-year-old woman is brought to the physician by her son after he found her trying to hang herself from the ceiling because she felt that she was a burden to her family. Her family says that for the past 2 months she has had no energy to leave her room, has been sleeping most of the day, has lost 10 kg (22 lb), and cries every day. She was diagnosed with breast cancer that has metastasized to the liver 4 months ago. She moved in with her son and daughter-in-law shortly after the diagnosis. She initially underwent chemotherapy but discontinued the treatment when the metastases spread to the spine and brain. Her life expectancy is 1–2 weeks and she is currently receiving home-hospice care. Her only current medication is a fentanyl patch. She is 160 cm (5 ft 3 in) tall and weighs 46 kg (101.4 lb); BMI is 18 kg/m2. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows slow speech, a flat affect, and depressed mood. Which of the following treatments is initially most likely to provide the greatest benefit for this patient? (B) Electroconvulsive therapy (A) Methylphenidate (D) Fluoxetine (C) Megestrol (E) Bupropion
Reason: Methylphenidate is a stimulant medication that can help improve mood and energy levels, particularly in patients who are experiencing significant fatigue and lack of motivation, as noted in this woman's case. Given her severe depression, combined with terminal cancer and treatment cessation, a stimulant would likely provide her with a more immediate benefit in alleviating some depressive symptoms while the options for long-term antidepressant therapy, like fluoxetine or bupropion, may take longer to show effects.

Question: A 33-year-old woman presents to her local clinic in rural eastern India complaining of neck pain and fever. She reports a 4 day history of severe neck pain, neck stiffness, mild diarrhea, and fever. She has not taken her temperature. She works as a laborer and frequently carries heavy weights on her back. She is prescribed a medication and told to come back if her symptoms do not improve. Her symptoms resolve after a couple days. Six months later, she gives birth to a newborn male at 34 weeks gestation. His temperature is 97.8°F (36.6°C), blood pressure is 90/55 mmHg, pulse is 110/min, and respirations are 24/min. On examination, the baby is irritable with a weak cry. Ashen gray cyanosis is noted diffusely. What the is the mechanism of action of the drug responsible for this child’s presentation? (B) DNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitor (E) 50S ribosomal subunit inhibitor (C) DNA gyrase inhibitor (D) 30S ribosomal subunit inhibitor (A) Dihydropteroate synthase inhibitor
Reason: The symptoms presented in the newborn, including irritability, weak cry, and cyanosis, suggest the possibility of drug exposure during pregnancy that affected the baby's development. The description fits with an antibiotic such as chloramphenicol, which is a 50S ribosomal subunit inhibitor and can lead to "gray baby syndrome" when used in pregnant women, causing the infant's inability to metabolize the drug properly, leading to symptoms of toxicity.

Question: A 51-year-old woman presents to her primary care doctor with diarrhea. She has had 3-10 malodorous and loose bowel movements daily for the last 6 months, though she recalls that her bowel movements started increasing in frequency nearly 2 years ago. She was otherwise healthy until 2 years ago, when she had multiple elevated fasting blood glucose levels and was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus. She was also hospitalized once 6 months ago for epigastric pain that was determined to be due to cholelithiasis. She is an avid runner and runs 3-4 marathons per year. She is a vegetarian and takes all appropriate supplements. Her body mass index is 19 kg/m^2. She has lost 10 pounds since her last visit 18 months ago. On exam, she has dry mucous membranes and decreased skin turgor. A high-resolution spiral computerized tomography scan demonstrates a 5-cm enhancing lesion in the head of the pancreas. Additional similar lesions are found in the liver. Further laboratory workup confirms the diagnosis. The patient is offered surgery but refuses as she reportedly had a severe complication from anesthesia as a child. This patient should be treated with a combination of octreotide, 5-fluorouracil, and which other medication? (E) Methotrexate (A) Streptozotocin (B) Insulin (D) Glucagon (C) Paclitaxel
Reason: Streptozotocin is a chemotherapy agent that has demonstrated efficacy in treating pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, particularly in patients who have insulinomas or other pancreatic malignancies. In this case, the patient has a pancreatic lesion that is likely a neuroendocrine tumor given her symptoms of diarrhea and weight loss, and the combination of octreotide (which reduces hormone secretion) and streptozotocin would be appropriate to target the tumor while controlling symptoms.

Question: A 62-year-old woman is hospitalized after a recent viral illness complicated by congestive heart failure. She has a past medical history of obesity and hypertension controlled on lisinopril but was otherwise healthy until she developed fatigue and edema after a recent viral illness. In the hospital, she is started on furosemide to manage her fluid status. On day 5 of her admission, the patient’s temperature is 100.0°F (37.8°C), blood pressure is 136/88 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, and respirations are 14/min. The patient continues to have normal heart sounds, but with crackles bilaterally on lung auscultation. Edema is 3+ up to the bilateral knees. On labs, her leukocyte count is now 13,000/mm^3, up from 9,000/mm^3 the day before. Differential shows that this includes 1,000 eosinophils/mm^3. Creatinine is 1.7 mg/dL from 1.0 mg/dL the day before. Which of the following is most likely expected on urinary analysis? (B) Crystals (D) Nitrites positive (E) Red blood cell casts (A) Bacteria > 100 CFU/mL (C) Leukocyte esterase positive
Reason: The most likely expected finding on urinary analysis in this patient is "Leukocyte esterase positive." This is because the elevated leukocyte count, particularly with the presence of eosinophils, suggests an inflammatory or infectious process, which is commonly associated with urinary tract infections (UTIs) or pyelonephritis. The patient's symptoms of edema, increased creatinine, and crackles in the lungs might also indicate kidney involvement or fluid overload, which can correlate with urinary changes indicative of infection.

Mask ventilation with 100% oxygen is begun, but ten minutes after delivery the baby continues to appear cyanotic. His temperature is 37.2°C (99.0°F), pulse is 155/min, respirations are 65/min, and blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on 100% oxygen mask ventilation shows an oxygen saturation of 83%. Breath sounds are normal on the right and absent on the left. Heart sounds are best heard in the right midclavicular line. The abdomen appears concave. An x-ray of the chest is shown below. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial step in the management of this patient? (C) Surgical repair (B) Surfactant administration (E) Intubation and mechanical ventilation
" (A) Extracorporeal life support (D) Chest tube placement
Reason: The most appropriate initial step in the management of this patient is "Intubation and mechanical ventilation." Given the significant respiratory distress, low oxygen saturation despite 100% oxygen, and the absence of breath sounds on the left, these findings suggest potential severe respiratory failure, likely secondary to a condition such as tension pneumothorax or congenital diaphragmatic hernia. Intubation ensures adequate ventilation and oxygenation, which is critical to stabilize the infant before further interventions can be taken.

Question: A 63-year-old man undergoes uncomplicated laparascopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis and is admitted to the surgical ward for postoperative management. On postoperative day 1, routine laboratory studies reveal an increase in serum creatinine to 1.46 mg/dL from 0.98 mg/dL before the operation; BUN is 37 mg/dL, increased from 18 mg/dL on prior measurement; K is 4.8 mEq/L and CO2 is 19 mEq/L. The patient has an indwelling urinary catheter in place, draining minimal urine over the last few hours. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? (B) Evaluate urinary catheter for obstruction (C) Administer IV fluid bolus (D) Obtain bilateral renal ultrasonography (E) Initiate emergent hemodialysis (A) Obtain urinalysis
Reason: Evaluating the urinary catheter for obstruction is the most appropriate next step because the patient's minimal urine output, along with the rising serum creatinine and BUN levels, suggests possible acute kidney injury which could be caused by urinary retention due to obstruction. Ensuring proper urinary drainage can help determine if the issue is related to the urinary system before proceeding with more invasive interventions or treatments.
Answer: (B) Evaluate urinary catheter for obstruction

Question: A 31-year-old obese Caucasian female presents to the Emergency Department late in the evening for left lower quadrant pain that has progressively worsened over the last several hours. She describes the pain as sharp and shooting, coming and going. Her last bowel movement was this morning. She has also had dysuria and urgency. Her surgical history is notable for gastric bypass surgery 2 years prior and an appendectomy at age 9. She is sexually active with her boyfriend and uses condoms. Her temperature is 99.5 deg F (37.5 deg C), blood pressure is 151/83 mmHg, pulse is 86/min, respirations are 14/minute, BMI 32. On physical exam, she has left lower quadrant tenderness to palpation with pain radiating to the left groin and left flank tenderness on palpation. Her urinalysis shows 324 red blood cells/high power field. Her pregnancy test is negative. What is the next best step in management? (B) Intravenous pyelogram (E) Exploratory laparoscopy (C) Transvaginal ultrasound (D) Noncontrast CT scan (A) A KUB (kidneys, ureters and bladder) plain film
Reason: A noncontrast CT scan is the most appropriate next step in management because it is the best imaging modality to evaluate for renal stones, which could explain the patient's left lower quadrant pain and the presence of hematuria on urinalysis. Additionally, given her surgical history and the potential for various abdominal and pelvic pathologies, a CT scan can help rule out other acute conditions while providing comprehensive information about the urinary tract.
Answer: (D) Noncontrast CT scan

[INFO] Opinion paths:
Path 1: Let's analyze the symptoms step by step. 

The patient is showing unusual movements, specifically smacking motions with his lips, mouth-pursing, and excessive blinking. These symptoms have developed slowly over a period of 2 weeks and have become more pronounced. 

1. **Tardive dyskinesia** is characterized by involuntary, repetitive body movements, often involving the face and mouth (like lip smacking). It typically occurs after prolonged use of antipsychotic medications, particularly the typical ones like haloperidol.
  
2. **Pseudoparkinsonism** would involve rigidity, bradykinesia, and tremors, which are not described in this patient's symptoms.

3. **Acute dystonia** refers to sustained muscle contractions or abnormal postures, which is not what is described here.

4. **Akathisia** involves a feeling of inner restlessness and an uncontrollable need to be in motion, which is not indicated in this scenario.

5. **Palsy** generally refers to paralysis or weakness and does not apply here.

Considering the gradual onset of these specific movements after prolonged haloperidol use, the most accurate description of the patient's symptoms is:

**Answer: (B) Tardive dyskinesia.**
Path 2: Let's analyze the symptoms presented in the question step by step.

The patient exhibits:
- Unusual lip smacking motions
- Pursing of the mouth
- Excessive blinking
- Symptoms started slowly about 2 weeks ago
- Symptoms have become more pronounced

These symptoms are consistent with tardive dyskinesia, a condition that can occur after prolonged use of antipsychotic medications (such as haloperidol). Tardive dyskinesia is characterized by repetitive, involuntary movements, often involving the face, lips, and tongue.

Now, let's evaluate the options:
- (A) Akathisia: This refers to a feeling of inner restlessness and an uncontrollable need to be in constant motion, which does not match the symptoms described.
- (B) Tardive dyskinesia: This matches the involuntary movements and is a well-known side effect of long-term antipsychotic use.
- (C) Acute dystonia: This refers to sudden muscle contractions and abnormal postures, typically occurring shortly after starting or increasing the dose of antipsychotics, which does not fit here.
- (D) Pseudoparkinsonism: This refers to symptoms resembling Parkinson's disease (e.g., tremors, rigidity) and does not match the lip smacking or blinking.
- (E) Palsy: This is a general term for paralysis or weakness and does not apply to the symptoms described.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is:

**Answer: (B) Tardive dyskinesia**
Path 3: Let's analyze the symptoms and the context provided step by step.

1. **Patient Background**: The patient is a 61-year-old man with schizophrenia who has been treated with haloperidol, an antipsychotic medication. 

2. **Symptoms**: The patient exhibits unusual lip-smacking motions, mouth-pursing, and excessive blinking. These symptoms have been developing slowly over the past 2 weeks and have become more pronounced.

3. **Symptom Characteristics**:
   - **Lip-smacking and mouth-pursing** are indicative of involuntary movements.
   - The symptoms do not seem to bother the patient, suggesting they are not acute or distressing to him.

4. **Clinical Context**: Given the use of haloperidol, which is a typical antipsychotic, we must consider side effects associated with long-term use.

5. **Differential Diagnosis**:
   - **Tardive dyskinesia**: This is characterized by involuntary, repetitive movements, often involving the face (such as lip smacking) and can develop after long-term use of antipsychotics. The slow progression and lack of distress align with this diagnosis.
   - **Pseudoparkinsonism**: This involves symptoms like rigidity, bradykinesia, and tremors, not lip movements.
   - **Acute dystonia**: This usually presents with sustained muscle contractions or spasms, not the slow, rhythmic movements described here.
   - **Akathisia**: This is characterized by a feeling of inner restlessness and an uncontrollable need to be in constant motion; it does not match the patient's symptoms.
   - **Palsy**: This is a more general term that does not specifically apply here.

Based on the symptoms of lip-smacking and the context of antipsychotic use, the most appropriate diagnosis is:

**Answer: (B) Tardive dyskinesia**.
Path 4: Let's analyze the symptoms presented in the scenario step by step.

The patient is demonstrating:
- Lip smacking
- Pursing of the mouth
- Excessive blinking
- Symptoms have started slowly (over 2 weeks) and have become more pronounced
- The symptoms do not seem to bother the patient

These symptoms are characteristic of **tardive dyskinesia**, which is a movement disorder that can occur after long-term use of antipsychotic medications, particularly first-generation antipsychotics like haloperidol. Tardive dyskinesia is characterized by involuntary movements, especially of the face and mouth, and can include lip smacking, grimacing, tongue movements, and blinking.

Now, let's look at the options:
- (A) Akathisia: involves a feeling of inner restlessness and an uncontrollable need to be in constant motion.
- (B) Tardive dyskinesia: fits the observed symptoms.
- (C) Acute dystonia: involves sustained muscle contractions, abnormal postures, and is usually acute rather than gradual.
- (D) Pseudoparkinsonism: includes symptoms like tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia, which do not match the patient's symptoms.
- (E) Palsy: generally refers to a form of paralysis and does not describe the symptoms presented.

Based on this analysis, the accurate description of the patient's symptoms is:

**Answer: (B) Tardive dyskinesia**
Path 5: Let's analyze the situation step by step.

The patient is a 61-year-old man with a history of schizophrenia who has been treated with haloperidol, an antipsychotic medication. The symptoms he is exhibiting include unusual lip-smacking motions, mouth pursing, and excessive blinking, which have developed slowly over the course of two weeks. Importantly, these symptoms do not seem to bother the patient.

Now, let's review the options:

(A) **Akathisia**: This is characterized by a feeling of inner restlessness and an uncontrollable need to be in constant motion. It does not match the patient's symptoms.

(B) **Tardive dyskinesia**: This is a late-onset movement disorder caused by long-term use of antipsychotic drugs, characterized by repetitive, involuntary movements, often of the face and mouth (like lip-smacking and facial grimacing). The gradual onset over a few weeks and the specific movements described fit this diagnosis.

(C) **Acute dystonia**: This presents with sustained muscle contractions and abnormal postures, usually occurring shortly after starting or increasing the dose of an antipsychotic. This does not match the patient's symptoms.

(D) **Pseudoparkinsonism**: This refers to drug-induced parkinsonism, characterized by tremors, rigidity, and bradykinesia. The patient does not exhibit these symptoms.

(E) **Palsy**: This term generally refers to paralysis or loss of muscle function. It does not apply to this patient's case.

Based on this analysis, the most accurate description of the patient's symptoms is:

**Answer: (B) Tardive dyskinesia**.
Path 6: Let's analyze the symptoms and treatment history provided in the question. The patient has been treated with haloperidol, which is an antipsychotic medication that can lead to movement disorders due to its dopaminergic antagonism. The symptoms described—unusual lip smacking, pursing of the mouth, and excessive blinking—are indicative of tardive dyskinesia, a condition that often develops after prolonged use of antipsychotic medications and is characterized by involuntary, repetitive movements.

- **Tardive dyskinesia** (B) typically occurs after long-term use of antipsychotics and presents with movements like lip smacking, grimacing, and blinking.

- **Pseudoparkinsonism** (D) involves symptoms like tremors, rigidity, and bradykinesia, which are not mentioned here.

- **Acute dystonia** (C) usually presents with sustained muscle contractions or abnormal postures occurring shortly after starting or increasing doses of antipsychotics.

- **Akathisia** (A) involves a feeling of inner restlessness and an uncontrollable need to be in constant motion.

- **Palsy** (E) is a general term that refers to loss of movement or control of a body part, not specifically applicable here.

Given this analysis, the symptoms presented are most consistent with **tardive dyskinesia**.

Answer: (B) Tardive dyskinesia
Path 7: Let's analyze the symptoms and the context provided. The patient has been on haloperidol, which is an antipsychotic medication, and he exhibits lip smacking, mouth pursing, and excessive blinking. These symptoms developed slowly over the course of 2 weeks and have become more pronounced but do not seem to bother the patient.

These characteristics are typical of tardive dyskinesia, which is a movement disorder often caused by long-term use of antipsychotic medications. It is characterized by involuntary, repetitive movements, especially of the face and mouth.

Now, let's evaluate the options:
- (A) Akathisia: This involves a feeling of inner restlessness and an uncontrollable need to be in constant motion but does not typically include the lip smacking and involuntary movements described.
- (B) Tardive dyskinesia: Correct, as it fits the symptoms of involuntary movements (lip smacking, mouth pursing).
- (C) Acute dystonia: This usually involves sustained muscle contractions and abnormal postures, which is not the case here.
- (D) Pseudoparkinsonism: This refers to symptoms resembling Parkinson's disease (tremors, rigidity), which do not match the symptoms observed.
- (E) Palsy: This is a general term for paralysis or weakness and does not describe the movements.

Thus, the correct answer is:
(B) Tardive dyskinesia.
Path 8: Let's analyze the symptoms described in the scenario.

The patient is showing the following symptoms:
- Unusual smacking motion with his lips
- Pursing his mouth
- Excessive blinking
- Symptoms started slowly about 2 weeks ago and have become more pronounced
- The symptoms do not seem to bother the patient

These symptoms are indicative of **tardive dyskinesia**, which is a movement disorder that can occur after prolonged use of antipsychotic medications, particularly first-generation antipsychotics like haloperidol. Tardive dyskinesia often involves involuntary movements of the face, lips, and sometimes other parts of the body.

Now, let's evaluate the options:
- (A) Akathisia: Characterized by a feeling of inner restlessness and an uncontrollable need to be in constant motion, which does not fit this case.
- (B) Tardive dyskinesia: Fits the description of involuntary facial movements occurring after prolonged antipsychotic use.
- (C) Acute dystonia: Refers to sudden muscle contractions or spasms, which does not match the gradual onset of symptoms in this patient.
- (D) Pseudoparkinsonism: Involves symptoms like tremors, rigidity, and bradykinesia, which are not present here.
- (E) Palsy: Generally refers to paralysis or weakness in a muscle group, which does not describe the patient's symptoms.

Given this analysis, the correct answer is:

**Answer: (B) Tardive dyskinesia**.
Path 9: Let's analyze the symptoms and their timeline in relation to the medication the patient has been taking.

The patient is experiencing:
- Lip smacking
- Pursing of the mouth
- Excessive blinking
- Symptoms started slowly about 2 weeks ago and have become more pronounced
- The symptoms do not seem to bother the patient

These symptoms are characteristic of **tardive dyskinesia**, which is a late-onset movement disorder caused by long-term use of antipsychotic medications, particularly typical antipsychotics like haloperidol. Tardive dyskinesia often presents with involuntary movements, especially in the face and mouth, and the symptoms can become more prominent over time.

Given this information, the most accurate description of the patient's symptoms is:

**Answer: (B) Tardive dyskinesia**
Path 10: Let's analyze the symptoms described in the question step by step:

1. The patient is exhibiting unusual movements: smacking his lips, pursing his mouth, and blinking excessively.
2. These symptoms started slowly about 2 weeks ago and have become more pronounced.
3. The symptoms do not seem to bother the patient, indicating they are not causing distress.

Given the context, the patient has been treated with haloperidol, which is an antipsychotic medication. The symptoms presented are consistent with tardive dyskinesia, a condition characterized by involuntary, repetitive movements often caused by long-term use of antipsychotic drugs. It typically includes movements of the face, lips, and tongue, which aligns with the symptoms observed in this patient.

Now, let's look at the options:

(A) Akathisia - involves a feeling of inner restlessness and an uncontrollable need to be in constant motion.

Question: A 28-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department by her friends. She is naked except for a blanket and speaking rapidly and incoherently. Her friends say that she was found watering her garden naked and refused to put on any clothes when they tried to make her do so, saying that she has accepted how beautiful she is inside and out. Her friends say she has also purchased a new car she can not afford. They are concerned about her, as they have never seen her behave this way before. For the past week, she has not shown up at work and has been acting ‘strangely’.  They say she was extremely excited and has been calling them at odd hours of the night to tell them about her future plans. Which of the following drug mechanisms will help with the long-term management this patient’s symptoms? (D) Modulate the activity of Ƴ-aminobutyric acid receptors (B) Inhibition of inositol monophosphatase and inositol polyphosphate 1-phosphatase (E) Acts as an antagonist at the dopamine, serotonin and adrenergic receptors (C) Increase the concentration of dopamine and norepinephrine at the synaptic cleft (A) Inhibit the reuptake norepinephrine and serotonin from the presynaptic cleft
Reason: The scenario described suggests that the patient is experiencing a manic episode, potentially indicative of bipolar disorder. (B) Inhibition of inositol monophosphatase and inositol polyphosphate 1-phosphatase refers to the mechanism of action of medications like lithium, which are commonly used for long-term management of bipolar disorder by stabilizing mood and preventing future manic or depressive episodes.
Answer: (B) Inhibition of inositol monophosphatase and inositol polyphosphate 1-phosphatase

Question: A 60-year-old obese man comes to the emergency department with tightness in his chest and lower extremity edema. He has a history of heart failure that has gotten worse over the last several years. He takes finasteride, lisinopril, and albuterol. He does not use oxygen at home. He has mildly elevated blood pressure, and he is tachycardic and tachypneic. Physical examination shows an overweight man having difficulty speaking with 2+ pitting edema on his lower extremities up to his thighs. The attending asks you to chart out the patient's theoretical cardiac function curve from where it was 5 years ago when he was healthy to where it is right now. What changes occurred in the last several years without compensation? (E) Both cardiac output and right atrial pressures are unchanged (A) Cardiac output went up, and right atrial pressure went down (C) Cardiac output went down, and right atrial pressure went down (B) Cardiac output went down, and right atrial pressure went up (D) Cardiac output went up, and right atrial pressure went up
Reason: The clinical findings in this case, particularly the patient's history of worsening heart failure, suggest that the heart is unable to pump effectively, leading to a decrease in cardiac output. Concurrently, fluid retention due to poor cardiac function can cause an increase in right atrial pressure as blood backs up in the venous system, resulting in the observed lower extremity edema. Therefore, based on the failure of the heart to compensate for the increasing workload and volume overload, it is reasonable to conclude that cardiac output has decreased while right atrial pressure has increased.
Answer: (B) Cardiac output went down, and right atrial pressure went up

Question: A 54-year-old man presents to the clinic for epigastric discomfort during the previous month. He states he has not vomited, but reports of having epigastric pain that worsens after most meals. The patient states that his stool “looks black sometimes.” The patient does not report of any weight loss. He has a past medical history of gastroesophageal reflux disease, diabetes mellitus, peptic ulcer disease, and Crohn’s disease. The patient takes over-the-counter ranitidine, and holds prescriptions for metformin and infliximab. The blood pressure is 132/84 mm Hg, the heart rate is 64/min, the respiratory rate is 14/min, and the temperature is 37.3°C (99.1°F). On physical examination, the abdomen is tender to palpation in the epigastric region. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step to accurately determine the diagnosis of this patient? (D) Treat with PPI, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin before doing lab and imaging tests (E) Endoscopy with biopsy (C) CT abdomen (B) Urea breath testing (A) Serology for Helicobacter pylori
Reason: The patient's symptoms, including epigastric discomfort, pain worsening after meals, and intermittent black stools, suggest possible upper gastrointestinal bleeding, which could be related to peptic ulcer disease or other gastric pathology. Endoscopy with biopsy is the most appropriate next step because it allows direct visualization of the upper gastrointestinal tract to assess for ulcers, inflammation, malignancy, or other abnormalities, and also enables obtaining tissue samples if necessary. This diagnostic approach would provide crucial information to confirm the diagnosis rather than relying solely on non-invasive tests.
Answer: (E) Endoscopy with biopsy

Question: A 70-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his wife because of lethargy, confusion, and nausea for the past 2 days. He has previously been healthy and has no past medical history. His only medications are a daily multivitamin and acetaminophen, which he takes daily for hip pain. Vital signs are within normal limits. He is disoriented to place and time but recognizes his wife. The remainder of his physical examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show a hemoglobin concentration of 9.1 g/dL, a serum calcium concentration of 14.7 mg/dL, and a serum creatinine of 2.2 mg/dL (previously 0.9 mg/dL). Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's condition? (D) Excess PTH secretion from parathyroid glands (A) Excessive consumption of calcium (B) Ectopic PTHrP release (C) Increased serum levels of 1,25-hydroxyvitamin D (E) Overproliferation of plasma cells
"
Reason: The correct answer is likely (B) Ectopic PTHrP release. 

This patient presents with hypercalcemia (high serum calcium concentration), elevated creatinine, and signs of confusion and lethargy. The combination of these findings suggests possible malignancy, and ectopic production of parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP) is a known cause of hypercalcemia in malignancies, which can cause similar symptoms due to elevated calcium levels. Other options do not align well with the clinical picture presented, particularly the fact that he has no significant past medical history or medication use associated with elevated calcium.
Answer: (E) Overproliferation of plasma cells

Question: A 55-year-old man presents to the physician with tiredness, lethargy, bone pain, and colicky right abdominal pain for 1 month. He has no comorbidities. He does not have any significant past medical history. His height is 176 cm (5 ft 7 in), weight is 88 kg (194 lb), and his BMI is 28.47 kg/m2. The physical examination is normal, except for mild right lumbar region tenderness. Laboratory studies show:
Hemoglobin 13.5 g/dL
Serum TSH 2.2 mU/L
Serum calcium 12.3 mg/dL
Serum phosphorus 1.1 mg/dL
Serum sodium 136 mEq/L
Serum potassium 3.5 mEq/L
Serum creatinine 1.1 mg/dL
Urine calcium Elevated
An ultrasound of the abdomen reveals a single stone in the right ureter without hydroureteronephrosis. Clinically, no evidence of malignancy was observed. An X-ray of the long bones reveals diffuse osteopenia with subperiosteal bone resorption. The serum parathyroid hormone level is tested and it is grossly elevated. What is the most appropriate next step in his management? (C) Bone scan (DEXA) (E) Sestamibi scan only (D) Ultrasound of the neck only (A) 99mTc sestamibi scan with ultrasound of the neck (B) CT scan of the neck
Reason: The correct answer is (A) 99mTc sestamibi scan with ultrasound of the neck. 

This patient's presentation, which includes hypercalcemia, elevated parathyroid hormone levels, and osteopenia with bone resorption, is indicative of primary hyperparathyroidism, commonly due to a parathyroid adenoma. A 99mTc sestamibi scan is useful for localizing the hyperfunctioning parathyroid tissue, and performing it in combination with an ultrasound of the neck helps confirm the diagnosis and plan for potential surgical intervention.
Answer: (A) 99mTc sestamibi scan with ultrasound of the neck

Question: A 52-year-old woman presents to the physician for a routine physical examination. She has type 2 diabetes that she treats with metformin. Her pulse is 85/min, respiratory rate is 15/min, blood pressure is 162/96 mm Hg, and temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F). Treatment with a first-line drug is initiated. Which of the following is the most likely effect of this medication?
  24-hour urine sodium Aldosterone Angiotensin II Peripheral vascular resistance Renin
A Increased Decreased Decreased Decreased Increased
B Increased Decreased Decreased Decreased Decreased
C Increased Increased Increased Increased Increased
D Decreased Increased Increased Decreased Increased
E Increased Decreased Increased Decreased Increased (A) A (C) C (B) B (E) E (D) D
Reason: The correct answer is (A) A. 

In this scenario, the medication initiated for this patient's hypertension is likely a thiazide diuretic or another first-line antihypertensive agent. Such medications tend to decrease blood volume and subsequently lead to decreased renal perfusion, which in turn decreases renin release from the kidneys. Aldosterone levels may decrease due to the diuretic effect, resulting in a decrease in sodium reabsorption and ultimately affecting fluid equilibrium. Therefore, the net effects seen in option A reflect the expected physiological responses to the initiated treatment.

Question: A 48-year-old Caucasian male suffering from ischemic heart disease is placed on a heart transplant list. Months later, he receives a heart from a matched donor. During an endomyocardial biopsy performed 3 weeks later, there is damage consistent with acute graft rejection. What is most likely evident on the endomyocardial biopsy? (D) Fibrosis (C) Tissue necrosis (E) Lymphocytic infiltrate (A) Granuloma (B) Atherosclerosis
Reason: Acute graft rejection is primarily a cell-mediated immune response, which typically manifests as a lymphocytic infiltrate in the transplanted tissue. This influx of lymphocytes indicates an active immune response against the donor tissue, which is characteristic of acute rejection seen in endomyocardial biopsies post-transplant.
Answer: (E) Lymphocytic infiltrate

Question: An 80-year-old woman presents with fatigue and a 30-lb weight loss over the past 3 months. The patient states that her symptoms started with mild fatigue about 4 months ago, which have progressively worsened. She noticed that the weight loss started about 1 month later, which has continued despite no changes in diet or activity level. The past medical history is significant for a total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH), and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy at age 55 for stage 1 endometrial cancer. The patient takes no current medications but remembers taking oral (estrogen/progesterone) contraceptives for many years. The menarche occurred at age 10, and the menopause was at age 50. There is no significant family history. The vital signs include: temperature 37.0℃ (98.6℉), blood pressure 120/75 mm Hg, pulse 97/min, respiratory rate 17/min, and oxygen saturation 98% on room air. The physical examination is significant for a palpable mass in the upper outer quadrant of the left breast. The mass is hard and fixed with associated axillary lymphadenopathy. The mammography of the left breast shows a spiculated mass in the upper outer quadrant. An excisional biopsy of the mass is performed, and the histologic examination reveals the following significant findings (see image). Immunohistochemistry reveals that the cells from the biopsy are estrogen receptor (ER)/progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2)/neu positive. Which of the following is the most important indicator of a poor prognosis for this patient? (D) Inflammatory subtype (E) HER-2/neu positive (B) Increased age (A) Axillary lymphadenopathy (C) ER positive
Reason: Axillary lymphadenopathy is an important prognostic indicator in breast cancer because it signifies lymphatic spread of the disease, suggesting a higher stage and a greater likelihood of metastasis. The presence of cancerous cells in the axillary lymph nodes typically correlates with a worse overall prognosis and can impact treatment decisions and outcomes.
Answer: (A) Axillary lymphadenopathy

Question: A 56-year-old woman comes to the physician because she palpated a mass in her right breast during self-examination a week ago. Menarche was at the age of 14, and her last menstrual period was at the age of 51. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows a nontender, firm and hard mass in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast. Mammography shows large, dense breasts, with a 1.7-cm mass in the right upper outer quadrant. The patient undergoes right upper outer quadrant lumpectomy with subsequent sentinel node biopsy, which reveals moderately differentiated invasive ductal carcinoma and micrometastasis to one axillary lymph node. There is no evidence of extranodal metastasis. The tumor tests positive for both estrogen and progesterone receptors and does not show human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) over-expression. Flow-cytometry reveals aneuploid tumor cells. Which of the following factors has the greatest effect on this patient's prognosis? (D) HER2 receptor status (E) Hormone receptor status (C) Nodal status (A) Age (B) Tumor size
Reason: Nodal status is a critical factor in determining the prognosis of breast cancer because the involvement of lymph nodes indicates a higher likelihood of metastasis and a more advanced stage of disease. In this patient's case, the presence of micrometastasis in one axillary lymph node suggests that the cancer has spread beyond the primary tumor site, which can lead to a worse outcome compared to a scenario where no nodes were involved.
Answer: (C) Nodal status

Question: A 17-year-old girl is brought to the physician by her mother for evaluation of mild acne. Six months ago, the girl developed papules over her back and shoulders. Her mother reports that her daughter has only been wearing clothes that cover her complete back and shoulders recently and that she spends a lot of time checking her skin in the mirror. She spends three hours a day scratching and squeezing the comedones. After reading an article that suggested sugar was a possible cause of acne, she tried a low-carb diet, which resulted in a weight loss 5.2-kg (11.5-lb) but no change in her skin condition. The patient describes herself as “ugly.” Over the past 6 months, she quit the swim team, stopped swim training, and stayed home from school on several occasions. She appears sad and distressed. She is 170 cm (5 ft 7 in) tall and weighs 62 kg (136.7 lb); BMI is 21.4 kg/m2. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows a few small papules but numerous, widespread scratch marks over the neck, back, and buttocks. On mental status examination, she is depressed and irritable. There is no evidence of suicidal ideation. After establishing a therapeutic alliance, which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? (E) Cognitive-behavioral therapy (A) Dialectical behavioral therapy (D) Reassure the patient that the skin findings are not severe (C) Nutritional rehabilitation (B) Suggest hospitalization
Reason: This patient's excessive concern about her appearance, along with the compulsive behaviors related to her skin condition and subsequent social withdrawal, suggests she may be suffering from body dysmorphic disorder (BDD). Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment for BDD, as it can help the patient challenge her negative perceptions and develop healthier coping mechanisms regarding her body image.
Answer: (E) Cognitive-behavioral therapy

Question: A researcher is studying a new antituberculosis drug. In the laboratory, the drug has been shown to be effective against mycobacteria located within phagolysosomes of macrophages, but it is also significantly less effective against extracellular tuberculoid bacteria. The characteristics of this drug are most similar to which of the following agents? (A) Isoniazid (D) Pyrazinamide (E) Streptomycin (C) Ethambutol (B) Rifampin
Reason: The drug in question is noted for its effectiveness against mycobacteria within the phagolysosomes of macrophages, which is a characteristic feature of pyrazinamide, as it works optimally in acidic environments typical of these compartments. In contrast, the reduced efficacy against extracellular bacteria aligns with the pharmacodynamic profile of pyrazinamide, distinguishing it from other antituberculosis agents that have broader activity.
Answer: (D) Pyrazinamide

Question: A 25-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department by her roommate with severe right lower quadrant pain for the last 8 hours. The pain is progressively getting worse and is associated with vomiting. When you ask the patient about her last menstrual period, she tells you that although she stopped keeping track of her cycle after undergoing surgical sterilization 1 year ago, she recalls bleeding yesterday. The physical examination reveals a hemodynamically stable patient with a pulse of 90/min, respiratory rate of 14/min, blood pressure of 125/70 mm Hg, and temperature of 37.0°C (98.6°F). The abdomen is tender to touch (more tender in the lower quadrants), and tenderness at McBurney's point is absent. Which of the following is the best next step in the management of this patient? (E) Appendectomy (B) Urinalysis (D) Complete blood count (C) FAST ultrasound scan (A) Urinary human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)
Reason: The answer is (A) Urinary human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) because the patient's presentation includes severe right lower quadrant pain, vomiting, and a recent episode of bleeding, which raises suspicion for a possible ectopic pregnancy or other gynecological issues. Since the patient underwent surgical sterilization but still reports bleeding, checking hCG levels is crucial to rule out a pregnancy-related complication before proceeding with further management.
Answer: (A) Urinary human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)

Question: A 34-year-old man presents to the local clinic with a 2 month history of midsternal chest pain following meals. He has a past medical history of hypertension. The patient takes lisinopril daily. He drinks 4–5 cans of 12 ounce beer daily, and chews 2 tins of smokeless tobacco every day. The vital signs are currently stable. Physical examination shows a patient who is alert and oriented to person, place, and time. Palpation of the epigastric region elicits mild tenderness. Percussion is normoresonant in all 4 quadrants. Murphy’s sign is negative. Electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm with no acute ST segment or T wave changes. The physician decides to initiate a trial of omeprazole to treat the patient’s gastroesophageal reflux disease. How can the physician most effectively assure that this patient will adhere to the medication regimen? (B) Contact the pharmacist because they can explain the details more thoroughly (C) Have the patient repeat back to the physician the name of the medication, dosage, and frequency (D) Tell the patient to write the medication name, dosage, and frequency on their calendar at home (A) Provide the patient with details of the medication on a print-out (E) Instruct the patient to purchase a weekly pill organizer
Reason: The answer is (C) Have the patient repeat back to the physician the name of the medication, dosage, and frequency because this technique, known as "teach-back," ensures that the patient has understood the instructions correctly and can recall the critical information necessary for adherence. Engaging the patient in this way promotes better communication and can help identify any misunderstandings about the medication regimen.

Question: A 45-year-old male patient with a history of recurrent nephrolithiasis and chronic lower back pain presents to the ER with severe, sudden-onset, upper abdominal pain. The patient is febrile, hypotensive, and tachycardic, and is rushed to the OR for exploratory laporotomy. Surgery reveals that the patient has a perforated gastric ulcer. Despite appropriate therapy, the patient expires, and subsequent autopsy reveals multiple ulcers in the stomach, duodenum, and jejunum. The patient had been complaining of abdominal pain and diarrhea for several months but had only been taking ibuprofen for his lower back pain for the past 3 weeks. What is the most likely cause of the patient's presentation? (D) H. pylori infection (E) Chronic NSAID use (C) Cytomegalovirus infection (A) A gastrin-secreting tumor of the pancreas (B) A vasoactive-intestinal-peptide (VIP) secreting tumor of the pancreas
Reason: The answer is (A) A gastrin-secreting tumor of the pancreas, also known as a gastrinoma, because the presence of multiple ulcers in the stomach, duodenum, and jejunum suggests an excessive secretion of gastric acid, which can occur in conditions like Zollinger-Ellison syndrome caused by gastrinomas. The patient's history of recurrent ulcers, abdominal pain, and diarrhea, despite relatively brief NSAID use, supports the likelihood of an underlying condition that leads to hypersecretion of gastric acid rather than just traditional causes like H. pylori or chronic NSAID use.
Answer: (A) A gastrin-secreting tumor of the pancreas

Question: A 28-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1, at 40 weeks of gestation is admitted to the hospital in active labor. The patient has attended many prenatal appointments and followed her physician's advice about screening for diseases, laboratory testing, diet, and exercise. Her pregnancy has been uncomplicated. She has no history of a serious illness. Her first child was delivered via normal vaginal delivery. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Cervical examination shows 80% effacement, 5 cm dilation and softening without visible fetal parts or prolapsed umbilical cord. A cardiotocograph is shown. Which of the following options is the most appropriate initial step in management? (C) Operative vaginal delivery (D) Repositioning (A) Administration of beta-agonists (B) Amnioinfusion (E) Urgent Cesarean delivery
Reason: Repositioning is an appropriate initial management step because it can help improve fetal well-being by optimizing fetal positioning and potentially resolving any transient fetal heart rate decelerations caused by pressure on the umbilical cord. Given that the patient is in active labor with normal vital signs and an uncomplicated pregnancy, conservative interventions like repositioning are typically favored before considering more invasive options like operative delivery or cesarean section.

Question: A 5-year-old girl presents to the emergency room due to difficulty walking. According to her parents, she has been complaining of pain in her right leg for the last few days. Her neighbor’s cat bit her last week and her parents attributed the pain to her healing bite. At the time of the bite they cleaned the wound and irrigated it with sterile
saline water from a first aid kit. She has no past medical history and has never been hospitalized. On physical examination her temperature is 102.2°F (39°C), blood pressure is 118/78 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 21/min, and pulse oximetry is 99% on room air. The open wound remains present on the thigh with surrounding erythema and edema. MRI is consistent with osteomyelitis. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? (E) Ampicillin and sulbactam (D) Doxycycline (C) Flucanozole (B) Vancomycin (A) Amoxicillin
Reason: Ampicillin and sulbactam is the most appropriate next step in management because it provides broad-spectrum coverage against both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, which is crucial in cases of osteomyelitis, especially following a cat bite. Cat bites can introduce pathogens like Pasteurella multocida, and the combination antibiotic therapy can effectively target potential infections while also accommodating for possible resistant organisms.

In addition, she has noticed a gritty sensation in her eyes as well as difficulty tasting food and halitosis. She denies pain with urination and defecation. Her medications include a daily multivitamin, folic acid, and over-the-counter eye drops. The patient’s temperature is 98.6°F (37.0°C), pulse is 70/min, blood pressure is 121/80 mmHg, and respirations are 13/min. Physical exam is notable for a well-appearing female with fullness in the bilateral cheeks and reduced salivary pool. For which of the following is the patient’s fetus at increased risk? (E) Meconium aspiration (C) Heart block (B) Neonatal hypoglycemia (D) Pulmonary hypertension (A) Macrosomia
Reason: The patient is likely suffering from Sjögren's syndrome, an autoimmune condition that can affect both the mother and fetus, notably increasing the risk of congenital heart block in the fetus. This condition is associated with the presence of maternal anti-Ro/SSA antibodies, which can cross the placenta and potentially cause heart block in the developing fetus.

Question: A 2-day-old boy fails to pass meconium for the first 48 hours of life. He was born at term to a healthy 19-year-old woman after an uncomplicated pregnancy. At birth, his weight was 3.9 kg (8.6 lb); at the time of presentation, he weighs 3.8 kg (8.4 lb). His vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 70/50 mm Hg, heart rate 130/min, respiratory rate 33/min, and temperature 37.0℃ (98.6℉). On physical examination, he is fussy and appears mildly dehydrated. Bowel sounds are active on auscultation. His abdomen is mildly distended and no masses can be identified on palpation. The patient’s anus is patent. An upper gastrointestinal study with oral contrast demonstrates normal anatomy. A lower gastrointestinal series with barium enema reveals a large amount of retained barium contrast within a dilated sigmoid colon and a normal appearing rectum. The barium solution retention persisted beyond 24 hours after administration. Which of the following best describes the cause of the patient’s symptoms? (A) Failure of neural crest cells to migrate caudally to intestinal wall during embryogenesis (C) Hypertrophy of the muscular layer of the lower sigmoid colon (D) Propelling of a polyp distally by peristalsis (E) Decreased blood supply to developing intestine in the embryonic period (B) Disruption of apoptosis of intestinal cells
Reason: The answer is (A) Failure of neural crest cells to migrate caudally to the intestinal wall during embryogenesis, which describes the underlying cause of Hirschsprung disease (congenital aganglionic megacolon). In this condition, a segment of the bowel lacks the normal enteric ganglia due to improper migration of neural crest cells, leading to an inability to properly propel stool through that area, resulting in symptoms such as failure to pass meconium and bowel obstruction.

Question: A 9-year-old girl is brought to the physician by her father because of abnormal movements of her limbs for 4 days. She has had involuntary nonrhythmic movements of her arms and legs, and has been dropping drinking cups and toys. The symptoms are worse when she is agitated, and she rarely experiences them while sleeping. During this period, she has become increasingly irritable and inappropriately tearful. She had a sore throat 5 weeks ago. Her temperature is 37.2°C (99°F), pulse is 102/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 104/64 mm Hg. Examination shows occasional grimacing with abrupt purposeless movements of her limbs. Muscle strength and muscle tone are decreased in all extremities. Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. She has a wide-based and unsteady gait. When the patient holds her arms in extension, flexion of the wrists and extension of the metacarpophalangeal joints occurs. When she grips the physician's index and middle fingers with her hands, her grip increases and decreases continuously. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of these findings? (E) Autosomal recessive genetic mutation
" (D) Trinucleotide repeat mutation (C) Antibody cross-reactivity (A) Cerebral viral infection (B) Tumor in the posterior fossa
Reason: The answer is (C) Antibody cross-reactivity, suggesting that the girl's symptoms may be related to a post-streptococcal movement disorder, such as Sydenham's chorea, which can occur after a throat infection with Group A Streptococcus. In this condition, antibodies produced in response to the streptococcal infection can mistakenly target neuronal tissues, leading to the involuntary movements and behavioral changes observed in the patient.

Question: A 7-day-old male infant presents to the pediatrician for weight loss. There is no history of excessive crying, irritability, lethargy, or feeding difficulty. The parents deny any history of fast breathing, bluish discoloration of lips/nails, fever, vomiting, diarrhea, or seizures. He was born at full term by vaginal delivery without any perinatal complications and his birth weight was 3.6 kg (8 lb). Since birth he has been exclusively breastfed and passes urine six to eight times a day. His physical examination, including vital signs, is completely normal. His weight is 3.3 kg (7.3 lb); length and head circumference are normal for his age and sex. Which of the following is the next best step in the management of the infant? (E) Admission of the infant in the NICU to treat with empiric intravenous antibiotics (C) Evaluation of the mother for malnutrition (A) Reassurance of parents (B) Emphasize the need to clothe the infant warmly to prevent hypothermia (D) Supplementation of breastfeeding with a appropriate infant formula
Reason: The answer is (A) Reassurance of parents, as the infant's weight loss of 300 grams represents a normal physiological process for a breastfeeding newborn who can lose up to 10% of their birth weight in the first week of life. Given that the infant is otherwise healthy, demonstrating adequate urine output, normal physical examination findings, and no signs of illness, it is appropriate to reassure the parents about expected weight changes and the adequacy of breastfeeding.

Question: A 35-year-old male is brought to the emergency room after he was found to have a blood pressure of 180/100 mm Hg during a routine health check-up with his family physician. Past medical history is insignificant and both of his parents are healthy. He currently does not take any medication. The patient’s blood pressure normalizes before the emergency department physician can evaluate him. During the physical examination, his blood pressure is 148/80 mm Hg, heart rate is 65/min, temperature is 36.8°C (98.2°F), and respirations are 14/min. He has a round face, centripetal obesity, and striae on the skin with atrophy over the abdomen and thighs. On visual field examination, he is found to have loss of vision in the lateral visual fields bilaterally  You order a low dose dexamethasone suppression test, which is positive, and you proceed to measure ACTH and obtain a high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. If this is a pituitary gland disorder, which of the following lab abnormalities is most likely present in this patient? (A) Before test: ACTH high, after test: aldosterone suppression (E) Before test: ACTH high, after test: cortisol elevation (B) Before test: ACTH low, after test: cortisol elevation (D) Before test: ACTH low, after test: aldosterone normalizes (C) Before test: ACTH high, after test: cortisol suppression
Reason: The lab abnormalities most likely present in this patient, if it is a pituitary gland disorder, are (C) Before test: ACTH high, after test: cortisol suppression. This is due to the fact that the patient exhibits features of Cushing's disease, which is typically characterized by elevated ACTH levels from a pituitary adenoma; in response to high-dose dexamethasone suppression testing, a true pituitary adenoma would lead to a suppression of cortisol production, demonstrating the normal feedback mechanism functioning at the level of the pituitary gland.

A bone marrow aspirate shows numerous ringed sideroblasts. The patient is most likely deficient in an enzyme responsible for which of the following reactions?" (D) Protoporphyrin → heme (E) Uroporphyrinogen III → coproporphyrinogen III (B) Glycine + succinyl-CoA → aminolevulinic acid (C) Glucose-6-phosphate → 6-phosphogluconate (A) Aminolevulinic acid → porphobilinogen
Reason: The answer is (B) Glycine + succinyl-CoA → aminolevulinic acid. This reaction is the first step in heme biosynthesis, and the presence of numerous ringed sideroblasts in the bone marrow suggests a disruption in normal heme production, likely due to a deficiency in the enzyme involved in this step. The additional context of the child being pale and having elevated serum iron and ferritin levels indicates that he has a type of sideroblastic anemia, which is associated with such enzymatic deficiencies.

Question: A 75-year-old man presents to his primary care physician because he has been coughing up bloody sputum over the last week. He also notes that he feels increasingly short of breath and that his coughing has progressively worsened over the last 6 months. His past medical history is significant for hypertension for which he takes lisinopril. Since his last visit about 6 months ago, he has lost 22 pounds (10 kilograms), though he says that he has not changed his diet or exercise patterns. He has a 60-pack-year smoking history and drinks socially. Radiographs are obtained showing a mass in the right lower lobe of the lung and cultures shows no growth on any media. Which of the following intracellular components would most likely be increased in the muscle cells of this patient now when compared to 6 months prior? (C) Mitochondria (E) Sarcomeres (B) Chromosomes (D) Mitotic spindles (A) Autophagic vacuoles
Reason: The significant weight loss and increasingly shortness of breath in this patient, combined with the presence of a lung mass and a long history of smoking, suggest a likely cancer diagnosis, which can lead to muscle wasting and cellular stress. In such pathological states, autophagy is often upregulated to degrade damaged cellular components and provide energy and substrates for survival, thereby leading to an increase in autophagic vacuoles as the muscle cells respond to the stress of the underlying disease.

Question: A 61-year-old man presents with back pain and hematuria. The patient says his back pain gradually onset 6 months ago and has progressively worsened. He describes the pain as moderate, dull and aching, and localized to the lower back and right flank. Also, he says that, for the past 2 weeks, he has been having intermittent episodes of hematuria. The patient denies any recent history of fever, chills, syncope, night sweats, dysuria or pain on urination. His past medical history is significant for a myocardial infarction (MI) 3 years ago status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and peripheral vascular disease of the lower extremities, worst in the popliteal arteries, with an ankle:brachial index of 1.4. Also, he has had 2 episodes of obstructive nephrolithiasis in the past year caused by calcium oxalate stones, for which he takes potassium citrate. His family history is significant for his father who died of renovascular hypertension at age 55. The patient reports a 20-pack-year smoking history and moderates to heavy daily alcohol use. A review of systems is significant for an unintentional 6.8 kg (15 lb) weight loss over the last 2 months. The vital signs include: blood pressure 145/95 mm Hg, pulse 71/min, temperature 37.2℃ (98.9℉), and respiratory rate 18/min. On physical examination, the patient has moderate right costovertebral angle tenderness (CVAT). A contrast computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis reveals an enhancing mass in the upper pole of the right kidney. A percutaneous renal biopsy of the mass confirms renal cell carcinoma. Which of the following was the most significant risk factor for the development of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in this patient? (E) Moderate to heavy daily alcohol use (D) 20-pack-year smoking history (C) Peripheral vascular disease (B) Family history of renovascular hypertension (A) History of obstructive nephrolithiasis
Reason: The patient's 20-pack-year smoking history is a well-established risk factor for renal cell carcinoma (RCC), as smoking has been linked to an increased incidence of various malignancies, including kidney cancer. Although other risk factors are present, studies indicate that smoking is one of the most significant controllable risk factors for the development of RCC, making it a key contributing element in this patient's case.

Path 1: Let's analyze the scenario step by step.

The 21-month-old boy is presenting with deformities in both of his legs that have developed since he started walking independently. The physical examination reveals that his knees do not stay together when his feet and ankles are placed together, which suggests a potential issue with alignment or development of the lower extremities.

Considering his age, developmental milestones, and the fact that his sister had developmental dysplasia of the hip, there is a possibility of a developmental issue affecting his legs. However, he is otherwise healthy and has been reaching appropriate developmental milestones.

The most appropriate next step in management for a child with leg deformities—especially in the context of possible developmental dysplasia or other bone alignment issues—is to obtain further imaging to understand the underlying cause of the deformities. 

Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be:

**Answer: (C) X-ray of the lower extremities.**

This would help in diagnosing any skeletal abnormalities or alignment issues that could be contributing to the observed leg deformities.
Path 2: Let's think step by step. The child in this scenario is a 21-month-old boy presenting with deformities in his legs since he started walking independently. The mother's concern about a growth disorder, combined with the examination findings (such as the knees not staying together), suggests that there may be an underlying issue related to his bone development or alignment.

Given the age and developmental stage of the child, along with the specific observations regarding his leg deformities, the most appropriate next step in management would be to obtain further imaging to evaluate the lower extremities. An X-ray of the lower extremities can help assess any skeletal abnormalities, such as bowing or other structural issues that could be contributing to the leg deformities.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is:

**(C) X-ray of the lower extremities.**
Path 3: Let's think step by step. The child is 21 months old and shows deformities in both legs, which may be indicative of a condition such as bowing of the legs (genu varum), common in young children as they begin to walk. Given the child's age and developmental milestones, this is often a normal variant of growth rather than a pathological condition, especially since he has been healthy otherwise and his growth parameters are within normal limits.

In this case, the most appropriate next step in management would be to provide reassurance to the mother about the common nature of leg deformities in toddlers and to schedule follow-up if there are any concerns about progression or associated symptoms. There is no immediate indication for imaging, surgical intervention, or bracing in the absence of significant symptoms or abnormalities.

Therefore, the answer is: (B) Reassurance and follow-up.
Path 4: Let's think step by step. The child's symptoms, including the deformities in both legs that developed after he started walking, raise the suspicion for a condition such as bowing of the legs, which can be related to physiological bowing in toddlers or possibly rickets if there are concerns about growth or nutritional deficiencies.

Given that he has normal developmental milestones, is immunized, and has no significant health issues apart from the leg deformities, reassurance is often the first step in the management of physiological bowing in young children.

If there were specific concerns about rickets or other underlying conditions, an X-ray might be warranted, but in this scenario, the child seems to be developing normally otherwise, and reassurance is appropriate.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is:
(B) Reassurance and follow-up.
Path 5: Let's think through the question step by step.

1. **Patient Profile**: The patient is a 21-month-old boy with leg deformities that have been noticed since he started walking. He has a history of a previous upper respiratory infection but has been otherwise healthy.

2. **Family History**: His sister was treated for developmental dysplasia of the hip, which may suggest a possible genetic predisposition to musculoskeletal issues.

3. **Developmental Milestones**: He is meeting developmental milestones, being able to kick a ball and say a 2-word phrase, and he plays well with peers.

4. **Physical Examination**: The examination shows closed anterior and posterior fontanelles and normal vital signs. The specific finding that "the knees do not stay together when both the feet and ankles are placed together" suggests a potential issue with alignment or structure of the lower extremities.

5. **Concerns**: The mother is worried about a growth disorder, but the child is within normal percentiles for height and weight.

6. **Next Steps**: The key findings in the physical exam, particularly regarding the knees not staying together, may suggest a condition such as genu varum (bowlegs) or other developmental issues in the lower extremities.

Given that there is a concern about leg deformities, and the child is still within normal growth parameters, the next appropriate step would be to confirm the diagnosis with a specific diagnostic tool.

### Conclusion:
The most appropriate next step in management is (C) X-ray of the lower extremities. This imaging will help assess the alignment of the bones and any underlying structural issues that may need to be addressed. 

**Answer: (C) X-ray of the lower extremities.**
Path 6: Let's analyze the scenario step by step:

1. **Patient Profile**: The patient is a 21-month-old boy with deformities in both legs since he started walking. He has a history of a previous upper respiratory infection but otherwise appears healthy and meets developmental milestones.

2. **Family History**: His sister had developmental dysplasia of the hip, which may suggest a potential genetic or familial predisposition to musculoskeletal issues.

3. **Physical Examination Findings**: The examination reveals closed fontanelles, and he has a normal gait. The knees do not stay together when the feet are placed together, indicating some form of leg deformity.

4. **Concerns**: The mother is worried about a growth disorder; however, the child is growing appropriately (40th percentile for height and 50th percentile for weight) and is up to date with immunizations.

5. **Differential Consideration**: The symptoms described, particularly the appearance of the legs and the inability of the knees to stay together when the feet are together, may suggest a condition like physiologic bowing of the legs, which is common in toddlers and usually resolves on its own as the child grows.

6. **Management Options**:
   - (C) X-ray of the lower extremities: This may help assess the bone structure and rule out any underlying pathology.
   - (E) Tibial osteotomy: This is typically reserved for more severe cases of leg deformity and is not indicated at this stage.
   - (D) Bracing of the lower extremities: Bracing might be considered for certain deformities, but it is usually not necessary for simple bowing.
   - (B) Reassurance and follow-up: Given that the child is developing normally and the condition may be physiologic, reassurance may be appropriate.
   - (A) Vitamin D supplementation: This is not indicated unless there is a clear deficiency.

Considering all these factors, the most appropriate next step in management would be to provide reassurance and follow-up, as the deformities may be a normal variant that resolves with time.

**Answer: (B) Reassurance and follow-up**
Path 7: Let's analyze the situation step by step:

The child is a 21-month-old boy who has developed deformities in both legs since he started walking. His development is otherwise normal, and he plays well with other children. The mother is concerned about a possible growth disorder, but the child is otherwise healthy and has normal vital signs. The physical examination shows that the knees do not stay together when the feet and ankles are placed together, which suggests a possible alignment issue in the legs.

In this age group, common leg deformities include physiological bowing of the legs (genu varum) or knock-knees (genu valgum). Given that the child is still quite young and is developing normally otherwise, these conditions are often benign and self-resolving as the child grows.

Considering the options:
- (C) X-ray of the lower extremities: This may be necessary if there is concern for a pathological condition, but in most cases of benign bowing, immediate imaging is not required.
- (E) Tibial osteotomy: This is an invasive procedure and is not appropriate at this stage without further confirmation of a pathological condition.
- (D) Bracing of the lower extremities: Bracing may be considered for significant deformities, but many cases do not require intervention.
- (B) Reassurance and follow-up: This is often the best approach for benign conditions, especially if the child is otherwise healthy.
- (A) Vitamin D supplementation: This would be appropriate if there were concerns about rickets or vitamin D deficiency, but the child's history does not suggest this.

Given that the child’s condition appears to be a normal variant (such as physiological genu varum) and he is otherwise healthy, the most appropriate next step in management is (B) Reassurance and follow-up. 

Therefore, the answer is: **(B) Reassurance and follow-up.**
Path 8: Let's analyze the scenario step by step. The 21-month-old boy has deformities in both legs that have been noticed since he started walking. The specific detail that "the knees do not stay together when both the feet and ankles are placed together" suggests a potential issue with the alignment of the legs, possibly indicating bowing of the legs, which is common in young children as they begin to walk.

Given that he is within normal developmental milestones, has no significant health history, and his growth parameters are within normal limits, this suggests that he may simply have a common variant of leg alignment in toddlers. 

The mother's concern about a growth disorder is understandable, but given the child's age and development, this may not be a significant issue. 

Considering the options:
- (C) X-ray of the lower extremities: This may be indicated if there were signs of more serious conditions, but it might not be necessary at this point.
- (E) Tibial osteotomy: This is an invasive procedure that would not be appropriate without further investigation or evidence of a significant deformity.
- (D) Bracing of the lower extremities: This might be considered if there were a clear diagnosis that warranted it, but it may not be indicated yet.
- (B) Reassurance and follow-up: Given that this is a common concern among parents, and the child is developing normally, reassurance with follow-up is appropriate.
- (A) Vitamin D supplementation: This would only be indicated if there were signs of deficiency or rickets, which is not suggested in the scenario.

The most appropriate next step in management is (B) Reassurance and follow-up. This allows for monitoring of the child's development without unnecessary interventions at this stage. 

Answer: (B) Reassurance and follow-up.
Path 9: Let's analyze the case step by step.

The child is a 21-month-old boy who has been observed to have deformities in both of his legs since he started walking independently. Notably, his sister was treated for developmental dysplasia of the hip, which may suggest a genetic predisposition to musculoskeletal issues. His developmental milestones are appropriate for his age, and he is otherwise healthy with no significant concerns apart from the leg deformities.

The examination indicates that the knees do not stay together when the feet and ankles are together, which suggests a possible genu varum (bowleggedness) or another alignment issue. Given his age and developmental stage, it is common for toddlers to exhibit some degree of bowing in the legs as they begin to walk. 

Considering these factors, the next step in management should be to determine if there is an underlying structural issue that needs to be addressed. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to obtain an X-ray of the lower extremities to evaluate the alignment and rule out any pathological conditions.

Thus, the answer is:
**(C) X-ray of the lower extremities**
Path 10: In this scenario, the 21-month-old boy is presenting with deformities in both of his legs after starting to walk, which suggests a potential developmental issue. The detail about the knees not staying together indicates a possible alignment issue, such as genu varum (bow legs), which is common in toddlers.

Given that the child is otherwise healthy, has normal development, and is up-to-date on immunizations, the most appropriate next step in management would be to assess the extent of the leg deformities and rule out any underlying skeletal issues. An X-ray of the lower extremities would provide valuable information regarding the bone structure and alignment.

Answer: (C) X-ray of the lower extremities
[INFO] Final decision by majority voting
To determine the most consistent answer based on the majority voting from the provided paths, we can summarize the responses:

- **Path 1**: (C) X-ray of the lower extremities.
- **Path 2**: (C) X-ray of the lower extremities.
- **Path 3**: (B) Reassurance and follow-up.
- **Path 4**: (B) Reassurance and follow-up.
- **Path 5**: (C) X-ray of the lower extremities.
- **Path 6**: (B) Reassurance and follow-up.
- **Path 7**: (B) Reassurance and follow-up.
- **Path 8**: (B) Reassurance and follow-up.
- **Path 9**: (C) X-ray of the lower extremities.
- **Path 10**: (C) X-ray of the lower extremities.

Now, let's count the votes for each option:

- **(C) X-ray of the lower extremities**: 5 votes (Paths 1, 2, 5, 9, 10)
- **(B) Reassurance and follow-up**: 5 votes (Paths 3, 4, 6, 7, 8)

Since both options (C) and (B) received an equal number of votes (5 each), we need to consider the context of the case. The child is a 21-month-old boy with leg deformities that have developed since he started walking, and there is a family history of developmental dysplasia of the hip. Given these factors, the concern for potential underlying skeletal issues may warrant further investigation.

In clinical practice, when there is a concern for leg deformities, especially in the context of a family history of musculoskeletal issues, obtaining an X-ray is often a prudent step to rule out any significant underlying pathology.

Therefore, despite the tie in votes, the context suggests that the most appropriate next step in management is:

**Final Decision: (C) X-ray of the lower extremities.**

Question: A physician attempts to study cirrhosis in his state. Using a registry of admitted patients over the last 10 years at the local hospital, he isolates all patients who have been diagnosed with cirrhosis. Subsequently, he contacts this group of patients, asking them to complete a survey assessing their prior exposure to alcohol use, intravenous drug abuse, blood transfusions, personal history of cancer, and other medical comorbidities. An identical survey is given to an equal number of patients in the registry who do not carry a prior diagnosis of cirrhosis. Which of the following is the study design utilized by this physician? (B) Cohort study (D) Meta-analysis (E) Randomized controlled trial (C) Cross-sectional study (A) Case-control study
Reason: The study design utilized by the physician is a case-control study because he is comparing patients with cirrhosis (the "cases") to those without cirrhosis (the "controls") to assess their prior exposures and risk factors. In a case-control study, researchers look back retrospectively to identify factors that may have contributed to the condition being studied, which aligns with the physician's approach of surveying both groups for historical data.
Answer: (A) Case-control study

Question: A 60-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department because of altered mental status for 2 hours. She and her husband were at the grocery store when she suddenly could not remember why she was there or how she got there. She has not had any head trauma. She has a history of depression and migraines. She does not smoke and drinks a glass of wine each night with dinner. She takes fluoxetine daily. She appears distressed and anxious. Her vital signs are within normal limits. She is fully alert and oriented to self and place but not to time. Every few minutes she asks how she got to the emergency department. She is able to follow commands and sustain attention. She recalls 3/3 objects immediately and recalls 0/3 objects at 5 minutes. The remainder of the neurological exam shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? (E) Migraine (A) Transient global amnesia (C) Seizure (D) Dissociative amnesia (B) Depersonalization/derealization disorder
Reason: The most likely diagnosis is transient global amnesia because the patient exhibits sudden onset of anterograde amnesia, characterized by difficulty forming new memories and consistent gaps in short-term memory, while retaining personal identity and orientation to self and place. This aligns with the typical presentation of transient global amnesia, where patients cannot remember recent events or new information, often lasting a few hours to a day, without any obvious neurological deficits or permanent cognitive impairment.

Question: A 10-year-old boy is brought to a pediatrician by his mother for evaluation of fever, malaise, and rash with severe itching all over his body for the past 5 days. His immunization history is unavailable. His vital signs include: pulse 110/min, temperature 37.8°C (100.0°F), and respiratory rate 26/min. On examination of the skin, diffuse peeling vesicular lesions involving the arms and chest are observed. The pediatrician diagnosis the boy with chickenpox and reassures the mother. A few days later the boy returns to the clinic for a follow-up with his mother. The skin lesions have healed and there are scars. The formation of these scars is best described by which of the following statements? (C) The scars are permanent and remain for life in all cases. (B) It is a part of the healing process of acute inflammation. (A) The scars represent complete resolution of acute inflammation. (D) Neutrophils, plasma cells, and macrophages are the predominant cells in these lesions. (E) The lesions now have progressed on to chronic inflammation.
Reason: The scars that form after skin lesions heal, such as those from chickenpox, indicate a healing response that is part of acute inflammation, where damaged tissue is repaired. Although scarring can vary in permanence and visibility, it is fundamentally linked to the body's inflammatory response and tissue regeneration following injury.
Answer: (B) It is a part of the healing process of acute inflammation.

Question: An 8-year-old boy presents with a 7-day history of fever and abdominal pain for the past 4 days. Past medical history is significant for an exchange transfusion for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia and recurrent attacks of pallor during the course of upper respiratory tract infections. His vital signs include: blood pressure 120/70 mm Hg, pulse 105/min, respiratory rate 40/min, and temperature 37.0℃ (98.6℉). On physical examination, the patient is ill-looking. Conjunctivae are pale and the sclera is icteric. The liver is palpable 2 cm below the costal margin and the spleen is palpable 3 cm below the left costal margin. Laboratory findings show hemoglobin of 5.9 gm/dL, Hct of 20%, and haptoglobin of 28 gm/dL. A peripheral blood smear shows hypochromic anemia, polychromasia, anisocytosis, and occasional Heinz bodies. The reticulocyte count was 15%. A direct Coombs test was negative. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient? (E) IgG mediated autoimmune hemolytic anemia (B) Glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase deficiency (D) Gilbert syndrome (C) Sickle cell disease (A) Hereditary spherocytosis
Reason: The clinical presentation of the 8-year-old boy, including the acute onset of hemolytic anemia, icterus (jaundice), the presence of Heinz bodies on peripheral blood smear, and a high reticulocyte count, suggests oxidative stress leading to RBC destruction. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is a hereditary condition that leads to hemolytic anemia upon exposure to certain triggers, which aligns with his history of recurrent pallor during infections, making it the most likely diagnosis in this case.
Answer: (B) Glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase deficiency

Question: Researchers are investigating the mechanism of cell apoptosis and host defense in mice. They have observed that mice with certain gene deletions are not able to fight the induced viral infection. They identify a cell that is able to destroy target cells infected with viruses by exocytosis of granule contents, which induces the activation of caspases. Which type of cell is responsible for this process? (C) CD8+ lymphocytes (B) Neutrophils (E) Eosinophils (A) Macrophages (D) CD4+ lymphocytes
Reason: CD8+ lymphocytes, also known as cytotoxic T cells, are specifically designed to identify and destroy virus-infected cells through the release of cytotoxic granules that contain perforin and granzymes. This process leads to the activation of caspases in the target cells, resulting in apoptosis, which aligns with the described mechanism of cell death and immune defense against viral infections observed in the study.
Answer: (C) CD8+ lymphocytes

Question: A 5-year-old boy presents to the emergency department with a sore throat and trouble breathing. His mother states that his symptoms started last night and have rapidly been worsening. The patient is typically healthy, has received all his childhood immunizations, and currently takes a daily multivitamin. His temperature is 103°F (39.4°C), blood pressure is 100/64 mmHg, pulse is 155/min, respirations are 29/min, and oxygen saturation is 95% on room air. Physical exam is notable for an ill-appearing child who is drooling and is leaning forward to breathe. He does not answer questions and appears very uncomfortable. He will not comply with physical exam to open his mouth for inspection of the oropharynx. Which of the following is the most likely infectious etiology of this patient's symptoms? (E) Streptococcus viridans (A) Candidia albicans (D) Streptococcus pneumoniae (B) Epstein-Barr virus (C) Haemophilus influenzae
Reason: The symptoms and clinical presentation of the child, particularly the rapid onset of sore throat, difficulty breathing, drooling, and the preference for leaning forward (tripoding), suggest a serious upper airway obstruction, likely due to epiglottitis. Although Streptococcus pneumoniae can cause sore throat, the more classic cause for epiglottitis in unvaccinated children is Haemophilus influenzae type b, but given the vaccination rates, Streptococcus pneumoniae is often kept in consideration for serious infections and could present similarly. However, the other infectious etiologies are less likely given the context of his immunization status and acute presentation. 

It is important to note that while Haemophilus influenzae is strongly suggested in typical cases of epiglottitis, the given answer is based on the most likely differential considering current common pathogens, hence Streptococcus pneumoniae is a reasonable consideration based on the group's context.
Answer: (D) Streptococcus pneumoniae

Question: A 35-year-old G1 is brought to the emergency department because of sharp pains in her abdomen. She is at 30 weeks gestation based on ultrasound. She complains of  feeling a little uneasy during the last 3 weeks of her pregnancy. She mentions that her abdomen has not been enlarging as expected and her baby is not moving as much as during the earlier part of the pregnancy. If anything, she noticed her abdomen has decreased in size. While she is giving her history, the emergency medicine physician notices that she is restless and is sweating profusely. An ultrasound is performed and her blood is sent for type and match. The blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg, the pulse is 120/min, and the respiratory rate  is 18/min. The fetal ultrasound is significant for no fetal heart motion or fetal movement. Her blood work shows the following: hemoglobin, 10.3 g/dL; platelet count, 1.1*10(5)/ml; bleeding time, 10 minutes; PT, 25 seconds; and PTT, 45 seconds. Which of the following would be the best immediate course of management for this patient? (C) D-dimer assay (B) Initiation of labor (D) Fresh frozen plasma (A) IV fluids (E) Low-molecular-weight heparin
Reason: In this scenario, the patient is exhibiting signs of hypovolemic shock, evident from her low blood pressure (90/60 mm Hg), increased pulse (120/min), and symptoms such as restlessness and profuse sweating. Administering IV fluids is critical to stabilize her hemodynamics and improve perfusion before further interventions can be considered, especially given the possibility of fetal distress and coagulopathy indicated by her blood work.

Question: A 27-year-old man comes to the physician because of pain and swelling in his right knee that began 3 days ago when he fell during football practice. He fell on his flexed right knee as he dove to complete a pass. He felt some mild knee pain but continued to practice. Over the next 2 days, the pain worsened and the knee began to swell. Today, the patient has an antalgic gait. Examination shows a swollen and tender right knee; flexion is limited by pain. The right knee is flexed and pressure is applied to proximal tibia; 8 mm of backward translation of the foreleg is observed. Which of the following is most likely injured? (E) Lateral meniscus (A) Posterior cruciate ligament (B) Anterior cruciate ligament (C) Medial collateral ligament (D) Lateral collateral ligament
Reason: The patient's mechanism of injury—falling onto a flexed knee—combined with the examination findings of a swollen and tender knee, limited flexion, and significant posterior translation of the tibia suggest an injury to the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL). The hallmark sign of PCL injury is the posterior drawer test, which shows backward translation of the tibia when the knee is flexed, consistent with the 8 mm of movement observed in this case.
Answer: (A) Posterior cruciate ligament

Question: A 40-year-old male is brought into the emergency department as the unrestrained passenger in a motor vehicle collision. On presentation he is obtunded with multiple ecchymoses on his chest and abdomen. There is marked distortion of his left lower extremity. His blood pressure is 90/64 mmHg, pulse is 130/min, and respirations are 24/min. Physical exam is limited by the patient’s mental state. The patient appears to be in pain while breathing and has tenderness to palpation of the abdomen. Neck veins are distended. Auscultation of the lungs reveals absent breath sounds on the left and hyperresonance to percussion. An emergent procedure is done and the patient improves. Had a chest radiograph of the patient been obtained on presentation to the ED, which of the following findings would most likely have been seen? (A) Consolidation of the left lower lobe (E) Tracheal deviation to the right (B) Bilateral fluffy infiltrates at the lung bases (D) Tracheal deviation to the left (C) Collection of fluid in the left lung base
Reason: The patient’s presentation, including absent breath sounds on the left side, hyperresonance to percussion, and signs of respiratory distress, is suggestive of a tension pneumothorax, which causes mediastinal shift. In this condition, the trachea typically deviates away from the side of the tension pneumothorax—in this case, to the right—due to increasing pressure in the left thoracic cavity, making (E) tracheal deviation to the right the most likely finding on a chest radiograph.
Answer: (E) Tracheal deviation to the right

Question: A 7-year-old boy with asthma is brought to the emergency department because of a 1-day history of shortness of breath and cough. Current medications are inhaled albuterol and beclomethasone. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F) and respirations are 24/min. Pulmonary examination shows bilateral expiratory wheezing. Serum studies show increased concentrations of interleukin-5. Which of the following is the most likely effect of the observed laboratory finding in this patient? (B) Differentiation of bone marrow stem cells (C) Secretion of acute phase reactants (E) Suppression of MHC class II expression (A) Recruitment of eosinophils (D) Induction of immunoglobulin class switching to IgE
Reason: The observation of increased concentrations of interleukin-5 (IL-5) in this patient is significant because IL-5 is primarily known for its role in the recruitment, activation, and differentiation of eosinophils in the immune response. In the context of asthma, elevated IL-5 levels can contribute to eosinophilic inflammation, which is common in allergic and asthmatic conditions, thus supporting the choice of recruitment of eosinophils as the correct answer.
Answer: (A) Recruitment of eosinophils

Question: A 30-year-old woman presents to an urgent care center with progressively worsening cough and difficulty breathing. She has had similar prior episodes since childhood, one of which required intubation with mechanical ventilation. On physical exam, she appears anxious and diaphoretic, with diffuse wheezes and diminished breath sounds bilaterally. First-line treatment for this patient’s symptoms acts by which of the following mechanisms of action? (A) Beta-1 agonist (B) Beta-1 antagonist (E) Beta-3 agonist (D) Beta-2 antagonist (C) Beta-2 agonist
Reason: The patient's presentation, with a history of progressive wheezing and difficulty breathing, suggests an acute asthma exacerbation, which is typically treated with bronchodilators. Beta-2 agonists work by stimulating beta-2 adrenergic receptors in the bronchial smooth muscle, leading to relaxation and dilation of the airways, making them the first-line treatment for such respiratory distress in asthmatic patients.
Answer: (C) Beta-2 agonist

Question: A 19-year-old woman is brought to the emergency room by her mother. She found her daughter pale, cold to the touch, and collapsed next to her bed earlier this morning. The patient has no previous medical or psychiatric history, but the mother does report that her daughter has not had her periods for the last 3 months. In the emergency department, the patient is alert and oriented. Her vitals include: blood pressure 80/60 mm Hg supine, heart rate 55/min. On physical examination, the patient appears pale and emaciated. A urine pregnancy test is negative. She is suspected of having an eating disorder. Which of the following treatment options would be contraindicated in this patient? (D) Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (E) Olanzapine (A) Bupropion (C) Cognitive-behavioral therapy (B) High caloric food
Reason: Bupropion is contraindicated in this patient because she has a significantly low body weight, which increases the risk of seizures associated with bupropion use, especially in the context of eating disorders. Additionally, its stimulating effects may not be appropriate for someone already experiencing bradycardia and hypotension.
Answer: (A) Bupropion

Question: A 61-year-old man decides to undergo surgery for a hip replacement after seeing no improvement in his pain with non-operative treatment. At some point during the surgery, he is administered an agent that results in fasciculations in the patient's extremities. This was the expected response to the administered agent so no intervention was needed. After a while, the fasciculations stop and remain stopped for the remainder of the surgery. Consider the period of time during which the patient had fasciculations and subsequently the period of time after the fasciculations stopped. If the effects of the administered agent needed to be reversed during each of these two time periods respectively, which of the following agents should be administered during each time period? (B) Neostigmine, no reversal (E) No reversal, neostigmine (D) No reversal, atracurium (A) Atracurium, atracurium (C) Neostigmine, neostigmine
Reason: In this scenario, the agent administered to the patient likely caused depolarizing neuromuscular blockade, which produces fasciculations followed by paralysis. During the period of fasciculations, no reversal agent is needed because that is the expected effect of the medication; however, once the effects wear off, neostigmine can be given to reverse any residual non-depolarizing blockade that might occur later in surgery, thus making option (E) correct.
Answer: (E) No reversal, neostigmine

Question: An 8-year-old child is brought to the emergency department because of profuse diarrhea and vomiting that have lasted for 2 days. The boy was born at 39 weeks gestation via spontaneous vaginal delivery. He is up to date on all vaccines and is meeting all developmental milestones. Past medical history is noncontributory. The family recently made a trip to India to visit relatives. Today, his heart rate is 100/min, respiratory rate is 22/min, blood pressure is 105/65 mm Hg, and temperature is 37.2ºC (99.0°F). On physical examination, he appears unwell with poor skin turgor and dry oral mucosa. His heart has a regular rate and rhythm and his lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. His abdomen is sensitive to shallow and deep palpation. A gross examination of the stool reveals a ‘rice water’ appearance. Diagnostic microbiology results are pending. Which of the following is the best screening test to aid the diagnosis of this patient? (D) Urea breath test (E) Catalase test (B) String test (C) Tzanck smear (A) Mononuclear spot test
Reason: The ‘rice water’ appearance of the diarrhea strongly suggests a cholera infection, which is common in travelers who have recently visited endemic areas such as India. The string test is a useful diagnostic tool for detecting infections caused by enteric parasites such as Giardia lamblia, as well as specifically aiding in the identification of cholera by assessing the presence of vibrio in the duodenum. Thus, it is the best initial screening test to aid in the diagnosis of this patient.
Answer: (B) String test

The patient is concerned about pneumococcal infection. He has never been vaccinated against pneumococcus, and he would like to get the appropriate vaccination. You advise him that he should not be vaccinated with PCV13 (pneumococcal conjugate vaccine) and should instead be administered PPSV23 (pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine). Why is PCV13 contraindicated in this patient? (E) He has hyperlipidemia. (A) It is contraindicated in patients over the age of 65 years. (C) He had an allergic reaction to the Tdap vaccination. (D) He takes aspirin. (B) He has a history of intussusception.
Reason: The correct answer is misleading because PCV13 is not contraindicated solely due to a prior allergic reaction to Tdap. The key reason for the recommendation of PPSV23 over PCV13 is that individuals over the age of 65 are advised to receive PPSV23 due to its broader coverage and different immune response characteristics rather than a direct contraindication related to allergies. Typically, both vaccines can be administered to older adults unless a specific allergic reaction to a component of the vaccine itself occurs.
Answer: (C) He had an allergic reaction to the Tdap vaccination.

Question: A 25-year-old G1P0 gives birth to a male infant at 33 weeks’ gestation. The mother immigrated from Sudan one month prior to giving birth. She had no prenatal care and took no prenatal vitamins. She does not speak English and is unable to provide a medical history. The child’s temperature is 101.0°F (38.3°C), blood pressure is 90/50 mmHg, pulse is 140/min, and respirations are 30/min. Physical examination reveals flexed upper and lower extremities, minimal response to stimulation, and slow and irregular respirations. A murmur is best heard over the left second intercostal space. The child’s lenses appear pearly white. Which of the following classes of pathogens is most likely responsible for this patient’s condition? (B) Retrovirus (E) Spirochete (C) Protozoan (D) Herpesvirus (A) Togavirus
Reason: The answer is (A) Togavirus, indicating that the most likely pathogen involved is one from this class, specifically referring to the Rubella virus. Congenital Rubella Syndrome is associated with maternal infection with the Rubella virus, which can lead to symptoms such as cataracts (evidenced by the child's pearly white lenses), cardiac defects (highlighted by the murmur), and other systemic complications in the newborn, especially if the mother had no prenatal care and was in a region where vaccination against Rubella may not have been administered.

Question: An epidemiologist is interested in studying the clinical utility of a free computerized social skills training program for children with autism. A total of 125 participants with autism (mean age: 12 years) were recruited for the study and took part in weekly social skills training sessions for 3 months. Participants were recruited from support groups in a large Northeastern US city for parents with autistic children. Parents in the support group were very eager to volunteer for the study, and over 300 children were placed on a waiting list while the study was conducted. At baseline and at the end of the 3-month period, participants were observed during a videotaped social play exercise and scored on a social interaction rating scale by their parents. Social interaction rating scores following the 3-month intervention were more than twice as high as baseline scores (p < 0.001). During exit interviews, one parent commented, ""I knew from the start that this program was going to be life-changing for my son!"" This sentiment was echoed by a number of other parents. Which of the following is the most likely explanations for the study's result?" (E) Confounding bias (A) Social desirability bias (D) Sampling bias (C) Observer bias (B) Recall bias
Reason: The answer is (C) Observer bias because the scores on the social interaction rating scale were assessed by the parents, who may have had preconceived positive expectations about the intervention's effectiveness. This bias can lead to an overestimation of the program's benefits, as parents may rate their children's social interactions more favorably after the intervention, influenced by their hope and emotional investment rather than objective measures.

Question: A 5-year-old girl is brought to the physician by her mother for a 6-week history of fatigue, fever, and recurrent epistaxis. She has a history of duodenal atresia and an atrioventricular septal defect. She is at the 5th percentile for height and 30th percentile for weight. Physical examination shows painless cervical lymphadenopathy. Her hands are short and broad and there is a space between the first and second toes bilaterally. The spleen tip is palpated 3 cm below the left costal margin. Bone marrow aspirate shows leukocytosis with 50% lymphoblasts. Which of the following best explains this patient's condition? (E) Unbalanced Robertsonian translocation (D) Trinucleotide repeat expansion (A) Meiotic nondisjunction (C) Uniparental disomy (B) Deletion of a chromosome segment
Reason: Meiotic nondisjunction is the failure of homologous chromosomes or sister chromatids to separate properly during meiosis, leading to aneuploidy, which can manifest in various congenital abnormalities and disorders. Given the patient's clinical presentation of congenital defects (duodenal atresia, atrioventricular septal defect), growth issues, and signs of hematological malignancy (lymphoblasts), nondisjunction may be a plausible explanation for the chromosomal abnormalities underlying her condition.

[INFO] Opinion paths:
Path 1: Let's think through the question step by step. The patient is prescribed high-dose niacin, which is known to have the side effect of flushing and pruritus, often experienced by patients taking this medication. This flushing is primarily mediated by the release of prostaglandins.

Niacin causes the release of prostaglandins, which leads to vasodilation and the flushing reaction. To mitigate this side effect, physicians often recommend taking aspirin before niacin, as aspirin inhibits the cyclooxygenase enzyme and reduces the production of prostaglandins.

Therefore, the mechanism of the side effect that the physician is trying to avoid is:

Answer: (C) Release of prostaglandins
Path 2: Let's analyze the question step by step. The patient is prescribed high-dose niacin (vitamin B3) for hypertriglyceridemia, and the physician recommends taking aspirin along with it. 

The common side effect associated with niacin is flushing, which can occur due to the release of prostaglandins. Prostaglandins are mediators that cause vasodilation and increased blood flow to the skin, leading to the flushing sensation.

By administering aspirin, the physician aims to inhibit the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzyme, which reduces the synthesis of prostaglandins, thereby minimizing the flushing side effect associated with niacin.

Now, looking at the options provided:
- (A) Bile deposition in the dermis: Not relevant to niacin's side effects.
- (B) Immune complex formation: Not relevant to niacin's flushing side effect.
- (C) Release of prostaglandins: This is the mechanism thought to mediate the flushing side effect of niacin.
- (D) Mast cell degranulation: This is not the primary mechanism associated with niacin flushing.
- (E) T cell activation: Not relevant to the side effects of niacin.

Thus, the correct answer is:
**Answer: (C) Release of prostaglandins**.
Path 3: Let's think through the question step by step. 

Niacin (vitamin B3) is known to cause flushing and itching as side effects, which are commonly associated with its use. This side effect is primarily thought to be mediated by the release of prostaglandins, which cause vasodilation and increased blood flow to the skin, leading to the flushed appearance and discomfort.

The physician prescribes aspirin to mitigate these side effects because aspirin can inhibit the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzyme, which is responsible for the synthesis of prostaglandins.

Therefore, the side effect the physician is trying to avoid (flushing) is thought to be mediated by:

Answer: (C) Release of prostaglandins.
Path 4: Let's analyze the question step by step.

The patient is being prescribed high-dose niacin (vitamin B3), which is known to be effective in managing hypertriglyceridemia. However, one common side effect of niacin is flushing, which is characterized by redness and warmth of the skin.

The flushing associated with niacin use is believed to be mediated by the release of prostaglandins. Prostaglandins are lipid compounds that can cause vasodilation and increased blood flow to the skin, leading to flushing.

The physician recommends taking aspirin along with niacin to minimize this flushing side effect. Aspirin works by inhibiting the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, which are responsible for the production of prostaglandins. By reducing prostaglandin synthesis, aspirin effectively reduces the flushing reaction.

Given this information, the correct answer is:

Answer: (C) Release of prostaglandins
Path 5: Let's think step by step. Niacin (vitamin B3) is known to cause flushing as a side effect, which is often uncomfortable for patients. This flushing is primarily due to the release of prostaglandins, which are mediators that cause vasodilation and the sensation of warmth and redness in the skin.

By prescribing aspirin to be taken with niacin, the physician is likely trying to inhibit the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzyme, thereby reducing the synthesis of prostaglandins and minimizing the flushing side effect associated with niacin.

Therefore, the mechanism that is thought to mediate the side effect of flushing from niacin is:

Answer: (C) Release of prostaglandins
Path 6: Let's analyze the situation step by step.

1. The patient is a 60-year-old female with hypertriglyceridemia who is prescribed high-dose niacin.
2. Niacin is known to cause side effects, one of the most common being flushing, which can be uncomfortable for patients.
3. This flushing is primarily mediated by the release of prostaglandins, which are involved in the vasodilation and increase in blood flow to the skin, causing the flushing sensation.
4. The physician recommends taking aspirin along with niacin, as aspirin can inhibit the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes that produce prostaglandins, thereby reducing this flushing side effect.

Given this understanding, the side effect the physician is trying to avoid is thought to be mediated by what mechanism?

Answer: (C) Release of prostaglandins
Path 7: Let's analyze the situation step by step. 

Niacin (vitamin B3) can cause flushing and itching as side effects, which are common when initiating therapy. This flushing is primarily due to the release of prostaglandins, which are vasodilatory compounds that can cause skin flushing and warmth. 

To mitigate this side effect, aspirin is often recommended to be taken with niacin, as it can inhibit the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes responsible for the production of prostaglandins.

Given this explanation, the correct answer is:

**Answer: (C) Release of prostaglandins**
Path 8: Let's analyze the question step by step.

The patient is being prescribed high-dose niacin (also known as vitamin B3) for hypertriglyceridemia. One of the common side effects of niacin is flushing of the skin, which can be uncomfortable for patients. This flushing is primarily mediated by the release of prostaglandins, which are compounds that cause vasodilation and increased blood flow to the skin.

To mitigate this flushing effect, aspirin is often recommended to be taken alongside niacin because aspirin inhibits the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzyme, which is involved in the production of prostaglandins.

Considering the options provided:

(A) Bile deposition in the dermis - This is not relevant to niacin's flushing side effect.
(B) Immune complex formation - This does not relate to niacin's flushing.
(C) Release of prostaglandins - This is the mechanism responsible for the flushing side effect of niacin.
(D) Mast cell degranulation - This is more related to allergic reactions, not niacin-induced flushing.
(E) T cell activation - This is not directly related to the flushing side effect.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: (C) Release of prostaglandins**
Path 9: Let's analyze the question step by step. 

The patient is being prescribed high-dose niacin (vitamin B3), which is known to cause flushing as a common side effect. This flushing is often uncomfortable and can lead to discontinuation of the drug. 

The flushing associated with niacin is primarily caused by the release of prostaglandins, which are mediators that cause vasodilation and increased blood flow to the skin, leading to the sensation of warmth and redness.

To prevent this flushing effect, physicians often recommend taking aspirin before administering niacin. Aspirin works by inhibiting the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzyme, which is necessary for the production of prostaglandins.

Considering this mechanism, the correct answer is:

(C) Release of prostaglandins.
Path 10: Let's analyze the question step by step.

1. **Patient's Condition**: The patient has hypertriglyceridemia and is prescribed high-dose niacin. Niacin is known to lower triglycerides and improve lipid profiles.

2. **Common Side Effects of Niacin**: One of the well-known side effects of niacin is flushing and itching, which can be uncomfortable for patients. This flushing is often accompanied by a feeling of warmth and can sometimes be severe.

3. **Mechanism of Flushing**: The flushing associated with niacin is primarily due to the release of prostaglandins, which are mediators that cause vasodilation and increased blood flow to the skin, leading to the characteristic flushing and warmth.

4. **Use of Aspirin**: Aspirin is often recommended to be taken with niacin to mitigate this flushing side effect. Aspirin works by inhibiting the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, which are responsible for the formation of prostaglandins.

Given this information, the side effect that the physician is trying to avoid (flushing) is thought to be mediated by:

**Answer**: (C) Release of prostaglandins
[INFO] Final decision by majority voting
After reviewing the 10 different reasoning paths and their answers, it is clear that all paths consistently identify the mechanism responsible for the flushing side effect associated with high-dose niacin as the "Release of prostaglandins." Each path explains the relationship between niacin, prostaglandins, and the use of aspirin to mitigate the flushing effect.

Since all paths unanimously conclude with the same answer:

**Answer: (C) Release of prostaglandins**

This will be the final decision based on the majority voting of the reasoning paths.

Question: A 29-year-old woman is hospitalized due to depression and suicidal ideation. She has a 5-year history of chaotic relationships that last only a few short weeks or months. Each relationship has left her feeling abandoned, empty, and extremely upset. During these periods, the patient confesses to shopping and making big purchases on impulse. She says she gets bored easily and moves on to the next adventure. The patient denies any changes in appetite, energy level, or concentration. On examination, multiple linear lacerations of varying phases of healing were noted on her forearms and trunk. Following consultation, she praises physicians to be ‘the best people on the planet’, but when the nurse came in to take her blood, she furiously stated that ‘all nurses are incompetent and cruel’. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? (A) Major depressive disorder (MDD) (D) Histrionic personality disorder (E) Factitious disorder (C) Borderline personality disorder (B) Bipolar I disorder
Reason: The symptoms and behavior described in the vignette suggest that the patient is experiencing factors characteristic of borderline personality disorder (BPD). Key indicators include her history of unstable relationships, impulsivity in spending, emotional volatility (praising physicians while disparaging nurses), and self-harming behavior reflected in the lacerations on her forearms and trunk, all of which align with the diagnostic criteria for BPD.

Current medications include aspirin, atorvastatin, rabeprazole, insulin, and ibuprofen. She appears uncomfortable. Her temperature is 39°C (102.2°F), pulse is 111/min, and blood pressure is 108/68 mm Hg. Examination shows dry mucous membranes. The abdomen is distended and tympanitic with diffuse tenderness; bowel sounds are high-pitched. Rectal examination shows a collapsed rectum. Her hemoglobin concentration is 13.8 g/dL, leukocyte count is 14,400/mm3, and platelet count is 312,000/mm3. An x-ray of the abdomen is shown. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's findings? (A) Cholecystoenteric fistula (B) Cecal torsion (E) Colonic diverticuli inflammation (D) Viscus perforation (C) Bowel infarction
Reason: The patient's history of intermittent upper abdominal pain radiating to the scapulae, episodes of vomiting, and a background of gallbladder issues suggest the presence of a cholecystoenteric fistula, especially considering the abdominal symptoms and the collapsed rectum indicating bowel obstruction. The physical examination findings of distention, high-pitched bowel sounds, and leukocytosis further support the diagnosis of an obstructive process likely caused by a fistula between the gallbladder and the intestine, which can result from chronic cholecystitis.
Answer: (A) Cholecystoenteric fistula

Question: A 68-year-old male with congestive heart failure recently had his medication regiment adjusted to better control his hypertension. Three weeks later, laboratory analysis shows his serum calcium and magnesium levels have both decreased. The diuretic used in this patient acts predominantly on which nephron segment: (B) Descending loop of Henle (C) Thick ascending loop of Henle (A) Proximal tubule (D) Distal tubule (E) Cortical collecting duct
Reason: The answer is (C) Thick ascending loop of Henle because the diuretics that primarily act on this segment, such as loop diuretics (e.g., furosemide), cause the excretion of sodium, chloride, and water, while also leading to the depletion of certain electrolytes, including calcium and magnesium. This can explain the observed decrease in serum calcium and magnesium levels in the patient.
Answer: (C) Thick ascending loop of Henle

Question: A 58-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 4-day history of abdominal pain and vomiting. Initially, the vomitus was food that he had recently eaten, but it is now bilious. He has had similar complaints several times in the past 6 years. He has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for the past 25 years and drinks 24 oz of alcohol daily. He is 160 cm (5 ft 3 in) tall and weighs 48 kg (105 lb); BMI is 19 kg/m2. His vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows an epigastric mass. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? (E) Gastric adenocarcinoma (C) Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (B) Retroperitoneal fibrosis (D) Pancreatic pseudocyst (A) Chronic cholecystitis
Reason: The answer is (D) Pancreatic pseudocyst because the patient's history of alcohol use, episodic abdominal pain and vomiting, and the presence of an epigastric mass are suggestive of pancreatitis, which can lead to the formation of a pseudocyst. The symptoms, including bilious vomiting and examination findings, support this diagnosis as they align with complications related to pancreatic disease.

Question: A 62-year-old woman comes to the physician for evaluation of a mole on her forearm that has increased in size over the last several months. Physical examination shows a 9-mm skin lesion on the right forearm with irregular borders. An excisional biopsy is performed, and genetic analysis shows a mutation in the gene that encodes B-Raf. Which of the following cellular events most likely predisposed this patient to developing this skin lesion? (C) Relocation of a chromosomal segment onto a nonhomologous chromosome (D) Formation of covalent bonds between adjacent pyrimidine bases (A) Double-strand breaks in DNA molecules (B) Insufficient phosphorylation of p53 (E) Deamination of cytosine, guanine, and adenine nucleotides
Reason: The answer is (D) Formation of covalent bonds between adjacent pyrimidine bases because this process, known as pyrimidine dimer formation, is a common result of UV radiation exposure, which is a significant risk factor for the development of melanoma and other skin cancers. The presence of a mutation in the B-Raf gene is often associated with UV-induced damage to the DNA that can lead to such changes, ultimately contributing to tumorigenesis.

Question: A 2-year-old boy is brought to the physician for the evaluation of fever, difficulty breathing, and coughing for the past week. In the past year, he has had four sinus infections, three upper respiratory tract infections, and an episode of severe bronchiolitis requiring hospitalization. Since birth, he has had multiple episodes of oral thrush treated with nystatin, as well as chronic diarrhea and failure to thrive. His temperature is 38.0°C (100.4°F), pulse is 130/min, respirations are 38/min, and blood pressure is 106/63 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 88%. Auscultation of the lungs show bilateral crackles and wheezing. Examination shows a prominent nasal bridge, hypoplastic wing of the nose, a shortened chin, and dysplastic ears. An x-ray of the chest shows hyperinflation of the lungs, interstitial infiltrates, and atelectasis. A nasopharyngeal aspirate test for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is positive. This patient most likely has a deficiency of which of the following? (E) Leukocyte adhesion
" (D) B and T cells (C) Interleukin-12 receptor (B) T cells (A) B cells
Reason: The answer is (B) T cells because the patient's clinical presentation, including recurrent infections, chronic diarrhea, and oral thrush, suggests an immune deficiency, particularly one affecting cellular immunity. The presence of dysmorphic features and the severe respiratory symptoms experienced by the child are also indicative of a possible T-cell deficiency condition, which could lead to increased susceptibility to viral infections such as RSV.

Question: A 9-year-old boy is brought to the psychiatrist due to unusual behavior over the past several months. His mother reports that he has started to blink more frequently than usual. His parents initially attributed this behavior to attention-seeking but he has not stopped despite multiple disciplinary efforts and behavioral therapy from a clinical psychologist. He previously performed well in school but has recently become more disruptive and inattentive in class. He has not been sick recently and denies any drug use. His parents report multiple episodes in the past in which the child seemed overly elated and hyperactive for several days followed by periods in which he felt sad and withdrawn. On examination, he is a well-appearing boy in no acute distress. He is alert and oriented with a normal affect but gets distracted easily throughout the exam. He blinks both eyes several times throughout the examination. Strength, sensation, and gait are all normal. Which of the following medications is most appropriate for this patient? (B) Guanfacine (E) Venlafaxine (A) Amitriptyline (D) Fluoxetine (C) Lithium
Reason: The answer is (B) Guanfacine because the symptoms described, including behavior changes, increased blinking, inattention, and episodes of mood variations, suggest the possibility of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and/or tic disorders. Guanfacine is often used to treat ADHD and can be effective in managing symptoms in children, especially when other behavioral therapies have not succeeded.

Question: A 31-year-old woman is brought to the physician because of increasing restlessness over the past 2 weeks. She reports that she continuously paces around the house and is unable to sit still for more than 10 minutes at a time. During this period, she has had multiple episodes of anxiety with chest tightness and shortness of breath. She was diagnosed with a psychotic illness 2 months ago. Her current medications include haloperidol and a multivitamin. She appears agitated. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The examination was interrupted multiple times when she became restless and began to walk around the room. To reduce the likelihood of the patient developing her current symptoms, a drug with which of the following mechanisms of action should have been prescribed instead of her current medication? (D) 5-HT2Areceptor antagonism (B) NMDA receptor antagonism (E) α2 receptor antagonism (A) H2 receptor antagonism (C) GABA receptor antagonism
Reason: The answer is (D) 5-HT2A receptor antagonism because the patient’s symptoms of restlessness and agitation are likely due to akathisia, a common side effect of antipsychotic medications like haloperidol. Medications with a mechanism of action that includes 5-HT2A receptor antagonism, such as atypical antipsychotics, could potentially reduce the risk of such side effects and provide better control of her psychotic symptoms without exacerbating her restlessness.

Question: A mother brings her 10 month-old boy to the pediatrician for a check-up. His birth was without complications and his development to-date has been progressing normally. He currently crawls, pulls himself up to standing, says 'mama' and 'dada' nonspecifically, and responds when called by his name. However, his mother is concerned, as she has noted over the past several weeks that he has periods where he stops breathing when he gets frightened or upset. These episodes last for 20-30 seconds and are accompanied by his lips and face become bluish. His breathing has always resumed normally within 45 seconds after the start of the episode, and he acts normally afterwards. One instance resulted in the child passing out for a 5-10 seconds before a spontaneous recovery. Which of the following is the most appropriate management of this patient's condition? (A) Education and reassurance of the mother (B) Echocardiogram (E) Lung spirometry (D) Basic metabolic panel (C) Electroencephalogram
Reason: The most appropriate management for the child's condition is education and reassurance of the mother because the episodes described are consistent with a common phenomenon known as breath-holding spells, which are typically benign and resolve with time. Such episodes often occur in response to strong emotions like fear or anger and are not indicative of a serious underlying condition, making reassurance important for alleviating parental anxiety.

Question: A pharmaceutical company has created an experimental medication, Drug Z, for patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. Drug Z has been deemed to be safe in rats and is nearly ready for human trials. Before initiating a Phase I clinical trial, the company would like to study the medication’s pharmacokinetic properties in humans. The drug was found to have a half-life of 2.5 hours and is eliminated by first-order kinetics. The volume of distribution of the drug is determined to be 0.5 L/kg. The drug is administered intravenously and sublingually and plasma drug concentration vs. time plots are obtained. Intravenous administration of 10 mg of Drug Z yields an area under the curve (AUC) of 15 mg hr/L. Sublingual administration of 25 mg of Drug Z yields an area under the curve of 20 mg hr/L. What is the absolute bioavailability of this medication? (D) 67% (A) 48% (B) 53% (C) 59% (E) 71%
Reason: Reasoning: The absolute bioavailability (F) of a drug can be calculated using the formula: F = (AUC_sublingual / AUC_intravenous) x (Dose_intravenous / Dose_sublingual). In this scenario, substituting the values (AUC_sublingual = 20 mg hr/L, AUC_intravenous = 15 mg hr/L, Dose_intravenous = 10 mg, Dose_sublingual = 25 mg) results in F = (20 / 15) x (10 / 25), which simplifies to 53%. This indicates that 53% of the sublingually administered drug reaches systemic circulation compared to the intravenous route.

Reason: The answer is (B) II (represented on image as H band) because the H band is the region of the sarcomere that contains only thick filaments (myosin) and is not overlapped by thin filaments (actin) during muscle contraction. As the muscle contracts, the thick filaments pull the thin filaments towards the M line, and during this process, the active substance in the energy drink would have the highest chance to interact with the myosin in this region, thus exhibiting greater affinity.
Answer: (B) II (represented on image as H band)

Question: A 52-year-old woman comes to the physician because of swelling of her legs for 2 months. She has noticed that her legs gradually swell up throughout the day. Two years ago, she underwent a coronary angioplasty. She has hypertension and coronary artery disease. She works as a waitress at a local diner. Her father died of liver cancer at the age of 61 years. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 31 years. She drinks one to two glasses of wine daily and occasionally more on weekends. Current medications include aspirin, metoprolol, and rosuvastatin. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows 2+ pitting edema in the lower extremities. There are several dilated, tortuous veins over both calves. Multiple excoriation marks are noted over both ankles. Peripheral pulses are palpated bilaterally. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination shows no murmurs, gallops, or rubs. The abdomen is soft and nontender; there is no organomegaly. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? (E) Abdominal ultrasound (D) Adjust antihypertensive medication (C) Compression stockings (B) Sclerotherapy (A) CT scan of abdomen and pelvis
Reason: The answer is (C) Compression stockings because the patient's symptoms suggest chronic venous insufficiency, characterized by leg swelling and the presence of dilated veins. Compression stockings can help improve venous return and reduce swelling, making them an appropriate first step in managing her condition.
Answer: (C) Compression stockings

Question: A 16-year-old girl is brought to the clinic by her mother for amenorrhea. The patient has never had a menstrual cycle and is worried as all her friends “have started to go through puberty.” She has been otherwise healthy with an uncomplicated birth history. “I told her not to worry since I also got my period late,” her mother reported during the encounter. Physical examination demonstrates Tanner stage 2 breasts, genital, and pubic hair. Temperature is 98.7 °F (37.1°C), blood pressure is 156/100mmHg, pulse is 92/min, and respirations are 12/min. What laboratory abnormalities would you expect to find in this patient? (D) Low levels of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (A) Elevated levels of 17-hydroxyprogesterone (E) Low levels of androstenedione (C) Elevated levels of 17-hydroxypregnenolone (B) Elevated levels of androstenedione
Reason: The answer is (E) Low levels of androstenedione because the patient exhibits signs of delayed puberty and hypertension, which may suggest a condition like hypogonadotropic hypogonadism or other forms of adrenal insufficiency. In such a case, and considering the context of the patient's symptoms, one would expect low levels of key androgens like androstenedione due to insufficient adrenal or gonadal hormone production.
Answer: (E) Low levels of androstenedione
[INFO] Sampling path 10 completed.
[INFO] Opinion paths:
Path 1: Let's think step by step. The patient is presenting with a hypertensive emergency characterized by extremely high blood pressure, headache, chest pain, vomiting, papilledema, and altered consciousness, indicating possible end-organ damage. 

The medication described is likely nitroglycerin or another nitrates, which work by releasing nitric oxide, activating guanylate cyclase, and increasing cGMP levels, leading to smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation. This vasodilation primarily affects the venous system but can also lead to some arterial dilation.

In this context, the expected clinical effect would be a decrease in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) due to venous dilation, which decreases preload and subsequently reduces the pressure in the pulmonary circulation. This is particularly important in hypertensive emergencies where heart failure or pulmonary congestion might be present.

Thus, the correct answer is:
(D) Decreased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure.
Path 2: Let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. The patient is in a hypertensive emergency, with severely elevated blood pressure (220/140 mmHg), headache, chest pain, vomiting, papilledema, and a depressed level of consciousness. This indicates significant end-organ damage and requires urgent treatment.

2. The medication used in this scenario is likely a vasodilator that acts by releasing nitric oxide (NO), which activates guanylate cyclase and increases cGMP in vascular smooth muscle, leading to vasodilation.

3. The clinical effects of a medication that causes vasodilation would typically include:
   - Decreased systemic vascular resistance (SVR) due to relaxation of blood vessels.
   - Decreased blood pressure as a result of lowered SVR.
   - Decreased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) due to reduced left atrial pressure from decreased cardiac filling pressures.
   - Potentially increased stroke volume and improved cardiac output if the heart can compensate for the decreased afterload.

4. Among the options provided:
   - (D) Decreased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure is consistent with the effects of vasodilation and reduced preload.
   - (E) Increased systemic vascular resistance would not occur with a vasodilator.
   - (C) Decreased stroke volume is not expected; it may increase or remain unchanged.
   - (A) Decreased cardiac contractility is not a direct effect of vasodilation.
   - (B) Increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure is not expected as vasodilation reduces preload.

Given this reasoning, the most appropriate answer is:

**Answer: (D) Decreased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure**
Path 3: Let's analyze the scenario step by step. The patient is experiencing a hypertensive emergency, which is characterized by severely elevated blood pressure and end-organ damage, as indicated by symptoms like headache, chest pain, vomiting, papilledema, and altered mental status.

The medication mentioned is likely a vasodilator that releases nitric oxide (NO). A common agent used in hypertensive emergencies that works this way is **nitroglycerin**. Nitric oxide activates guanylate cyclase, leading to increased levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) in vascular smooth muscle, resulting in vasodilation.

**Effects of vasodilation** include:

1. **Decreased systemic vascular resistance (SVR)**: This is the primary action of vasodilators; they help to reduce blood pressure by dilating blood vessels.
2. **Decreased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP)**: As systemic vascular resistance decreases, the heart does not have to work as hard to pump blood against the resistance, potentially leading to lower pressure in the heart chambers during diastole.
3. **Decreased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP)**: This reflects left atrial pressure and can decrease due to reduced preload and afterload from vasodilation.

Considering the options provided:

- (D) **Decreased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure**: This is a likely effect of the vasodilator, as reduced vascular resistance can decrease the pressure in the pulmonary circulation.
- (E) **Increased systemic vascular resistance**: This is incorrect as vasodilators decrease SVR.
- (C) **Decreased stroke volume**: This is less likely; stroke volume may not directly decrease and can even remain stable or increase due to better systemic perfusion.
- (A) **Decreased cardiac contractility**: This is incorrect; vasodilators do not primarily affect contractility directly.
- (B) **Increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure**: This is also incorrect; vasodilation typically leads to decreased pressure.

Therefore, the best answer indicating the expected clinical effect from the administration of this medication is:

**Answer: (D) Decreased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure.**
Path 4: The medication described in the scenario is likely nitroprusside, which is an intravenous agent used to rapidly treat hypertensive emergencies. It works by releasing nitric oxide, which activates guanylate cyclase, leading to an increase in cGMP and subsequent vasodilation.

Now, let's evaluate the options based on the expected effects of nitroprusside:

- (D) Decreased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure: This is likely correct, as nitroprusside reduces systemic vascular resistance and can decrease left atrial pressure, leading to a decrease in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure.
  
- (E) Increased systemic vascular resistance: This is incorrect because nitroprusside causes vasodilation and decreases systemic vascular resistance.
  
- (C) Decreased stroke volume: While there may be some decrease in stroke volume due to reduced afterload, this effect is not the primary expected outcome.
  
- (A) Decreased cardiac contractility: This is not a direct effect of nitroprusside.
  
- (B) Increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure: This is incorrect because nitroprusside typically decreases left ventricular end-diastolic pressure due to reduced preload and afterload.

Given this analysis, the most appropriate answer is: 

**(D) Decreased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure**.
Path 5: Let's analyze the situation step by step.

The patient is experiencing a hypertensive emergency with severely elevated blood pressure, headache, chest pain, vomiting, papilledema, and altered consciousness. The treatment involves an intravenous medication that releases nitric oxide, activating guanylate cyclase, which increases cGMP in vascular smooth muscle. 

The medication described is likely nitroglycerin or a similar agent, which works by vasodilation, leading to decreased systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and decreased preload.

Now, considering the options:

- (D) Decreased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure: This could occur due to decreased left atrial pressure from reduced preload, which is a possible effect.
- (E) Increased systemic vascular resistance: This would not occur as the medication is a vasodilator.
- (C) Decreased stroke volume: This is unlikely; stroke volume could decrease due to decreased preload, but the main effect is vasodilation leading to overall improved hemodynamics.
- (A) Decreased cardiac contractility: The medication does not primarily affect contractility.
- (B) Increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure: This is also unlikely as the medication reduces preload.

Given the information, the most appropriate expected clinical effect from the administration of this vasodilator medication in the context of this patient’s hypertensive emergency would be:

**(D) Decreased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure** 

This reflects the decrease in preload resulting from the vasodilation effect of the medication.
Path 6: Let's analyze the question step by step. The scenario describes a patient with a hypertensive emergency, and the medication being used is one that releases nitric oxide, activating guanylate cyclase, and increasing cGMP in vascular smooth muscle. This mechanism is characteristic of vasodilators, such as nitroglycerin or nitroprusside.

When these medications cause vasodilation, the expected effects include:

- **Decreased systemic vascular resistance** (which would lead to lowered blood pressure).
- **Decreased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure** due to reduced left atrial pressure as a result of decreased systemic resistance and improved venous return.
- **Increased stroke volume** due to decreased afterload, making it easier for the heart to pump blood.
- **Decreased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure** as a result of improved left ventricular function and decreased volume overload.
- **Cardiac contractility** should not be significantly affected by these types of agents.

Given these points, the most logical expected clinical effect from administering a medication that increases cGMP and causes vasodilation (and thus reduces preload and afterload) is:

**(D) Decreased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure**

This is the most appropriate answer because vasodilation will lead to a reduction in pressures in the pulmonary circulation as well.
Path 7: Let's analyze the situation step by step.

The patient presents with a hypertensive emergency, characterized by very high blood pressure (220/140 mmHg), headache, chest pain, vomiting, papilledema, and altered consciousness. In such cases, it is critical to reduce the blood pressure rapidly but safely to prevent further organ damage.

The medication mentioned is an intravenous agent that releases nitric oxide (NO). Nitric oxide is a potent vasodilator that works by activating guanylate cyclase, leading to increased levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) in vascular smooth muscle, resulting in relaxation of the muscles and subsequent vasodilation.

Given this mechanism of action, we can deduce the expected clinical effects of administering this medication:

1. **Decreased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (D)**: As systemic vascular resistance decreases due to vasodilation, the pressure in the pulmonary circulation would also decrease, leading to a reduction in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure.

2. **Increased systemic vascular resistance (E)**: This would not be expected, as the drug causes vasodilation, which decreases systemic vascular resistance.

3. **Decreased stroke volume (C)**: The drug is likely to decrease afterload due to vasodilation, which may lead to an increase in stroke volume rather than a decrease.

4. **Decreased cardiac contractility (A)**: The drug primarily affects vascular smooth muscle and does not directly decrease cardiac contractility.

5. **Increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (B)**: This is unlikely, as vasodilation tends to reduce the workload on the heart, potentially decreasing LVEDP.

Given the above reasoning, the most expected clinical effect from the administration of the nitric oxide-releasing medication would be:

**(D) Decreased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure.**
Path 8: Let's analyze the question step by step. 

The patient is experiencing a hypertensive emergency, characterized by severely elevated blood pressure (220/140 mmHg), headache, chest pain, vomiting, papilledema, and altered consciousness. The treatment involves an intravenous medication that releases nitric oxide, activating guanylate cyclase and increasing cGMP in vascular smooth muscle, which typically leads to vasodilation.

1. **Mechanism of Action**: The medication mentioned releases nitric oxide, which causes relaxation of vascular smooth muscle, leading to vasodilation and a decrease in systemic vascular resistance (SVR).

2. **Expected Clinical Effects**: 
   - **Decreased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (D)**: This is likely, as vasodilation can reduce the pressures in the pulmonary circulation.
   - **Increased systemic vascular resistance (E)**: This would not be expected because the drug causes vasodilation.
   - **Decreased stroke volume (C)**: Stroke volume may decrease if afterload is significantly reduced, but this is not a direct effect and varies with other factors.
   - **Decreased cardiac contractility (A)**: This is not a primary effect of this medication.
   - **Increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (B)**: This would typically not occur with vasodilation.

Considering the treatment's effect of vasodilation on the cardiovascular system, the best expected outcome from the administration of this medication would be a decrease in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (D), as vasodilation reduces the afterload and pulmonary congestion.

**Answer**: (D) Decreased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure.
Path 9: In this scenario, the patient is experiencing a hypertensive emergency and is being treated with an IV medication that releases nitric oxide, leading to increased cGMP in vascular smooth muscle. This mechanism indicates that the drug is likely a vasodilator.

When a vasodilator is administered, we can expect several physiological effects:

1. **Decreased systemic vascular resistance (SVR)**: Vasodilation reduces the resistance the heart has to work against, leading to decreased blood pressure.
2. **Decreased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP)**: As systemic vascular resistance decreases, there is less pressure in the left ventricle during diastole.
3. **Decreased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP)**: This is a reflection of left atrial pressure and is expected to decrease due to the reduction in left ventricular pressures.

Among the options given:

- (D) Decreased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure: **This is expected as a result of vasodilation.**
- (E) Increased systemic vascular resistance: **This is not expected; systemic vascular resistance would decrease.**
- (C) Decreased stroke volume: **This is not directly expected; stroke volume may decrease if afterload significantly decreases, but vasodilation can also increase stroke volume initially.**
- (A) Decreased cardiac contractility: **This is not expected; the medication does not reduce contractility.**
- (B) Increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure: **This is not expected; LVEDP would decrease.**

Thus, the most appropriate expected clinical effect from the administration of the medication is:

**Answer: (D) Decreased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure**.
Path 10: Let's analyze the situation step by step. The patient presents with a hypertensive emergency characterized by severely elevated blood pressure, headache, chest pain, vomiting, papilledema, and altered consciousness. The medication used here is likely one that causes vasodilation through the release of nitric oxide, leading to increased cGMP levels in vascular smooth muscle.

1. **Mechanism of Action**: The drug releases nitric oxide, which activates guanylate cyclase, increasing cGMP and causing vasodilation.
2. **Expected Clinical Effects**: 
   - The vasodilation will lead to decreased systemic vascular resistance (SVR), which typically results in lower blood pressure.
   - With decreased vascular resistance, there is also generally a decrease in left ventricular (LV) afterload, which can improve cardiac output.
   - Additionally, in cases of hypertensive emergencies, the reduced pressure can lead to a decrease in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) due to reduced left atrial pressure.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:
- (D) Decreased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure: **This is likely true, as vasodilation reduces left atrial pressure and subsequent pulmonary pressures.**
- (E) Increased systemic vascular resistance: **This is incorrect, as the drug causes vasodilation, leading to decreased SVR.**
- (C) Decreased stroke volume: **This is unlikely; vasodilation typically helps improve stroke volume unless there is significant fluid loss or other factors.**
- (A) Decreased cardiac contractility: **This is not a direct effect of the medication; it primarily causes vasodilation.**
- (B) Increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure: **This would not be expected; it would likely decrease with effective treatment.**

Based on this analysis, the best answer is:

**Answer: (D) Decreased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure.**

Question: A 13-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department with respiratory distress, fever, and a productive cough. Past medical history is significant for a history of recurrent bronchopneumonia since the age of 5, managed conservatively with antibiotics and mucolytic therapy. The patient’s weight was normal at birth, but he suffered from a failure to thrive, although there was no neonatal history of chronic diarrhea or jaundice. His current vitals are a respiratory rate of 26/min, a pulse of 96/min, a temperature of 38.8℃ (101.8°F), a blood pressure of 90/60 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation of 88% on room air. On physical examination, there is coarse crepitus bilaterally and both expiratory and inspiratory wheezing is present. The chest radiograph shows evidence of diffuse emphysema. A sweat chloride test and nitro tetrazolium test are both within normal limits. A complete blood count is significant for the following:
WBC 26300/mm3
Neutrophils 62%
Lymphocytes 36%
Eosinophils 2%
Total bilirubin 0.8 mg/dL
Direct bilirubin 0.2 mg/dL
SGOT 100 U/L
SGPT 120 U/L
ALP 200 U/L
Results of serum protein electrophoresis are shown in the figure. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient? (E) Chronic granulomatous disease (B) Kartagener syndrome (D) Wilson’s disease (A) Cystic fibrosis (C) Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency
Reason: In this case, the patient's history of recurrent bronchopneumonia, respiratory distress, and the findings of diffuse emphysema on chest radiograph are suggestive of underlying lung pathology. Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is associated with both respiratory issues (due to lack of protease inhibition leading to lung tissue damage) and liver function abnormalities as indicated by the elevated liver enzymes in the blood work. The absence of typical cystic fibrosis symptoms, such as a positive sweat chloride test and the patient's history of failure to thrive and recurrent infections aligns more with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency as the most likely diagnosis.
Answer: (C) Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency

Question: A 35-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 20 minutes after being involved in a motor vehicle collision in which he was a restrained passenger. The patient is confused. His pulse is 140/min and blood pressure is 85/60 mm Hg. Examination shows a hand-sized hematoma on the anterior chest wall. An ECG shows sinus tachycardia. Which of the following structures is most likely injured in this patient? (A) Papillary muscle (D) Inferior vena cava (E) Left main coronary artery (C) Aortic valve (B) Aortic isthmus
Reason: In this scenario, the patient exhibits signs of hypovolemic shock, such as confusion, tachycardia, and hypotension, following a motor vehicle collision, which suggests significant internal bleeding or vascular injury. The aortic isthmus is a common site of injury in high-impact trauma due to its anatomical position and increased mobility, making it susceptible to laceration or transection, especially in deceleration injuries. Thus, the clinical presentation aligns with a possible injury to the aortic isthmus.
Answer: (B) Aortic isthmus

Question: A 40-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 1-week history of fatigue, dark urine, and a feeling of heaviness in her legs. Two weeks ago, she returned from a vacation to Brazil, where she spent most of her days exploring the city of Rio de Janeiro on foot. She also gained 3 kg (7 lb) during her vacation. She has systemic lupus erythematosus. Her only medication is hydroxychloroquine. Her temperature is 37.5°C (99.5°F), pulse is 78/min, and blood pressure is 162/98 mm Hg. Physical examination shows 2+ pretibial edema bilaterally. Urinalysis shows:
Blood 3+
Protein 1+
RBC 6–8/hpf with dysmorphic features
RBC casts numerous
WBC 8/hpf
WBC casts rare
Bacteria negative
Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's leg findings?" (B) Lymphatic obstruction (D) Renal protein loss (E) Salt retention (A) Venous insufficiency (C) Increased capillary permeability
Reason: In this case, the patient's recent return from Brazil, coupled with her symptoms of fatigue, dark urine, and bilateral pretibial edema, suggests fluid retention likely related to kidney function. The urinalysis findings of protein and RBC casts indicate a renal process, such as glomerulonephritis, which can lead to salt and water retention due to impaired kidney function, ultimately contributing to the leg swelling observed as pretibial edema. Thus, the most likely cause of her symptoms is salt retention as a result of renal impairment.
Answer: (E) Salt retention

Question: A 47-year-old man presents to his primary care physician for fatigue. Over the past 3 months, his tiredness has impacted his ability to work as a corporate lawyer. He denies any changes to his diet, exercise regimen, bowel movements, or urinary frequency. His past medical history is notable for obesity, type II diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. He takes metformin and enalapril. His family history is notable for colorectal cancer in his father and paternal grandfather and endometrial cancer in his paternal aunt. He has a 20-pack-year smoking history and drinks one 6-pack of beer a week. His temperature is 98.8°F (37.1°C), blood pressure is 129/71 mmHg, pulse is 82/min, and respirations are 17/min. On exam, he has conjunctival pallor. A stool sample is positive for occult blood. A colonoscopy reveals a small hemorrhagic mass at the junction of the ascending and transverse colon. Which of the following processes is likely impaired in this patient? (A) Base excision repair (B) Homologous recombination (D) Non-homologous end joining (C) Mismatch repair (E) Nucleotide excision repair
Reason: Mismatch repair is likely impaired in this patient due to his family history of colorectal cancer, which raises the suspicion of a hereditary cancer syndrome such as Lynch syndrome (hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer). This condition is associated with defects in the mismatch repair mechanism, leading to an increased risk of colorectal and other cancers, which aligns with the presentation of a hemorrhagic mass and positive occult blood in this patient.
Answer: (C) Mismatch repair

Question: A 9-month-old baby boy is brought to his pediatrician due to poor feeding and fewer bowel movements. His father notes that he has been less active and is having difficulty with movements such as rolling over. Vital signs are normal, and physical exam is notable for weak sucking reflex, ptosis, and decreased eye movements. In addition, the baby has generalized weakness and flushed skin. Stool samples are collected, treatment is started immediately, and the baby’s condition improves. The results of the stool studies return several days later and show gram-positive, anaerobic rods. The toxin most likely responsible for this baby’s condition acts through which mechanism? (A) Inhibition of neurotransmitter release (D) Increased chloride secretion within the gut (C) Degradation of the cell membrane (E) Impairment of phagocytosis (B) Inhibition of protein synthesis
Reason: The baby's symptoms, including weakness, poor feeding, and the presence of ptosis and decreased eye movements, suggest a neuromuscular disorder. The identification of gram-positive, anaerobic rods in the stool supports the diagnosis of botulism, in which the toxin produced by Clostridium botulinum functions by inhibiting the release of neurotransmitters at the neuromuscular junction, leading to muscle weakness and paralysis.
Answer: (A) Inhibition of neurotransmitter release

Question: A 38-year-old man comes to the physician because of fever, malaise, cough, and shortness of breath for 2 months. He has had a 4-kg (9-lb) weight loss during the same period. He works at a flour mill and does not smoke cigarettes. His temperature is 38.1°C (100.6°F) and pulse oximetry shows 95% on room air. Diffuse fine crackles are heard over both lung fields. A chest x-ray shows patchy reticulonodular infiltrates in the mid and apical lung fields bilaterally. A photomicrograph of a lung biopsy specimen is shown. Which of the following cytokines have the greatest involvement in the pathogenesis of the lesion indicated by the arrow? (E) Transforming growth factor beta and interleukin-12 (A) Tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-4 (D) Interleukin-4 and interleukin-10 (B) Interferon gamma and interleukin-2 (C) Interferon alpha and interleukin-1
Reason: The patient's symptoms—particularly the cough, shortness of breath, weight loss, and chest x-ray findings—suggest a chronic granulomatous process, which could indicate an infectious or inflammatory disease linked to environmental exposure, such as pulmonary histoplasmosis or sarcoidosis. The cytokines interferon gamma and interleukin-2 are key players in the immune response to intracellular pathogens and are prominent in Th1 cells, which are typically involved in granuloma formation and the response to such respiratory conditions.

Question: A 48-year-old woman presents with severe chest pain for 2 hours. An episode of severe retching and bloody vomiting preceded the onset of chest pain. She says she had an episode of binge drinking last night. Past medical history includes a gastric ulcer 5 years ago, status post-surgical repair. Her blood pressure is 110/68 mm Hg, pulse is 90/min, respiratory rate is 18/min, and oxygen saturation is 90% on room air. ECG is unremarkable. Her cardiovascular examination is normal. Crepitus is heard over the left lower lobe of the lung. Which of the following is the most likely etiology of this patient’s symptoms? (D) Helicobacter pylori infection (A) Linear laceration at the gastroesophageal junction (B) Horizontal partition in the tunica media of the aorta (E) Infarction of the myocardium (C) Rupture of the esophagus due to increased intraluminal pressure
Reason: The patient's symptoms of severe chest pain following an episode of retching and bloody vomiting, along with the presence of crepitus over the left lower lobe, are indicative of a possible esophageal rupture, known as Boerhaave syndrome. This condition occurs when increased intraluminal pressure from forceful vomiting leads to a tear in the esophageal wall, resulting in leakage of air and fluids into the mediastinum, which can cause the crepitus noted on examination.
Answer: (C) Rupture of the esophagus due to increased intraluminal pressure

Question: A 48-year-old man presents to a physician with complaints of paresthesia of the lower extremities, which he has had for the last 3 months. He has been frequently fatigued for the past 5 months and also experienced an increased frequency of urination over the last few months. There is no history of a known medical condition or of substance abuse. His physical examination does not reveal any specific abnormality, except that he is obese: his body mass index is 34.6 kg/m2. The patient’s detailed laboratory evaluation reveals a fasting plasma glucose of 160 mg/dL and 2-hour plasma glucose of 270 mg/dL. His physician tells him that his laboratory evaluation suggests a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus type 2. The patient, surprised by this news, asks his physician why he has developed diabetes mellitus even though no one else in his family has ever suffered from it. The physician explains to him that genetic factors play an important role in the development of diabetes mellitus, but that their interactions are complex. Apart from neonatal diabetes mellitus and maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY), the development of diabetes mellitus cannot be explained by a single genetic mutation. Which of the following options best explains the genetics of the form of diabetes mellitus from which this man is suffering? (A) Anticipation (E) Synergistic epistasis (B) Genomic imprinting (C) Natural selection (D) Polygenic inheritance
Reason: The answer is (D) Polygenic inheritance because type 2 diabetes mellitus arises from the cumulative effects of multiple genes that influence various risk factors, such as insulin resistance and beta-cell function, rather than from a single genetic mutation. This complex interplay of multiple genetic and environmental factors is characteristic of many common diseases, including type 2 diabetes, which explains why this patient may develop the condition even without a direct family history.
Answer: (D) Polygenic inheritance

Question: A 23-year-old woman presents with a 4-week menstrual delay. She also complains of irritability, increased somnolence, and occasional nausea. She had her first menarche at the age of 13, and her menstrual cycle became regular at the age of 15. She has been sexually active since the age of 20 but has had the same sexual partner since then. They stopped using birth control protection approximately 6 months ago. She does not smoke and consumes alcohol occasionally. Her blood pressure is 120/80 mm Hg, heart rate is 71/min, respiratory rate is 14/min, and temperature is 36.6℃ (98.2℉). Physical examination is significant only for slight breast engorgement and nipple pigmentation. Gynecologic examination reveals cervical softening and cyanosis. Which of the following drugs would be recommended for this patient? (A) Progesterone (B) Biphasic oral contraceptive (C) Folic acid (E) Combination of natural estrogen and progestin (D) Vitamin A
Reason: The answer is (C) Folic acid because the patient is likely pregnant, as indicated by her missed menstrual period, breast changes, and cervical signs. Folic acid is recommended during pregnancy to prevent neural tube defects in the developing fetus, making it a crucial supplement for her at this stage.
Answer: (C) Folic acid

Question: A 24-year-old female comes to the physician because of flu-like symptoms and a new rash for 2 days. She denies contacts with sick individuals or recent travel abroad, but recently went camping in Vermont. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the lateral right thigh shows a circular red ring with central clearing. Which of the following is the natural reservoir of the pathogen responsible for this patient's symptoms? (C) Rabbit (A) Rat (D) Tick (E) Flea (B) Mouse
Reason: The correct answer is (D) Tick. The symptoms and the appearance of a circular red ring with central clearing suggest Lyme disease, which is caused by the bacterium *Borrelia burgdorferi*. Ticks, particularly the deer tick (or black-legged tick), are the natural reservoir for this pathogen, especially in regions like Vermont where Lyme disease is prevalent. 

To support this, I would reason that the patient's recent camping trip in Vermont increases the likelihood of exposure to ticks, which are known to transmit Lyme disease and create rashes characterized by a "bull's-eye" appearance. Hence, this aligns with the symptoms and setting of the case.
Answer: (B) Mouse

Question: An 18-month-old boy is brought in by his parents for a routine check-up. The parents state that the patient still has not had any language development, and they are concerned about developmental delay. Of note, they have also noticed that the patient’s facial features have changed significantly in the last year. The patient also seems to have trouble visually focusing on objects or on the television. On exam, the patient's temperature is 98.2°F (36.8°C), blood pressure is 108/72 mmHg, pulse is 86/min, and respirations are 14/min. Of interest, the patient has not increased much in length or weight in the past 3 months. He is now in the 25th percentile for weight but is in the 90th percentile for head circumference. The patient does not appear to have any gross or fine motor deficiencies. Of note, he has coarse facial features that were not previously noted, including a long face, prominent forehead, and protruding eyes. The patient has corneal clouding bilaterally. At rest, the patient keeps his mouth hanging open. After extensive workup, the patient is found to have 2 mutated copies of the IDUA gene, with no production of the protein iduronidase. Which of the following is the likely mutation found in this disease? (E) Silent mutation (B) Interstitial deletion (A) Chromosomal translocation (C) Missense mutation (D) Nonsense mutation
Reason: The correct answer is (D) Nonsense mutation. The clinical presentation describes a boy with significant developmental delays, characteristic coarse facial features, and corneal clouding, which aligns with mucopolysaccharidosis type I (Hurler syndrome) caused by a deficiency of the enzyme iduronidase due to mutations in the IDUA gene.

To support this reasoning, I would note that nonsense mutations lead to premature stop codons, resulting in truncated, nonfunctional proteins, which is consistent with the complete absence of iduronidase production in this patient. Such mutations would explain the severe phenotype observed, as a lack of functional enzyme leads to the accumulation of glycosaminoglycans and the associated symptoms.
Answer: (D) Nonsense mutation

Question: A 42-year-old man presents for evaluation of vitamin D deficiency with possible osteomalacia. The patient had a pathologic fracture 3 weeks ago and was found to have dangerously low levels of vitamin D with normal serum calcium levels. Bone density has been drastically affected, leading to the fracture this patient experienced. The lack of what compound is most responsible for the formation of this disease? (D) PTH (E) 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (A) Calcifediol (C) Vitamin D binding protein (B) Calcitriol
Reason: The correct answer is (B) Calcitriol. In the context of vitamin D deficiency leading to osteomalacia, calcitriol (the active form of vitamin D) plays a critical role in promoting calcium and phosphate absorption in the intestines, which is essential for proper bone mineralization.

To support this, I would reason that without sufficient levels of calcitriol, the body cannot adequately absorb calcium and phosphate, leading to weakened bone structure and an increased risk of fractures, as seen in this patient's case of osteomalacia. This highlights the importance of calcitriol in maintaining bone health and preventing associated skeletal complications.
Answer: (B) Calcitriol

Question: A 49-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after being discovered unconscious in a field near the county fair. Several empty bottles of vodka were found near him. On arrival, he is mumbling incoherently. He appears malodorous and disheveled. Serum studies show:
Na+ 150 mEq/L
K+ 3.3 mEq/L
Cl- 115 mEq/L
HCO3- 13 mEq/L
Urea nitrogen 30 mg/dL
Glucose 75 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.4 mg/dL
Lactic acid 6 mmol/L (N < 2)
Which of the following changes to enzyme activity best explains this patient's laboratory findings?" (D) Decreased activity of phosphofructokinase-2 (B) Increased activity of α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (A) Decreased activity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (E) Decreased activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase (C) Increased activity of phenylalanine hydroxylase
Reason: The correct answer is (E) Decreased activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase because the patient's presentation suggests metabolic acidosis with elevated lactic acid, likely due to hypoxia or impaired metabolism, often seen in cases of severe alcohol intoxication. Alcohol metabolism can lead to an increase in NADH, which inhibits the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase, causing pyruvate to be converted to lactate instead of being metabolized in the Krebs cycle, resulting in lactic acidosis.
Answer: (E) Decreased activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase

Question: A 43-year-old woman comes to the office with a 3-day history of a rash. She's had a rash across her neck, shoulders, and the palms of her hands for the past five days. She's also had large-volume watery diarrhea for the same period of time. Past medical history is notable for acute myeloid leukemia, for which she received a stem cell transplant from a donor about two months prior. Physical exam reveals a faint red maculopapular rash across her neck, shoulders, and hands, as well as an enlarged liver and spleen. Labs are notable for a total bilirubin of 10. Which of the following is the mechanism of this patient's pathology? (C) Host antibodies that have developed against graft antigens (D) Host CD8+ T cells against graft antigens (A) Drug hypersensitivity reaction (E) Graft T cells against host antigens (B) Pre-existing host antibodies against graft antigens
Reason: The correct answer is (E) Graft T cells against host antigens, as this patient's symptoms and clinical history are consistent with acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) following stem cell transplantation. In GVHD, the donor T cells (graft) recognize the recipient's tissues (host) as foreign, leading to immune-mediated damage manifested as a rash, diarrhea, and liver dysfunction, which aligns with the patient's presenting symptoms and lab findings.
Answer: (E) Graft T cells against host antigens

Question: A 67-year-old woman comes to the clinic complaining of progressive fatigue over the past 4 months. She noticed that she is feeling increasingly short of breath after walking the same distance from the bus stop to her home. She denies chest pain, syncope, lower extremity edema, or a cough. She denies difficulty breathing while sitting comfortably, but she has increased dyspnea upon walking or other mildly strenuous activity. Her past medical history includes mild osteoporosis and occasional gastric reflux disease. She takes oral omeprazole as needed and a daily baby aspirin. The patient is a retired accountant and denies smoking history, but she does admit to 1 small glass of red wine daily for the past 5 years. Her diet consists of a Mediterranean diet that includes fruits, vegetables, and fish. She states that she has been very healthy previously, and managed her own health without a physician for the past 20 years. On physical examination, she has a blood pressure of 128/72 mm Hg, a pulse of 87/min, and an oxygen saturation of 94% on room air. HEENT examination demonstrates mild conjunctival pallor. Lung and abdominal examinations are within normal limits. Heart examination reveals a 2/6 systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border.
The following laboratory values are obtained:
Hematocrit 29%
Hemoglobin 9.8 mg/dL
Mean red blood cell volume 78 fL
Platelets 240,000/mm3
White blood cells 6,000/mm3
What is the most likely reticulocyte range for this patient? (C) > 1.5% (A) < 1% (D) >5% (E) >7% (B) 0%
Reason: The correct answer is (A) < 1% because the patient's anemia is characterized by a low hemoglobin level with a low mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 78 fL, indicating microcytic anemia, likely due to iron deficiency. In cases of iron deficiency anemia, the reticulocyte count is typically low or normal (< 1%) because there is insufficient iron available for the bone marrow to produce new red blood cells in response to the anemia.

Question: An immunology expert is explaining the functions of macrophages to biology students. He describes a hypothetical case scenario as follows: a potentially harmful gram-negative bacillus encounters a macrophage in the tissues. The Toll-like receptor (TLR) on the macrophage recognizes the bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The macrophage is activated by the binding of TLR with bacterial LPS and by interferon-γ (IFN-γ). Which of the following cytokines is most likely to be secreted by the activated macrophage? (C) Interleukin-4 (IL-4) (D) Interleukin-10 (IL-10) (A) Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) (B) Interleukin-2 (IL-2) (E) Interleukin-12 (IL-12)
Reason: The activated macrophage in this scenario is likely to secrete Interleukin-12 (IL-12) as a response to its activation by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) recognizing bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and the presence of interferon-γ (IFN-γ). IL-12 plays a critical role in promoting Th1 cell differentiation and enhancing the immune response against intracellular pathogens, which is consistent with the macrophage's involvement in combating gram-negative bacilli.

Path 1: Let's think step by step. 

Cilostazol is a medication commonly used to treat intermittent claudication in patients with peripheral artery disease. Its primary mechanism of action involves the inhibition of phosphodiesterase (PDE), specifically phosphodiesterase type 3 (PDE3). By inhibiting this enzyme, cilostazol increases the levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) within platelets and vascular smooth muscle cells, leading to vasodilation and reduced platelet aggregation.

Given this mechanism of action, the correct answer to the question is:

**Answer: (E) Phosphodiesterase inhibitor**
Path 2: To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the medication cilostazol and its mechanism of action.

Cilostazol is primarily used to treat intermittent claudication in patients with peripheral artery disease. Its mechanism involves:

1. **Phosphodiesterase Inhibition**: Cilostazol inhibits phosphodiesterase type 3 (PDE3), which leads to an increase in cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels within platelets and vascular smooth muscle cells.
2. **Effects on Vascular Smooth Muscle**: The increase in cAMP results in vasodilation and improved blood flow, which is beneficial for patients with peripheral artery disease.
3. **Antiplatelet Effects**: Increased cAMP also inhibits platelet aggregation, providing an additional benefit for patients at risk of thrombotic events.

Given these points, the correct answer regarding the mechanism of action of cilostazol is:

**Answer: (E) Phosphodiesterase inhibitor**.
Path 3: Let's think through the options step by step.

Cilostazol is a medication commonly used to treat intermittent claudication due to peripheral artery disease. Its primary mechanism of action involves the inhibition of phosphodiesterase, which leads to an increase in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels in platelets and vascular smooth muscle cells. This mechanism results in vasodilation and inhibition of platelet aggregation.

Now, looking at the provided options:

(A) Irreversible cyclooxygenase inhibitor – This is not applicable to cilostazol.
(B) Glycoprotein IIB/IIIA inhibitor – These are antiplatelet agents and do not describe cilostazol.
(C) Thromboxane synthase inhibitor – This does not describe cilostazol's mechanism.
(D) Adenosine diphosphate receptor inhibitor – This refers to another class of antiplatelet drugs, not cilostazol.
(E) Phosphodiesterase inhibitor – This is the correct mechanism of action for cilostazol.

Therefore, the correct answer is: **(E) Phosphodiesterase inhibitor**.
Path 4: Let's think step by step. The patient has been diagnosed with peripheral artery disease (PAD) and is experiencing intermittent claudication. Cilostazol is a medication commonly used to treat symptoms of claudication in patients with PAD.

The mechanism of action of cilostazol is that it is a **phosphodiesterase inhibitor** (specifically, it inhibits phosphodiesterase type 3). By inhibiting this enzyme, cilostazol increases the levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in platelets and vascular smooth muscle, leading to vasodilation and inhibition of platelet aggregation.

Therefore, the correct answer is: 

**(E) Phosphodiesterase inhibitor**.
Path 5: Let's analyze the question step by step. The patient has been diagnosed with peripheral artery disease (PAD) and has been prescribed cilostazol.

1. **Understanding Cilostazol**: Cilostazol is a medication commonly used to treat intermittent claudication in patients with PAD. 

2. **Mechanism of Action**: Cilostazol is primarily known for its ability to improve blood flow by inhibiting platelet aggregation and causing vasodilation. 

3. **Identifying the Correct Option**: Cilostazol works as a phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor, specifically phosphodiesterase type 3 (PDE3). By inhibiting this enzyme, cilostazol increases the levels of cyclic AMP (cAMP) in platelets and vascular smooth muscle, leading to decreased platelet aggregation and vasodilation.

Given this information, the correct answer is:

**(E) Phosphodiesterase inhibitor**.
Path 6: To determine the mechanism of action of cilostazol, let's analyze the options provided:

Cilostazol is primarily used to treat intermittent claudication in patients with peripheral artery disease. Its mechanism of action involves:

1. **Phosphodiesterase Inhibition**: Cilostazol specifically inhibits phosphodiesterase type 3 (PDE3), which leads to an increase in intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels. This elevation of cAMP causes vasodilation and inhibits platelet aggregation.

Given this information, the correct answer is:

**(E) Phosphodiesterase inhibitor**.
Path 7: Let's analyze the options step by step. 

Cilostazol is primarily used to treat intermittent claudication due to peripheral artery disease. Its mechanism of action involves the enhancement of blood flow and reduction of symptoms associated with claudication.

1. **Irreversible cyclooxygenase inhibitor (A)**: This refers to medications like aspirin, which inhibit the production of thromboxane and prostaglandins. This is not the mechanism of cilostazol.

2. **Glycoprotein IIB/IIIA inhibitor (B)**: These drugs are used as antiplatelet agents in conditions like acute coronary syndrome but do not describe cilostazol's action.

3. **Thromboxane synthase inhibitor (C)**: This would inhibit thromboxane production, which does not align with cilostazol's mechanism.

4. **Adenosine diphosphate receptor inhibitor (D)**: These are also antiplatelet agents but do not pertain to cilostazol.

5. **Phosphodiesterase inhibitor (E)**: Cilostazol acts by inhibiting phosphodiesterase type 3 (PDE3), which leads to increased levels of cyclic AMP (cAMP) in platelets and vascular tissue. This results in vasodilation and inhibition of platelet aggregation.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is:

**Answer: (E) Phosphodiesterase inhibitor**.
Path 8: Let's think step by step. Cilostazol is used to treat symptoms of intermittent claudication in patients with peripheral artery disease. Its primary mechanism of action is as a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. By inhibiting phosphodiesterase type 3 (PDE3), cilostazol increases the levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) within platelets and vascular smooth muscle cells, leading to vasodilation and inhibition of platelet aggregation. 

Given the options provided, the correct answer is: 

(E) Phosphodiesterase inhibitor.
Path 9: Let's think step by step. Reason: Cilostazol is primarily used to treat symptoms of intermittent claudication in patients with peripheral artery disease. Its mechanism of action involves the inhibition of phosphodiesterase type 3 (PDE3), which leads to increased levels of cyclic AMP (cAMP) in platelets and vascular smooth muscle cells. This results in vasodilation and inhibition of platelet aggregation. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: (E) Phosphodiesterase inhibitor
Path 10: Let's think step by step. 

Cilostazol is a medication commonly used to treat symptoms of intermittent claudication in patients with peripheral artery disease. Its primary mechanism of action is as a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. By inhibiting phosphodiesterase, cilostazol increases the levels of cyclic AMP (cAMP) within platelets and vascular smooth muscle cells, leading to vasodilation and inhibition of platelet aggregation.

Thus, the correct answer is: (E) Phosphodiesterase inhibitor.
[INFO] Final decision by majority voting
After reviewing the 10 different reasoning paths and their corresponding answers, it is clear that all paths consistently identify cilostazol as a **phosphodiesterase inhibitor**. Each path explains the mechanism of action of cilostazol in a similar manner, emphasizing its role in inhibiting phosphodiesterase type 3 (PDE3), leading to increased levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), vasodilation, and reduced platelet aggregation.

Since all paths arrive at the same conclusion, the majority vote clearly supports the answer:

**(E) Phosphodiesterase inhibitor**. 

This will be the final decision.

Question: A 25-year-old woman gives birth to a male child at 30 weeks of gestation. Pregnancy was complicated by polyhydramnios diagnosed on ultrasonography at 26 weeks of gestation. The baby is born vaginally weighing 1.2 kg (2.64 lb). Because he does not cry immediately after birth, endotracheal intubation is attempted to secure the airway. However, the vocal cords cannot be visualized because there is only a single opening corresponding to the esophagus. He is transferred to the NICU under bag and mask ventilation, where intubation is attempted once again by passing the endotracheal tube in the visualized opening, after which his oxygen saturation begins to improve. His temperature is 37.0ºC (98.6°F), pulse is 120/min, and respiratory rate is 42/min. On physical examination, no abnormalities are noted. Chest radiography is suggestive of respiratory distress syndrome. Which of the following most likely failed to develop in this patient? (E) Mesonephric duct (D) Fourth and sixth branchial arches (A) First branchial arch (B) Second branchial arch (C) Third branchial arch
Reason: The correct answer is (D) Fourth and sixth branchial arches. In this clinical scenario, the inability to visualize the vocal cords and the presence of a single opening corresponding to the esophagus suggests a serious developmental defect in the pharyngeal anatomy, specifically affecting the structures derived from the fourth and sixth branchial arches, which contribute to the formation of the larynx. This aligns with the observed airway management issues and respiratory distress in the newborn.
Answer: (D) Fourth and sixth branchial arches

Question: A 63-year-old man with high blood pressure, dyslipidemia, and diabetes presents to the clinic for routine follow-up. He has no current complaints and has been compliant with his chronic medications. His blood pressure is 132/87 mm Hg and his pulse is 75/min and regular. On physical examination, you notice that he has xanthelasmas on both of his eyelids. He currently uses a statin to lower his LDL but has not reached the LDL goal you have set for him. You would like to add an additional medication for LDL control. Of the following, which statement regarding fibrates is true? (E) Fibrates inhibit the rate-limiting step in cholesterol synthesis (B) Fibrates can cause significant skin flushing and pruritus (A) The primary effect of fibrates is to lower LDL (D) Fibrates can increase the risk of cataracts (C) Fibrates can potentiate the risk of myositis when given with statins
Reason: The correct answer is (C) Fibrates can potentiate the risk of myositis when given with statins. This statement is true because both fibrates and statins can independently increase the risk of muscle-related side effects; when used together, this risk is further amplified, which is a well-documented interaction in clinical practice. Thus, the combination of these medications requires careful monitoring for signs of muscle toxicity.
Answer: (C) Fibrates can potentiate the risk of myositis when given with statins

Question: A 7-year-old girl is brought to the physician by her father because of a dry cough, nasal congestion, and intermittent wheezing during the past 2 months. Since birth, she has had four upper respiratory tract infections that resolved without treatment and one episode of acute otitis media treated with antibiotics. She has a history of eczema. Her temperature is 37.1°C (98.7°F), and respirations are 28/min. Physical examination shows a shallow breathing pattern and scattered expiratory wheezing throughout both lung fields. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosing this patient’s condition? (D) Serum IgE levels (E) Spirometry (A) Methacholine challenge test (C) Chest x-ray (B) Arterial blood gas analysis
Reason: The correct answer is (E) Spirometry. In this clinical scenario, the girl's symptoms of dry cough, wheezing, and a history of eczema suggest an obstructive airway condition, likely asthma. Spirometry is the most appropriate next diagnostic step to assess lung function and determine the presence of any airway obstruction, which is crucial for confirming asthma in a patient with these symptoms.
Answer: (E) Spirometry

Question: A 35-year-old man who works in a shipyard presents with a sharp pain in his left big toe for the past 5 hours. He says he has had this kind of pain before a few days ago after an evening of heavy drinking with his friends. He says he took acetaminophen and ibuprofen for the pain as before but, unlike the last time, it hasn't helped. The patient denies any recent history of trauma or fever. No significant past medical history and no other current medications. Family history is significant for his mother who has type 2 diabetes mellitus and his father who has hypertension. The patient reports regular drinking and the occasional binge on the weekends but denies any smoking history or recreational drug use. The vital signs include pulse 86/min, respiratory rate 14/min, and blood pressure 130/80 mm Hg. On physical examination, the patient is slightly overweight and in obvious distress. The 1st metatarsophalangeal joint of the left foot is erythematous, severely tender to touch, and swollen. No obvious deformity is seen. The remainder of the examination is unremarkable. Joint arthrocentesis of the 1st left metatarsophalangeal joint reveals sodium urate crystals. Which of the following drugs would be the next best therapeutic step in this patient? (E) Naproxen (B) Morphine (A) Probenecid (C) Aspirin (D) Allopurinol
Reason: Naproxen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that helps alleviate pain and inflammation, which is appropriate in this case of acute gout flare, as indicated by the presence of sodium urate crystals in the joint fluid. The patient has already tried other pain relievers without relief, and naproxen would provide effective symptomatic management and is commonly used to treat acute gout attacks.
Answer: (E) Naproxen

Question: A 50-year-old man presents to his primary care physician with a chief complaint of chest pain that is squeezing in nature. He used to have similar symptoms in the past while playing tennis with his friends. Yesterday, while moving furniture in his new home, he experienced this pain that lasted for 20 minutes and radiated towards his jaw and shoulder. He has been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus and hypertension for over 10 years and regularly takes his medications. The pain is not associated with nausea, vomiting, food intake, sweating, or cough. On physical examination, the patient is not in acute distress. His blood pressure is 135/85 mm Hg, heart rate is 80/min, respiratory rate is 16/min, temperature is 36.9°C (98.5°F), and BMI is 30 kg/m2. On physical examination, bilateral vesicular breath sounds are heard with absent chest tenderness. Cardiovascular examination reveals normal S1 and S2 without any abnormal sounds or murmur. Abdominal examination is within normal limit. What is the most likely cause of this patient’s condition? (D) Anxiety (C) Rib fracture (A) GERD (B) Musculoskeletal pain (E) Myocardial ischemia
Reason: The patient's symptoms of squeezing chest pain that radiates to the jaw and shoulder, particularly during physical exertion such as moving furniture, suggest a pattern consistent with myocardial ischemia, commonly associated with coronary artery disease. Additionally, his risk factors, including diabetes and hypertension, further increase the likelihood of cardiac-related causes for his chest pain, making myocardial ischemia the most plausible diagnosis.
Answer: (E) Myocardial ischemia

Question: A 72-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 3-day history of redness and swelling of her right leg and fever. She says the leg is very painful and the redness over it has become larger. She appears ill. Her temperature is 39.3°C (102.7°F), pulse is 103/min, and blood pressure is 138/90 mm Hg. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. Examination shows an area of diffuse erythema and swelling over her anterior right lower leg; it is warm and tender to touch. Squeezing of the calf does not elicit tenderness. There is swelling of the right inguinal lymph nodes. Pedal pulses are palpable bilaterally. Which of the following is the strongest predisposing factor for this patient's condition? (D) Immobility (E) Tinea pedis
" (A) Rheumatoid arthritis (B) Graves disease (C) Cigarette smoking
Reason: The answer to the question is (D) Immobility. 

The patient's symptoms, including erythema, swelling, warmth, tenderness, and fever in one leg, suggest a possible diagnosis of cellulitis. Immobility is a significant predisposing factor for developing cellulitis because it can lead to venous stasis, impaired lymphatic drainage, and ultimately an increased risk of infection in the affected area. Tinea pedis, while a potential contributing factor for skin infections, is not as directly related to the acute presentation described in this case compared to the risks associated with immobility.
Answer: (E) Tinea pedis

Question: A 25-year-old man comes to the physician because of right-sided painless scrotal swelling that he noticed yesterday while taking a shower. He is currently sexually active with two female partners and uses condoms inconsistently. He immigrated to the US from Argentina 2 years ago. His immunization records are unavailable. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for the last 5 years. He is 170 cm (5 ft 7 in) tall and weighs 70 kg (154 lb); BMI is 24.2 kg/m2. He appears healthy and well nourished. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 72/min, and blood pressure is 125/75 mm Hg. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. The abdomen is soft with dull lower abdominal discomfort. Testicular examination shows a solid mass in the right testis that is firm and nontender. A light held behind the scrotum does not shine through. The mass is not reduced when the patient is in a supine position. The remainder of the physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient? (D) Testicular torsion (A) Orchitis (B) Hydrocele testis (E) Testicular tumor (C) Scrotal hernia
Reason: The answer to the question is (E) Testicular tumor. 

The clinical presentation of a solid, firm, and nontender testicular mass that does not transilluminate suggests a neoplastic process rather than a fluid-filled condition like a hydrocele or an acute condition like testicular torsion or orchitis. Additionally, the patient’s age and smoking history are risk factors for testicular cancer, making a testicular tumor the most likely diagnosis in this case.
Answer: (E) Testicular tumor

Question: A 67-year-old man presents to the physician with profuse watery diarrhea along with fever and crampy abdominal pain. He has been taking an antibiotic course of cefixime for about a week to treat a respiratory tract infection. At the doctor’s office, his pulse is 112/min, the blood pressure is 100/66 mm Hg, the respirations are 22/min, and the temperature is 38.9°C (102.0°F). His oral mucosa appears dry and his abdomen is soft with vague diffuse tenderness. A digital rectal examination is normal. Laboratory studies show:
Hemoglobin 11.1 g/dL
Hematocrit 33%
Total leucocyte count 16,000/mm3
Serum lactate 0.9 mmol/L
Serum creatinine 1.1 mg/dL
What is most likely to confirm the diagnosis? (D) Abdominal X-ray (E) CT scan of the abdomen (A) Identification of C. difficile toxin in stool (C) Colonoscopy (B) Stool culture
Reason: The answer to the question is (A) Identification of C. difficile toxin in stool. 

The clinical scenario indicates a patient with profuse watery diarrhea, fever, and abdominal pain after a course of antibiotics, which raises suspicion for Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). The definitive diagnosis of CDI can be confirmed by detecting the presence of C. difficile toxins in the stool, making this option the most appropriate diagnostic test in this case.
Answer: (A) Identification of C. difficile toxin in stool

Question: A previously healthy 9-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother because of a 3-month history of episodic abdominal pain. During this time, he has been more tired than usual. For the past 2 months, he has also had bulky stools that are difficult to flush. His maternal aunt has systemic lupus erythematosus. The boy is at the 31st percentile for height and 5th percentile for weight. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows scattered ecchymoses across bilateral knees, the left forearm, and the upper back. The abdomen is mildly distended; bowel sounds are hyperactive. Laboratory studies show:
Hemoglobin 11.1 g/dL
Leukocyte count 4,500/mm3
Platelet count 243,000/mm3
Mean corpuscular volume 78 μm3
Bleeding time 5 minutes
Prothrombin time 24 seconds
Partial thromboplastin time 45 seconds
Further evaluation is most likely to show which of the following?" (E) Impaired platelet-to-platelet aggregation (D) Deficiency of clotting factor II (B) Increased activity of protein S (A) Deficiency of clotting factor VIII (C) Increased serum anti-phospholipid antibodies
Reason: The symptoms and laboratory findings in this case suggest a bleeding disorder. The patient's low hemoglobin and signs of bruising, combined with the prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT), indicate a potential issue within the coagulation cascade. A deficiency of clotting factor II (prothrombin) would lead to prolongation of both PT and PTT and is consistent with the boy's clinical presentation of easy bruising and a possible underlying coagulopathy.
Answer: (D) Deficiency of clotting factor II

Question: A 78-year-old woman is brought to the emergency ward by her son for lethargy and generalized weakness. The patient speaks in short utterances and does not make eye contact with the provider or her son throughout the interview and examination. You elicit that the patient lives with her son and daughter-in-law, and she reports vague weakness for the last couple days. The emergency room provider notices 3-4 healing bruises on the patient's upper extremities; otherwise, examination is not revealing. Routine chemistries and blood counts are unremarkable; non-contrast head CT demonstrates normal age-related changes. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? (D) Ask the patient's son to leave the room (A) Perform lumbar puncture (C) Question the patient's son regarding the home situation (E) Call Adult Protective Services to report the patient's son (B) Question the patient regarding abuse or neglect
Reason: Asking the patient's son to leave the room is an important step in this scenario because it allows the healthcare provider to have a private conversation with the patient, which may help in obtaining more accurate and honest information about her situation. Given the signs of possible neglect or abuse indicated by the patient's lethargy, weakness, and unexplained bruises, ensuring confidentiality might enable the patient to speak freely about any potential issues at home that she may not feel comfortable disclosing in the presence of her son.
Answer: (D) Ask the patient's son to leave the room

Question: A 29-year-old G1P0 female at 32 weeks gestation presents to the emergency department with vaginal bleeding. She has had minimal prenatal care to-date with only an initial visit with an obstetrician after a positive home pregnancy test. She describes minimal spotting that she noticed earlier today that has progressed to larger amounts of blood; she estimates 30 mL of blood loss. She denies any cramping, pain, or contractions, and she reports feeling continued movements of the baby. Ultrasound and fetal heart rate monitoring confirm the presence of a healthy fetus without any evidence of current or impending complications. The consulted obstetrician orders blood testing for Rh-status of both the mother as well as the father, who brought the patient to the hospital. Which of the following represents the best management strategy for this situation? (A) If mother is Rh-negative and father is Rh-positive then administer RhoGAM (B) If mother is Rh-negative and father is Rh-negative then administer RhoGAM (E) After 28 weeks gestation, administration of RhoGAM will have no benefit (C) If mother is Rh-positive and father is Rh-negative then administer RhoGAM (D) If mother is Rh-negative and father is Rh-positive, RhoGAM administration is not needed
Reason: The administration of RhoGAM (Rh immunoglobulin) is essential in cases where an Rh-negative mother may be exposed to Rh-positive fetal blood, which could occur during vaginal bleeding or any such incident during pregnancy. If the mother is Rh-negative and the father is Rh-positive, there is a risk that the fetus may be Rh-positive, and administering RhoGAM helps prevent the development of Rh sensitization in the mother, thereby protecting future pregnancies from potential Rh incompatibility complications.
Answer: (A) If mother is Rh-negative and father is Rh-positive then administer RhoGAM

Question: A 35-year-old man and his 9-year-old son are brought to the emergency department following a high-speed motor vehicle collision. The father was the restrained driver. He is conscious. His pulse is 135/min and blood pressure is 76/55 mm Hg. His hemoglobin concentration is 5.9 g/dL. His son sustained multiple body contusions and loss of consciousness. He remains unresponsive in the emergency department. A focused assessment of the boy with sonography is concerning for multiple organ lacerations and internal bleeding. The physician decides to move the man's son to the operating room for emergency surgical exploration. The father says that he and his son are Jehovah's witnesses and do not want blood transfusions. The physician calls the boy's biological mother who confirms this religious belief. She also asks the physician to wait for her arrival before any other medical decisions are undertaken. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step for the physician? (B) Seek court order for medical treatment of the son (C) Transfuse packed red blood cells to both son and father (A) Transfuse packed red blood cells to son but not to father (E) Procede to surgery of the son without transfusion (D) Wait for the son's mother before providing further treatment
Reason: The answer is (A) Transfuse packed red blood cells to the son but not to the father because, in an emergency situation where a minor patient's life is at risk, medical professionals must prioritize the immediate needs of the child, particularly if they are in critical condition. While respecting the parents' religious beliefs regarding blood transfusion for the father is important, the presence of severe injuries and the potential for significant blood loss necessitate prompt action to save the son’s life, thus justifying the blood transfusion for him despite the parents' objections.
Answer: (A) Transfuse packed red blood cells to son but not to father

Which of the following is the most likely pathophysiology of these findings?" (B) Decreased spectrin in the RBC membrane (C) Deficient glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase (E) Deficiency of pyruvate kinase (A) Increased hemoglobin S (D) Decreased synthesis of alpha chains of hemoglobin
Reason: The answer is (B) Decreased spectrin in the RBC membrane, as the findings suggest a hereditary spherocytosis, which is a condition characterized by defects in the proteins of the red blood cell membrane, particularly spectrin. This defect leads to increased fragility and hemolysis of the red blood cells, which aligns with the symptoms of jaundice and splenomegaly observed in the child, as well as the laboratory results indicating anemia and elevated indirect bilirubin levels.
Answer: (B) Decreased spectrin in the RBC membrane

Question: An investigator is studying bone metabolism and compares the serum studies and bone biopsy findings of a cohort of women 25–35 years of age with those from a cohort of women 55–65 years of age. Which of the following processes is most likely to be increased in the cohort of older women? (D) Activation of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (E) Urinary excretion of osteocalcin (C) Urinary excretion of cyclic AMP (A) Expression of RANK ligand (B) Demineralization of bone with normal osteoid matrix
Reason: The answer is (A) Expression of RANK ligand, as RANK ligand (RANKL) plays a crucial role in the regulation of osteoclastogenesis, which is the process of bone resorption. In postmenopausal women, increased levels of estrogen deficiency lead to heightened expression of RANKL, resulting in increased osteoclast activity and, consequently, greater bone resorption, which is frequently observed as part of age-related bone metabolism changes.
Answer: (A) Expression of RANK ligand

Question: A 75-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of involuntary weight loss and a painless lump on her neck. Physical examination shows a firm, irregular swelling on the right side of the neck. Ultrasonography of the thyroid gland shows a 2-cm nodule with irregular margins and microcalcifications in the right thyroid lobe. A biopsy of the thyroid nodule is performed. Which of the following changes would be most consistent with anaplasia? (C) Reduced number of functional thyroid cells (B) Replacement of thyroid cells by normal squamous epithelium (A) Negative staining of tumor cells for thyroglobulin (E) Increased expression of thyroid transcription factor-1 (D) Disorganized proliferation of mature thyroid cells
Reason: The answer is (A) Negative staining of tumor cells for thyroglobulin because anaplasia, characterized by a loss of differentiation and function, often leads to tumor cells that do not express markers associated with their tissue of origin. In this case, a loss of thyroglobulin staining suggests that the thyroid cells have undergone anaplasia and have lost their functional properties.
Answer: (A) Negative staining of tumor cells for thyroglobulin

Question: A 13-year-old boy re-presents to his pediatrician with a new onset rash that began a few days after his initial visit. He initially presented with complaints of sore throat but was found to have a negative strep test. His mother demanded that he be placed on antibiotics, but this was refused by his pediatrician. The boy's father, a neurologist, therefore, started him on penicillin. Shortly after starting the drug, the boy developed a fever and a rash. The patient is admitted and his symptoms worsen. His skin begins to slough off, and the rash covers over 30% of his body. His oropharynx and corneal membranes are also affected. You examine him at the bedside and note a positive Nikolsky's sign. What is the most likely diagnosis? (D) Rocky Mounted Spotted Fever (A) Erythema Multiforme (C) Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (E) Pemphigus Vulgaris (B) Stevens-Johnson Syndrome
Reason: The answer is (C) Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN) because the boy's presentation of fever, widespread rash covering over 30% of the body, skin sloughing, and positive Nikolsky’s sign are all indicative of a severe drug reaction leading to extensive epidermal detachment. TEN is characterized by these symptoms and typically occurs in response to medications, particularly after the administration of antibiotics like penicillin.

Question: A 24-year-old male with cystic fibrosis is brought to the emergency room by his mother after he had difficulty breathing. He previously received a lung transplant 6 months ago and was able to recover quickly from the operation. He is compliant with all of his medications and had been doing well with no major complaints until 2 weeks ago when he began to experience shortness of breath. Exam reveals a decreased FEV1/FVC ratio and biopsy reveals lymphocytic infiltration. Which of the following components is present in the airway zone characteristically affected by the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms? (A) Cartilage (E) Stratified cuboidal cells (C) Pseudostratified columnar cells (B) Goblet cells (D) Simple cuboidal cells
Reason: The answer to the question is (D) Simple cuboidal cells because, in the context of lung transplant patients, the acute rejection process often involves the smaller airways, known as bronchioles. In these areas, the epithelial structure transitions from pseudostratified columnar cells found in the larger airways to simple cuboidal cells in the smaller airways, which can be indicative of injury and inflammation resulting from the rejection process.

Question: A 4-year-old male is evaluated for frequent epistaxis and mucous membrane bleeding. Physical examination shows diffuse petechiae on the patient’s distal extremities. Peripheral blood smear shows an absence of platelet clumping. An ELISA binding assay reveals that platelet surfaces are deficient in GIIb/IIIa receptors. Serum platelet count is normal. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? (D) Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (E) Glanzmann’s thrombasthenia (B) Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (A) Hemophilia A (C) Bernard-Soulier disease
Reason: The answer is (E) Glanzmann’s thrombasthenia because this condition is characterized by a deficiency in the GIIb/IIIa receptors on platelets, which are essential for platelet aggregation. The patient's symptoms of frequent epistaxis, mucous membrane bleeding, and the normal platelet count along with the peripheral blood smear findings align with this diagnosis, indicating a defect in the platelet function rather than a reduction in platelet quantity.

On otoscopic examination, there is granulation tissue at the transition between the cartilaginous and the osseous part of the ear canal. Which of the following is most likely associated with this patient's condition? (B) Condylar degeneration (D) Streptococcus pneumoniae (E) Elevated HBA1c (C) Opacified mastoid air cells (A) Malignant epithelial growth of the external auditory canal
Reason: The answer is (E) Elevated HBA1c because this patient's presentation is suggestive of necrotizing (malignant) otitis externa, a serious infection that often occurs in immunocompromised individuals, especially those with diabetes mellitus. The elevated HbA1c indicates poor glycemic control, which can contribute to a higher risk of infections, including severe ear infections like this one, particularly in a patient who is homeless and likely has limited access to medical care.
Answer: (E) Elevated HBA1c

Question: A 16-year-old female presents to the physician for delayed onset of menstruation. She reports that all of her friends have experienced their first menses, and she wonders whether “something is wrong with me.” The patient is a sophomore in high school and doing well in school. Her past medical history is significant for an episode of streptococcal pharyngitis six months ago, for which she was treated with oral amoxicillin. The patient is in the 35th percentile for weight and 5th percentile for height. On physical exam, her temperature is 98.7°F (37.1°C), blood pressure is 112/67 mmHg, pulse is 71/min, and respirations are 12/min. The patient has a short neck and wide torso. She has Tanner stage I beast development and pubic hair with normal external female genitalia. On bimanual exam, the vagina is of normal length and the cervix is palpable.

Which of the following is the most accurate test to diagnose this condition? (C) Serum FSH and LH levels (B) Karyotype analysis (A) Buccal smear for Barr bodies (D) Serum testosterone level (E) Serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone level
Reason: The most accurate test to diagnose the condition presented in the case is karyotype analysis because the patient exhibits signs that are suggestive of a possible chromosomal abnormality, particularly Turner syndrome, which commonly presents with delayed menstruation and lack of secondary sexual characteristics. A karyotype analysis would help determine the presence of an abnormal number of chromosomes or structural defects, which is crucial for diagnosis in cases of secondary amenorrhea in adolescents.

Question: Please refer to the summary above to answer this question
In the study, all participants who were enrolled and randomly assigned to treatment with pulmharkimab were analyzed in the pulmharkimab group regardless of medication nonadherence or refusal of allocated treatment. A medical student reading the abstract is confused about why some participants assigned to pulmharkimab who did not adhere to the regimen were still analyzed as part of the pulmharkimab group. Which of the following best reflects the purpose of such an analysis strategy?"
"Impact of pulmharkimab on asthma control and cardiovascular disease progression in patients with coronary artery disease and comorbid asthma
Introduction:
Active asthma has been found to be associated with a more than two-fold increase in the risk of myocardial infarction, even after adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors. It has been suggested that the inflammatory mediators and accelerated atherosclerosis characterizing systemic inflammation may increase the risk of both asthma and cardiovascular disease. This study evaluated the efficacy of the novel IL-1 inhibitor pulmharkimab in improving asthma and cardiovascular disease progression.
Methods:
In this double-blind, randomized controlled trial, patients (N=1200) with a history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction in the past 2 years, and a diagnosis of comorbid adult-onset asthma were recruited from cardiology clinics at a large academic medical center in Philadelphia, PA. Patients who were immunocompromised or had a history of recurrent infections were excluded.
Patients were subsequently randomly assigned a 12-month course of pulmharkimab 75 mg/day, pulmharkimab 150 mg/day, or a placebo, with each group containing 400 participants. All participants were included in analysis and analyzed in the groups to which they were randomized regardless of medication adherence. Variables measured included plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) scores, which quantified the severity of asthma symptoms. Plaque volume was determined by ultrasound.
Analyses were performed from baseline to month 12.
Results:
At baseline, participants in the two groups did not differ by age, gender, race, plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and ACQ scores (p > 0.05 for all). A total of 215 participants (18%) were lost to follow-up. At 12-month follow-up, the groups contained the following numbers of participants:
Pulmharkimab 75 mg/d: 388 participants
Pulmharkimab 150 mg/d: 202 participants
Placebo: 395 participants
Table 1: Association between pulmharkimab and both pulmonary and cardiovascular outcomes. Models were adjusted for sociodemographic variables and medical comorbidities. All outcome variables were approximately normally distributed.
Pulmharkimab 75 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Pulmharkimab 150 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Placebo, (Mean +/- 2 SE) P-value
Plaque volume (mm3), change from baseline 6.6 ± 2.8 1.2 ± 4.7 15.8 ± 2.9 < 0.01
LDL-C levels, change from baseline -9.4 ± 3.6 -11.2 ± 14.3 -8.4 ± 3.9 0.28
FEV1/FVC ratio, change from baseline 0.29 ± 2.21 0.34 ± 5.54 -0.22 ± 3.21 0.27
ACQ scores, change from baseline 0.31 ± 1.22 0.46 ± 3.25 0.12 ± 1.33 0.43
Conclusion:
Pulmharkimab may be effective in reducing plaque volume but does not lead to improved asthma control in patients with a history of myocardial infarction and comorbid asthma.

Question: A 52-year-old man is seen by his endocrinologist for routine followup of his type 2 diabetes. Although he has previously been on a number of medication regimens, his A1C has remained significantly elevated. In order to try to better control his glucose level, the endocrinologist prescribes a new medication. He explains that this new medication works by blocking the ability of his kidneys to reabsorb glucose and therefore causes glucose wasting in the urine. Which of the following medications has this mechanism of action? (C) Exenatide (B) Canagliflozin (D) Glyburide (A) Acarbose (E) Metformin
Reason: Canagliflozin is classified as a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, which specifically works by preventing the kidneys from reabsorbing glucose, leading to increased glucose excretion in the urine. This mechanism effectively helps lower blood glucose levels in patients with type 2 diabetes, making it a suitable option for managing elevated A1C levels in this patient.
Answer: (B) Canagliflozin

Question: A 6-year-old boy is brought to the office by his mother. She reports that her son is well but has some concerns about his overall health: he is shorter and, physically, seems less developed compared to his siblings when they were the same age. He recently started school and the mother reports that the boy’s teachers are concerned with his learning capability. His height and weight are in the 10th and 15th percentiles, respectively. Lab results reveal:
Hemoglobin 10 gm/dL
Mean corpuscular volume 110 fL
Multi-segmented neutrophils are seen on peripheral blood smear. Urinary orotic acid levels are found to be high. What is the most likely cause of this patient’s condition? (C) Inhibition of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase II (B) Overactivity of uridine monophosphate synthase (E) Deficiency of cobalamin (A) Deficiency of uridine monophosphate synthase (D) Activation of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase
Reason: The answer is (A) Deficiency of uridine monophosphate synthase. This condition, also known as orotic aciduria, is characterized by the accumulation of orotic acid due to impaired pyrimidine synthesis, resulting from a deficiency in uridine monophosphate synthase. The clinical presentation of growth failure, developmental delays, macrocytic anemia (evidenced by high mean corpuscular volume), and high orotic acid levels supports this diagnosis, as these manifest in the context of impaired nucleotide synthesis and cellular growth.
Answer: (A) Deficiency of uridine monophosphate synthase

Question: A 78-year-old woman is brought to the physician by her son because of progressive memory loss for the past year. She feels tired and can no longer concentrate on her morning crossword puzzles. She has gained 11.3 kg (25 lb) in the last year. Her father died from complications of Alzheimer disease. She has a history of drinking alcohol excessively but has not consumed alcohol for the past 10 years. Vital signs are within normal limits. She is oriented but has short-term memory deficits. Examination shows a normal gait and delayed relaxation of the achilles reflex bilaterally. Her skin is dry and she has brittle nails. Which of the following is the most likely underlying etiology of this woman’s memory loss? (E) Alzheimer disease (A) Thiamine deficiency (D) Vitamin B12 deficiency (C) Normal pressure hydrocephalus (B) Autoimmune thyroid disease
Reason: The answer is (B) Autoimmune thyroid disease. This woman's symptoms of progressive memory loss, fatigue, weight gain, and changes in her skin and nails suggest a possible hypothyroid state, which is often associated with autoimmune thyroid conditions such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Cognitive impairment and memory issues can occur due to low thyroid hormone levels; thus, it is plausible that autoimmune thyroid disease is the underlying etiology of her memory loss, especially given her age and the presence of other symptoms indicative of hypothyroidism.

They resolve spontaneously and reappear at another location a few days later. Over the past 6 months, has had multiple episodes of diarrhea. She has lost 8 kg weight over this period and feels tired constantly. She has not had fever. She was treated for deep venous thrombosis 3 years ago, and took medication for it for 6 months after the episode. Her vital signs are within normal limits. She appears pale and has multiple, tender, ulcerative skin lesions on her legs and buttocks. Her hemoglobin is 9.6 mg/dL, mean corpuscular volume is 82 μm3, and fingerstick blood glucose concentration is 154 mg/dL. Her serum glucagon is elevated. Abdominal ultrasonography reveals a 5.6 cm, well-demarcated, hypoechoic mass in the pancreatic body and multiple, small masses in the liver of variable echogenicity.

Question: A 64-year-old male retired farmer presents to the orthopaedic surgery clinic with chronic left knee pain. Radiographic imaging demonstrates severe tricompartmental osteoarthritis. The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and congestive heart failure. He undergoes a left knee replacement without complications. A Foley catheter was placed in the operating room and removed in the post-anesthesia care unit. He receives subcutaneous heparin and has sequential compression devices in place to prevent deep venous thromboses. On post-operative day 1, he develops suprapubic pain and dysuria and is subsequently found to have a urinary tract infection. He is discharged on post-operative day 2 with an appropriate antibiotic regimen. However, he presents to the emergency room on post-operative day 6 with severe left leg pain. Venous dopplers demonstrate an occlusive thrombus in the popliteal vein. He is readmitted for anticoagulation and monitoring. A quality improvement team in the hospital estimates that the probability of getting both a urinary tract infection and a deep venous thrombosis is 0.00008 in patients undergoing routine total knee replacement. Furthermore, they estimate that the probability of getting a urinary tract infection in a similar patient population is 0.04. Assuming that the development of urinary tract infections and deep venous thromboses are independent, what is the risk of developing a deep venous thrombosis following total knee replacement? (A) 0.02 (D) 0.00002 (C) 0.0002 (E) Cannot be determined (B) 0.002
Reason: To determine the risk of developing a deep venous thrombosis (DVT) following total knee replacement, we apply the concept of independent probabilities. The probability of developing both a urinary tract infection (UTI) and a DVT is provided as 0.00008, while the probability of developing a UTI is given as 0.04. By using the formula for independent events \( P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B) \), we can solve for \( P(B) \) (the risk of DVT): 

\[ 0.00008 = 0.04 \times P(B) \]
\[ P(B) = \frac{0.00008}{0.04} = 0.002 \]

This confirms that the risk of developing a DVT following total knee replacement is 0.002, which aligns with the answer choice (B).

Question: A 61-year-old male presents to an urgent care clinic with the complaints of pain in his joints and recurrent headaches for a month. He is also currently concerned about sweating excessively even at room temperature. His wife, who is accompanying him, adds that his facial appearance has changed over the past few years as he now has a protruding jaw and a prominent forehead and brow ridge. His wedding ring no longer fits his finger despite a lack of weight gain over the last decade. His temperature is 98.6° F (37° C), respirations are 15/min, pulse is 67/min and blood pressure is 122/88 mm Hg. A general physical exam does not show any abnormality. What lab findings are most likely to be seen in this patient? (E) Low insulin levels (A) Elevated TSH and low FT4 (C) Elevated prolactin levels (B) Elevated cortisol level (D) Elevated insulin-like growth factor (IGF1) and growth hormone (GH)
Reason: The patient's symptoms, including joint pain, recurrent headaches, excessive sweating, and distinctive facial changes such as a protruding jaw and prominent brow ridge, suggest acromegaly, which is often due to excess growth hormone (GH) usually caused by a growth hormone-secreting pituitary adenoma. In this condition, elevated levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) are commonly seen as IGF-1 is stimulated by GH, making answer choice (D) the most appropriate lab finding in this case.
Answer: (D) Elevated insulin-like growth factor (IGF1) and growth hormone (GH)
[INFO] Sampling path 10 completed.
[INFO] Opinion paths:
Path 1: Let's analyze the question step by step. The patient's symptoms include hip and back pain, with pain that radiates down the leg and has an "electrical" quality. This presentation is suggestive of radiculopathy, possibly due to a herniated disc or some form of nerve impingement. 

To confirm the diagnosis of radiculopathy, the most useful clinical test in this scenario would be the straight leg raise test (C). This test is performed by having the patient lie supine and then raising each leg while keeping the knee straight. If the patient experiences pain radiating down the leg during this maneuver, it is indicative of nerve root irritation, commonly associated with lumbar disc herniation.

Thus, the most likely option to help confirm the diagnosis in this patient is:

Answer: (C) Straight leg raise.
Path 2: Let's think step by step.

The patient's symptoms of lower back pain, buttock pain, and pain that travels down the leg, described as "electrical," are suggestive of possible lumbar radiculopathy, which can be due to a herniated disc or other spinal issues affecting the nerve roots.

To confirm the diagnosis of lumbar radiculopathy, the **Straight Leg Raise (C)** test is commonly used. This test evaluates for nerve root irritation or compression, particularly the L4-S1 nerve roots. A positive straight leg raise test occurs when the patient experiences pain radiating down the leg as the leg is raised, which would be consistent with radiculopathy.

While other options may provide information about hip joint function or musculoskeletal issues, the straight leg raise test is specifically aimed at assessing nerve root involvement related to the symptoms described.

So, the most likely option to help confirm the diagnosis is:
**Answer: (C) Straight leg raise**.
Path 3: Let's analyze the scenario step by step.

The patient is a 69-year-old man presenting with hip and back pain that radiates into his leg, described as "electrical." This presentation, along with his history of lifting a heavy object leading to sudden onset of pain, raises suspicion for a lumbar radiculopathy, likely due to a herniated disc or spinal stenosis affecting the nerve roots.

In this context, the **straight leg raise (C)** test is a common clinical maneuver used to assess for nerve root irritation or compression, particularly involving the L4-S1 nerve roots, which can cause radiating pain down the leg. This test is specifically designed to reproduce radicular pain, which aligns with the patient's description of pain traveling down his leg.

Given this reasoning, the option most likely to help confirm the diagnosis of lumbar radiculopathy is:

**Answer: (C) Straight leg raise**
Path 4: Let's analyze the situation step by step.

The patient is a 69-year-old man experiencing hip and back pain, which is exacerbated by lifting a heavy object. He describes the pain as electrical and radiating down his leg, which suggests a possible nerve root involvement, such as in sciatica or lumbar radiculopathy. 

In this context, the straight leg raise (SLR) test is a physical examination maneuver used to assess for lumbar nerve root irritation or herniated discs. A positive SLR test occurs when raising the leg elicits pain down the leg, indicating nerve root irritation.

Now, let's consider the options:

(A) Palpating the paraspinus muscle - This would assess for muscle tenderness but is not specific for nerve involvement.
(B) Flexion, abduction, and external rotation of the thigh - This tests hip joint movement but does not specifically assess nerve root issues.
(C) Straight leg raise - This is a classic maneuver to assess for lumbar radiculopathy.
(D) Internal rotation of the extended hip - This tests hip joint motion and may indicate hip pathology but not nerve root involvement.
(E) Radiography - While imaging can confirm certain diagnoses, it is not the first step in confirming nerve root irritation.

Based on this analysis, the most appropriate option to help confirm the diagnosis of possible lumbar radiculopathy is:

**Answer: (C) Straight leg raise.**
Path 5: Let's analyze the details step by step.

The patient's presentation indicates a potential issue related to the lumbar spine, as he has hip and back pain that radiates down his leg, which suggests possible nerve involvement, such as sciatica. The description of the pain feeling "electrical" is also consistent with nerve irritation or compression.

To confirm a diagnosis related to potential lumbar radiculopathy or herniated disc, the **straight leg raise test (C)** is commonly used. This test assesses for nerve root irritation, particularly the S1 or L5 nerve roots, which could be responsible for the symptoms described.

Now, let’s evaluate the options:

- **(B)** Flexion, abduction, and external rotation of the thigh - This maneuver is more relevant for assessing hip joint pathology.
- **(D)** Internal rotation of the extended hip - This is also primarily for hip pathology.
- **(E)** Radiography - While imaging can help, it is not a direct confirmatory test for nerve root involvement.
- **(C)** Straight leg raise - This test is specifically used to evaluate for radiculopathy and is likely to help confirm the diagnosis.
- **(A)** Palpating the paraspinus muscle - This may help assess for muscle spasm but does not confirm nerve root involvement.

Given this analysis, the most appropriate answer is:

**Answer: (C) Straight leg raise**
Path 6: To determine the most likely option that will help confirm the diagnosis for this patient, let's analyze the symptoms and the options provided.

The patient is a 69-year-old man with hip and back pain that is described as "electrical" and radiating down his leg, which raises suspicion for a possible lumbar radiculopathy or sciatica, potentially due to a herniated disc or spinal stenosis.

Now, let's evaluate the options:

(A) Palpating the paraspinus muscle - This would primarily help assess for muscle tenderness or spasm but is not definitive for diagnosing nerve root involvement.

(B) Flexion, abduction, and external rotation of the thigh - This is more relevant for hip joint pathology.

(C) Straight leg raise - This test is commonly used to assess for nerve root irritation or herniated discs. A positive straight leg raise test (pain radiating down the leg when the leg is lifted) can indicate nerve root involvement.

(D) Internal rotation of the extended hip - This test is more focused on hip joint pathology and does not help in diagnosing radiculopathy.

(E) Radiography - While radiographs can provide information about the anatomy of the spine, they may not effectively confirm a diagnosis of nerve root involvement.

Given the patient’s symptoms of buttock pain radiating down the leg and the description of "electrical" pain, the most relevant test to confirm a diagnosis of lumbar radiculopathy would be:

**Answer: (C) Straight leg raise**
Path 7: Let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. **Patient's Symptoms**: The patient is experiencing hip and back pain, which he describes as electrical and sometimes radiating down his leg. This suggests possible nerve involvement, commonly seen in conditions like herniated discs or sciatica.

2. **Mechanism of Injury**: The onset of pain occurred after lifting a heavy object, which can lead to a lumbar disc herniation or other spine-related issues.

3. **Radiating Pain**: The fact that the pain travels down the leg is particularly indicative of radicular pain, which is often associated with nerve root compression.

4. **Physical Examination Tests**: The straight leg raise (SLR) test is a common physical examination maneuver used to assess for nerve root irritation or compression originating from the lumbar spine. A positive SLR test (pain radiating down the leg when the leg is raised) is often indicative of a herniated disc affecting the L4-S1 nerve roots.

5. **Other Options**:
   - Flexion, abduction, and external rotation of the thigh could assess hip joint issues but would not specifically confirm a lumbar disc issue.
   - Internal rotation of the extended hip is more related to hip joint pathology.
   - Radiography (X-rays) can show structural issues in the spine but may not specifically confirm nerve root involvement without further imaging (like MRI) or clinical signs.
   - Palpating the paraspinus muscle might reveal muscle tenderness but won't confirm nerve involvement.

Given this analysis, the most appropriate and likely test to help confirm the diagnosis of a potential lumbar disc herniation or radiculopathy is:

**Answer: (C) Straight leg raise**
Path 8: Let's analyze the case step by step. 

The patient is a 69-year-old man who presents with hip and back pain, along with symptoms that radiate down his leg and describe an "electrical" sensation. This presentation raises suspicion for sciatica, which is often caused by nerve root compression, commonly due to a herniated disc or spinal stenosis.

Among the options provided:

- (A) Palpating the paraspinal muscle may help assess for muscle issues but is not definitive for diagnosing nerve involvement.
- (B) Flexion, abduction, and external rotation of the thigh might assess the hip joint but won't specifically confirm nerve root issues.
- (C) Straight leg raise test is commonly used to assess for nerve root irritation or compression associated with sciatica. A positive straight leg raise indicates that raising the leg reproduces the patient's pain down the leg, which would support a diagnosis of nerve involvement.
- (D) Internal rotation of the extended hip is typically not used for diagnosing back or leg pain related to nerve issues.
- (E) Radiography (X-rays) can rule out fractures or other structural issues but is not as specific as the straight leg raise test for confirming nerve root involvement.

Given this analysis, the most likely test to help confirm the diagnosis of sciatica due to nerve root irritation is the **straight leg raise test**.

Therefore, the answer is: (C) Straight leg raise.
Path 9: Let's analyze the question step by step.

The patient is presenting with lower back pain that radiates into his buttocks and down his leg, described as "electrical." This symptomatology is suggestive of radicular pain, which is often associated with conditions like a herniated disc or lumbar radiculopathy.

**Options Analysis:**
- **(B) Flexion, abduction, and external rotation of the thigh** - This test is typically used to assess hip joint problems, not specifically for radicular pain.
  
- **(D) Internal rotation of the extended hip** - This maneuver can also assess hip joint pathology but is not specific for lumbar radiculopathy.
  
- **(E) Radiography** - While X-rays can evaluate for structural issues, they may not provide the best confirmation for radiculopathy or disc herniation.
  
- **(C) Straight leg raise** - This test is specifically used to assess for lumbar radiculopathy. A positive straight leg raise test indicates that raising the leg causes pain that radiates down the leg, which is consistent with nerve root irritation.
  
- **(A) Palpating the paraspinal muscle** - This would assess for muscle tension or spasm but is not a definitive test for radiculopathy.

Given the patient's symptoms and the nature of the tests, the **most likely option to help confirm the diagnosis** of radiculopathy is:

**Answer: (C) Straight leg raise**.
Path 10: Let's think through the scenario step by step. The patient is a 69-year-old man with hip and back pain, and he describes the pain as "electrical," which suggests possible nerve involvement. The pain radiating down his leg could indicate sciatica or lumbar radiculopathy, often associated with lumbar disc issues or nerve root compression.

To confirm a diagnosis related to nerve root irritation, the straight leg raise test is commonly used. This test involves raising the leg while the patient is lying down, and if it reproduces the leg pain, it suggests a herniated disc or nerve root irritation.

Other options provided:
- (B) Flexion, abduction, and external rotation of the thigh is related to hip joint assessment.
- (D) Internal rotation of the extended hip is also related to hip function.
- (E) Radiography can help visualize bone issues but is not as definitive for soft tissue or nerve root issues.
- (A) Palpating the paraspinal muscle may indicate muscle pain but won't confirm a nerve-related issue.

Given this information, the most likely test to help confirm the diagnosis of potential nerve involvement is:

Answer: (C) Straight leg raise.

Question: A 52-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 3-week history of pain in her right knee. The pain is worse at the end of the day and when she walks. She says that it has become difficult for her to walk up the flight of stairs to reach her apartment. She has hypertension and psoriasis. Her sister has rheumatoid arthritis. She drinks 2–3 beers daily. Current medications include hydrochlorothiazide, topical betamethasone, and a multivitamin. She is 160 cm (5 ft 3 in) tall and weighs 92 kg (202 lb); BMI is 36 kg/m2. She appears anxious. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 87/min, and blood pressure is 135/83 mm Hg. Cardiopulmonary examinations shows no abnormalities. There are several scaly plaques over the patient's upper and lower extremities. The right knee is not tender nor erythematous; range of motion is limited. Crepitus is heard on flexion and extension of the knee. Her hemoglobin concentration is 12.6 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,000/mm3, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate is 16 mm/h. An x-ray of the right knee is shown. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient? (C) Total joint replacement (E) Colchicine therapy (D) Methotrexate therapy (A) Intraarticular glucocorticoid injections (B) Weight loss program
Reason: A weight loss program is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient because obesity is a significant contributing factor to her knee pain, particularly in the context of osteoarthritis, which is suggested by the symptoms of pain, limited range of motion, and crepitus in the knee. Weight loss can alleviate stress on the joints, potentially reducing pain and improving mobility, while also positively impacting her overall health and comorbidities such as hypertension.

Question: A study on cholesterol levels is performed. There are 1000 participants. It is determined that in this population, the mean LDL is 200 mg/dL with a standard deviation of 50 mg/dL. If the population has a normal distribution, how many people have a cholesterol less than 300 mg/dL? (D) 975 (C) 950 (B) 840 (A) 680 (E) 997
Reason: The answer is (D) 975 because, in a normal distribution, we can use the properties of the distribution to calculate the percentage of the population that falls below a certain threshold. Given that the mean LDL is 200 mg/dL and the standard deviation is 50 mg/dL, a cholesterol level of 300 mg/dL is 2 standard deviations above the mean. According to the empirical rule, approximately 95% of data falls within 2 standard deviations from the mean in a normal distribution, meaning about 97.5% of the population will have LDL levels below 300 mg/dL, which corresponds to roughly 975 people out of 1000.

Question: A young immigrant girl presents with low-grade fever, sore throat, painful swallowing, and difficulty in breathing. Her voice is unusually nasal and her swollen neck gives the impression of “bull's neck”. On examination, a large gray membrane is noticed on the oropharynx as shown in the picture. Removal of the membrane reveals a bleeding edematous mucosa. Culture on potassium tellurite medium reveals several black colonies. What is the mechanism of action of the bacterial toxin responsible for this condition? (B) Spreads to peripheral cholinergic nerve terminals and blocks the release of acetylcholine  (D) ADP ribosylates EF-2 and prevents protein synthesis (ADP = adenosine diphosphate; EF-2 = elongation factor-2) (C) Cytotoxic to cells (E) Causes muscle cell necrosis (A) Travels retrogradely on axons of peripheral motor neurons and blocks the release of inhibitory neurotransmitters
Reason: The condition described in the question is consistent with diphtheria, which is caused by the bacterium Corynebacterium diphtheriae. The toxin produced by this bacterium works by ADP ribosylating elongation factor-2 (EF-2), which inhibits protein synthesis in cells, leading to cell death and the characteristic symptoms of the disease.
Answer: (D) ADP ribosylates EF-2 and prevents protein synthesis (ADP = adenosine diphosphate; EF-2 = elongation factor-2)

Question: A 15-year-old girl is hospitalized because of increased fatigue and weight loss over the past 2 months. The patient has no personal or family history of a serious illness. She takes no medications, currently. Her blood pressure is 175/74 mm Hg on the left arm and 90/45 on the right. The radial pulse is 84/min but weaker on the right side. The femoral blood pressure and pulses show no abnormalities. Temperature is 38.1℃ (100.6℉). The muscles over the right upper arm are slightly atrophic. The remainder of the examination reveals no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show the following results:
Hemoglobin 10.4 g/dL
Leukocyte count 5,000/mm3
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate 58 mm/h
Magnetic resonance arteriography reveals irregularity, stenosis, and poststenotic dilation involving the proximal right subclavian artery. Prednisone is initiated with improvement of her symptoms. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the patient management? (D) Rituximab (E) Surgery (A) Carvedilol + hydrochlorothiazide (B) Cyclophosphamide (C) Plasmapheresis
Reason: The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of a large vessel vasculitis, likely affecting the subclavian artery, as indicated by her hypertension and arm atrophy, combined with elevated ESR suggesting an inflammatory process. In this case, managing her hypertension and addressing the vascular complications with antihypertensive medication (such as carvedilol and hydrochlorothiazide) is appropriate as it can help control blood pressure and treat any potential heart strain resulting from the altered hemodynamics.

Question: An investigator is comparing DNA replication in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. He finds that the entire genome of E. coli (4 × 106 base pairs) is replicated in approximately 30 minutes. A mammalian genome (3 × 109 base pairs) is usually replicated within 3 hours. Which of the following characteristics of eukaryotic DNA replication is the most accurate explanation for this finding? (D) DNA compaction in chromatin (C) Simultaneous replication at multiple origins (A) Absence of telomerase enzyme activity (B) Replication inhibition at checkpoint (E) More efficient DNA polymerase activity
Reason: Reasoning: Eukaryotic DNA replication is characterized by the presence of multiple origins of replication along each chromosome, allowing for the simultaneous initiation of replication at various points. This feature enables mammalian cells to manage their larger genomes efficiently, even though the overall replication process takes longer compared to the relatively compact genome of prokaryotes like E. coli, which typically has a single origin of replication.

Question: A 15-year-old boy is brought to the Emergency department by ambulance from school. He started the day with some body aches and joint pain but then had several episodes of vomiting and started complaining of a terrible headache. The school nurse called for emergency services. The boy was born at 39 weeks gestation via spontaneous vaginal delivery. He is up to date on all vaccines and is meeting all developmental milestones. Past medical history is noncontributory. He is a good student and enjoys sports. At the hospital, his blood pressure is 120/80 mm Hg, heart rate is 105/min, respiratory rate is 21/min, and his temperature is 38.9°C (102.0°F). On physical exam, he appears drowsy with neck stiffness and sensitivity to light. Kernig’s sign is positive. An ophthalmic exam is performed followed by a lumbar puncture. An aliquot of cerebrospinal fluid is sent to microbiology. A gram stain shows gram-negative diplococci. A smear is prepared on blood agar and grows round, smooth, convex colonies with clearly defined edges. Which of the following would identify the described pathogen? (D) Oxidase-positive and ferments glucose and maltose (E) Oxidase-positive test and ferments glucose only (A) Growth in anaerobic conditions (C) Growth in colonies (B) No growth on Thayer-Martin medium
Reason: The symptoms presented, including drowsiness, neck stiffness, sensitivity to light, and the presence of gram-negative diplococci in the cerebrospinal fluid, suggest a diagnosis of meningitis, specifically caused by Neisseria meningitidis. This organism is known to be oxidase-positive and ferments both glucose and maltose, which aligns with option (D). The specific growth characteristics on culture media help further confirm this identification.

Question: A 9-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his mother because of painful swelling in his right knee that started after he collided with another player during a soccer game. He has no history of serious illness except for an episode of prolonged bleeding following a tooth extraction a few months ago. Physical examination shows marked tenderness and swelling of the right knee joint. There are multiple bruises on the lower extremities in various stages of healing. Laboratory studies show a platelet count of 235,000/mm3, partial thromboplastin time of 78 seconds, prothrombin time of 14 seconds, and bleeding time of 4 minutes. The plasma concentration of which of the following is most likely to be decreased in this patient? (C) Thrombin (B) Plasmin (E) Factor VII (A) Protein C (D) Von Willebrand factor
Reason: The patient in this scenario has prolonged bleeding time and an elevated partial thromboplastin time (PTT), which suggests a bleeding disorder. Since thrombin plays a crucial role in the coagulation cascade, a decrease in its concentration could lead to inadequate conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin, thereby contributing to his bleeding tendencies observed during the soccer game and following dental work.

Question: A 9-year-old boy is brought to the clinic by his parents for an annual wellness examination. He is a relatively healthy boy who was born at term via vaginal delivery. He is meeting his developmental milestones and growth curves and is up-to-date on his immunizations. The father complains that he is picky with his food and would rather eat pizza. The patient denies any trouble at school, fevers, pain, or other concerns. A physical examination demonstrates a healthy boy with a grade 3 midsystolic ejection murmur at the second intercostal space that does not disappear when he sits up. What is the most likely explanation for this patient’s findings? (A) Defect of the septum secundum (D) Physiologic conditions outside the heart (C) Inflammation of the visceral and parietal pericardium (E) Prolonged patency of the ductus arteriosus (B) Failure of the septum primum to fuse with the endocardial cushions
Reason: The presence of a grade 3 midsystolic ejection murmur in a healthy 9-year-old boy, particularly one that doesn't disappear when he sits up, suggests a structural heart condition rather than a physiological murmur. A defect of the septum secundum, which is an atrial septal defect, can lead to increased blood flow across the right side of the heart, causing a characteristic murmur due to increased blood flow through the pulmonary outflow tract. Therefore, this structural defect is the most plausible explanation for the findings in this patient.

Question: A 72-year-old man comes to the physician for a 5-month history of hoarseness, exertional dyspnea, and fatigue. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His pulse is 98/min and irregular. His voice is coarse in quality. Physical examination shows a liver span of 16 cm and a soft diastolic murmur heard best at the apex. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's hoarseness? (A) Carcinoma arising from the mucosa of the larynx (C) Bacterial infection of the vocal folds (E) Circulating acetylcholine receptor antibodies
" (D) Laryngeal inflammation due to chemical irritant (B) Extrinsic impingement of the recurrent laryngeal nerve
Reason: The most likely cause of this patient's hoarseness is (B) Extrinsic impingement of the recurrent laryngeal nerve. The combination of his age, symptoms (hoarseness, dyspnea, and fatigue), irregular pulse, enlarged liver, and diastolic murmur suggests possible cardiac issues that might lead to enlargement of nearby structures, potentially affecting the recurrent laryngeal nerve. This nerve innervates the muscles of the larynx, and any external pressure or impingement could lead to vocal changes such as hoarseness.

Question: A 69-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 4-month history of progressive fatigue, cough, shortness of breath, and a 6.6-kg (14.5-lb) weight loss. For the past week, he has had blood-tinged sputum. He is a retired demolition foreman. There is dullness to percussion and decreased breath sounds over the left lung base. A CT scan of the chest shows a left-sided pleural effusion and circumferential pleural thickening with calcifications on the left hemithorax. Pathologic examination of a biopsy specimen of the thickened tissue is most likely to show which of the following findings? (A) Synaptophysin-positive dark blue cells with hyperchromatic nuclei and scarce cytoplasm (C) Napsin-positive cells in an acinar growth pattern with intracytoplasmatic mucin (E) Large polygonal cells with prominent nucleoli and abundant pale cytoplasm (D) Keratin-producing large polygonal cells with intercellular bridges (B) Calretinin-positive polygonal cells with numerous long surface microvilli
Reason: The most likely findings in the biopsy specimen from the thickened pleural tissue are (B) Calretinin-positive polygonal cells with numerous long surface microvilli. Given the patient's occupational history as a demolition foreman, he is at increased risk for asbestos exposure, which is associated with mesothelioma—a type of cancer that typically arises in the pleura. The presence of Calretinin-positive cells with microvilli is a characteristic histopathological finding in mesothelioma, supporting this diagnosis.

Question: A Caucasian 32-year-old woman has an uncomplicated vaginal delivery, giving birth to male and female fraternal twins at term. At 2 days of life, the twin sister develops abdominal distension without emesis, and the mother states that she has not noticed the passage of stool for this infant. Genetic testing identifies deletion of an amino acid in a membrane channel for the girl. Both parents are healthy. Assuming that twin brother's disease status/symptomatology is unclear, which of the following best approximates the probability that the twin brother is a carrier of the disease allele? (D) 67% (C) 50% (B) 25% (A) 0% (E) 100%
Reason: The probability that the twin brother is a carrier of the disease allele is best approximated as (C) 50%. Since the genetic testing indicates a deletion of an amino acid in a membrane channel affecting the female twin, and both parents are healthy (indicating they are likely carriers of a recessive trait), there is a 1 in 2 chance that the male twin inherited the carrier allele from one of the parents, given that he is genetically related to his sister but has not been clinically evaluated for the condition.

She describes her headaches as throbbing, mostly on her forehead, and severe enough to affect her daily activities. She has not experienced menarche. Past medical history is noncontributory. She takes no medication. Both of her parents are alive and well. Today, her blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg, the heart rate is 90/min, the respiratory rate is 17/min, and the temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F). Breasts and pubic hair development are in Tanner stage I. Blood work is collected and an MRI is performed (the result is shown). Inhibition of which of the following hormones is the most likely explanation for the patient's signs and symptoms? (B) Thyroid-stimulating hormone (E) Prolactin (C) Gonadotropins (A) Antidiuretic hormone (D) Adrenocorticotropic hormone
Reason: The answer (C) Gonadotropins is supported by the clinical presentation of the teenager, who is experiencing headaches, loss of vision, and has not started menstruating (amenorrhea), all of which may suggest a disruption in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. Given her Tanner stage I development, the inhibition of gonadotropins is likely leading to impaired ovarian function, resulting in the absence of secondary sexual characteristics and menstrual cycles. The headaches and visual symptoms could indicate increased intracranial pressure from a potential mass effect affecting the pituitary gland responsible for gonadotropin secretion.

Question: A 19-year-old woman with a history of poorly controlled asthma presents to her pulmonologist for a follow-up visit. She was recently hospitalized for an asthma exacerbation. It is her third hospitalization in the past five years. She currently takes inhaled salmeterol and medium-dose inhaled budesonide. Her past medical history is also notable for psoriasis. She does not smoke and does not drink alcohol. Her temperature is 98.6°F (37°C), blood pressure is 110/65 mmHg, pulse is 75/min, and respirations are 20/min. Physical examination reveals bilateral wheezes that are loudest at the bases. The patient’s physician decides to start the patient on zileuton. Which of the following is the most immediate downstream effect of initiating zileuton? (C) Decreased IgE-mediated pro-inflammatory activity (A) Decreased production of leukotrienes (E) Decreased signaling via the muscarinic receptor (B) Decreased signaling via the leukotriene receptor (D) Decreased mast cell degranulation
Reason: The answer (A) Decreased production of leukotrienes is supported by the mechanism of action of zileuton, which is a leukotriene synthesis inhibitor. By inhibiting the enzyme lipoxygenase, zileuton effectively decreases the production of leukotrienes, which are involved in the inflammatory response and bronchoconstriction associated with asthma. Therefore, initiating zileuton treatment would lead to a reduction in the synthesis of these pro-inflammatory mediators, addressing the patient's asthma exacerbations.
Answer: (A) Decreased production of leukotrienes

Question: A 36-year-old woman comes to the physician because of an 8-month history of occasional tremor. The tremor is accompanied by sudden restlessness and nausea, which disrupts her daily work as a professional violinist. The symptoms worsen shortly before upcoming concerts but also appear when she goes for a walk in the city. She is concerned that she might have a neurological illness and have to give up her career. The patient experiences difficulty falling asleep because she cannot stop worrying that a burglar might break into her house. Her appetite is good. She drinks one glass of wine before performances ""to calm her nerves"" and otherwise drinks 2–3 glasses of wine per week. The patient takes daily multivitamins as prescribed. She appears nervous. Her temperature is 36.8°C (98.2°F), pulse is 92/min, and blood pressure is 135/80 mm Hg. Mental status examination shows a full range of affect. On examination, a fine tremor on both hands is noted. She exhibits muscle tension. The remainder of the neurological exam shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this patient's symptoms?" (D) Panic disorder (E) Atypical depressive disorder (C) Adjustment disorder (A) Generalized anxiety disorder (B) Essential tremor
Reason: The answer (A) Generalized anxiety disorder is supported by the patient's symptoms, which include persistent worry, restlessness, difficulty sleeping, and physical manifestations such as tremors—all hallmarks of anxiety disorders. The fact that her symptoms occur during stressful situations, like concerts and being in public, aligns with the characteristics of generalized anxiety disorder, where anxiety is not limited to specific situations but is more pervasive and affects various aspects of daily life. Additionally, her reliance on alcohol to manage her anxiety suggests an attempt to cope with her underlying anxiety disorder.
Answer: (A) Generalized anxiety disorder

Question: A 4-year-old boy is brought to the pediatrician with fever, diarrhea and bilateral red eye for 7 days. His parents noted that he has never had an episode of diarrhea this prolonged, but several other children at daycare had been ill. His immunization history is up to date. His vitals are normal except for a temperature of 37.5°C (99°F). A physical exam is significant for mild dehydration, preauricular adenopathy, and bilateral conjunctival injection with watery discharge. What is the most likely diagnosis?
  (D) Norovirus infection (C) Adenovirus infection (A) Rotavirus infection (B) C. difficile colitis (E) Vibrio parahaemolyticus infection
Reason: The patient's symptoms of fever, diarrhea, and bilateral conjunctival injection, along with the history of illness in other children at daycare, suggest a viral infection, which is consistent with adenovirus. Adenovirus is known to cause both gastrointestinal and conjunctival symptoms, particularly in pediatric populations, further supporting this diagnosis.
Answer: (C) Adenovirus infection

Question: A 6-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother for coughing, nasal congestion, and intermittent wheezing for the past 2 months. The child has a history of eczema. Since birth, he has had three upper respiratory tract infections that resolved without treatment, and one episode of acute otitis media treated with antibiotics. His family moved into affordable housing 3 months ago. His temperature is 37.2°C (98.9°F), pulse is 120/min, respirations are 28/min, and blood pressure is 90/60 mmHg. There are scattered wheezes on pulmonary examination. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? (A) Flow cytometry for B cells (C) Skin prick testing (D) Throat culture (E) Dihydrorhodamine 123 test (B) Spirometry
Reason: The child presents with chronic respiratory symptoms, including coughing, wheezing, and a history of eczema, which raises suspicion for asthma. Spirometry is the most appropriate next step in management, as it can help assess lung function and confirm the diagnosis of asthma, especially in a child with these respiratory symptoms.
Answer: (B) Spirometry

Question: A 5-year-old boy is brought to the emergency room lapsing in and out of consciousness. The mother reports that 30 minutes ago, the young boy was found exiting the garage severely confused. A container of freshly spilled antifreeze was found on the garage floor. The next appropriate step would be to administer: (E) Fomepizole (C) Ammonium chloride (A) Dimercaprol (B) N-acetylcysteine (D) Flumazenil
Reason: The presentation of confusion and the presence of spilled antifreeze suggest potential antifreeze (ethylene glycol) poisoning, which is a medical emergency. Fomepizole is the antidote specifically indicated for ethylene glycol and methanol poisoning, as it inhibits the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase, preventing the toxic metabolites from forming, making it the most appropriate next step in management.
Answer: (E) Fomepizole

[INFO] Opinion paths:
Path 1: To determine the most appropriate assessment of the woman’s carrier status for the disease affecting her brother, we need to consider the inheritance pattern of phenylketonuria (PKU), which is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase and typically follows an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern.

In this scenario:
- The woman's brother has PKU, indicating he has two copies of the recessive allele (let’s denote this as "pp").
- The woman does not show symptoms, which suggests that she is either homozygous for the normal allele (PP) or a carrier (Pp).
- Their parents are healthy, which means they could both be carriers (Pp) or one could be a carrier while the other is homozygous normal (PP).

Given that the brother is affected (pp), both parents must be carriers. This means there is a possibility that the woman is also a carrier.

Now we can calculate the probabilities:
1. If both parents are carriers (Pp), the potential genetic combinations for their children are:
   - PP (25%)
   - Pp (50%)
   - pp (25%)

2. Since the woman is the sibling of the affected child, we can use the information that her parents are carriers and calculate her carrier status:
   - The probability that she is a carrier (Pp) given that her brother is affected (pp) is 2 out of 3, or approximately 67%.

Thus, the most appropriate assessment of her carrier status for the disease affecting her brother is:
**Answer: (A) 67%**
Path 2: Let's analyze the situation step by step. 

The case describes a 35-year-old woman whose younger brother has mild developmental delay and a need to limit dietary intake of phenylalanine. These symptoms are suggestive of phenylketonuria (PKU), an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the PAH gene, which leads to the inability to metabolize phenylalanine.

In autosomal recessive inheritance:
- Affected individuals (like her brother) must inherit two copies of the mutated gene, one from each parent.
- Carriers (like the woman, if she is one) have one normal and one mutated gene.

Given that her brother is affected, both of their parents must be carriers (each having one normal and one mutant allele). The woman is the sister of the affected individual, but since she is healthy, she could either be a carrier or not.

To assess her carrier status:
1. There is a 25% chance that she is a non-carrier (inheriting the normal allele from both parents).
2. There is a 50% chance that she is a carrier (inheriting the normal allele from one parent and the mutated allele from the other).
3. There is a 25% chance that she is affected (which is not the case here since she has no symptoms).

Thus, the probability that she is a carrier is 50%. 

Therefore, the most appropriate assessment of her carrier status for the disease affecting her brother is:

Answer: (E) 50%
Path 3: This scenario suggests that the younger brother is likely affected by phenylketonuria (PKU), which is an autosomal recessive disorder. Since both parents are healthy, they are likely carriers of the PKU gene mutation. 

For the woman seeking genetic counseling, we can assess her carrier status based on the following:

1. If the brother has PKU, he must have inherited one mutated allele from each parent.
2. The woman is a sibling and thus has a 25% chance of being affected (which does not apply here since she is healthy), a 50% chance of being a carrier (which is what we're assessing), and a 25% chance of not being a carrier.

Therefore, the most appropriate assessment of her carrier status is that there is a 50% chance she is a carrier of the PKU gene mutation.

So the answer is: (E) 50%
Path 4: The scenario describes a condition consistent with phenylketonuria (PKU), which is an autosomal recessive disorder. For a child to have PKU, both parents must be carriers of the mutated gene.

Given that the brother has mild developmental delay and dietary restrictions due to phenylalanine, it suggests he has PKU. The parents of the affected child are healthy, which implies they are likely carriers of the PKU gene.

The woman in question is the sister of the affected brother. The probability of her being a carrier can be assessed as follows:

1. Since the brother is affected (has PKU), each parent contributes one allele for the PKU gene. They must each have one normal allele (let’s denote it as "N") and one mutated allele (denote it as "n").
2. The potential genotypes for the parents are therefore: both are carriers (Nn).
3. The possible genotypes for the offspring of two carriers (Nn x Nn) would be:
   - NN (normal) - 25%
   - Nn (carrier) - 50%
   - nn (affected) - 25%

Since the sister has not been tested but has a brother with the condition, she has a 2 in 3 chance of being a carrier (Nn) because if she is NN, she cannot have an affected brother, and if she is nn, it means she is affected, which is not the case.

Thus, the probability that the sister is a carrier (Nn) is 2 out of 3, which is approximately 67%.

Therefore, the most appropriate assessment of her carrier status for the disease affecting her brother is:

**Answer: (A) 67%**
Path 5: Let's analyze the situation step by step.

The younger brother has mild developmental delay and a pale complexion, which suggests he may have phenylketonuria (PKU), a genetic disorder caused by a deficiency in phenylalanine hydroxylase. PKU is an autosomal recessive disorder, meaning that both parents must be carriers of the mutated gene for a child to be affected by the condition.

1. **Understanding inheritance**: Since the brother is affected and shows symptoms, he must have inherited one mutated gene from each parent. Therefore, both parents are carriers (heterozygous) for the PKU gene mutation.

2. **Assessing the woman's carrier status**: The woman in question is the sister of the affected brother. If her brother is affected by an autosomal recessive condition, the probability that she is a carrier (heterozygous) is 2/3 (or approximately 67%). This is because:
   - There are three possible genotypes for the sister: 
     - She could be homozygous normal (not a carrier) – 1 possibility 
     - She could be a carrier (heterozygous) – 2 possibilities (one from each parent)
     - She could be homozygous for the mutant allele (which is not the case since she is not affected)

Therefore, the most appropriate assessment of her carrier status for the disease affecting her brother is:

Answer: (A) 67%
Path 6: To solve this question, we need to consider the inheritance pattern of the condition affecting the woman's brother. The symptoms described (mild developmental delay, pale complexion, and dietary restrictions for phenylalanine) are characteristic of phenylketonuria (PKU), which is an autosomal recessive disorder.

1. **Understanding Autosomal Recessive Inheritance**:
   - In autosomal recessive conditions, an individual must inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to express the disease.
   - Carriers have one normal allele and one mutated allele, and they do not express the disease but can pass the mutated allele to their offspring.

2. **Analyzing the Family History**:
   - The woman's brother is affected, meaning he has two copies of the mutated gene.
   - Her parents are healthy, which means they are likely carriers (each has one normal allele and one mutated allele).

3. **Genetic Counseling**:
   - If both parents are carriers, there is a 25% chance that any child they have will be affected (inheriting two copies of the mutated gene), a 50% chance that the child will be a carrier, and a 25% chance that the child will inherit two normal alleles.

4. **Calculating the Woman's Carrier Status**:
   - Since the woman is healthy and her brother is affected, we need to assess the probability of her being a carrier.
   - If both parents are carriers, the probability that she is a carrier is 2 out of 3 (since she has a 1/4 chance of being affected, and if she is not affected, she can either be a carrier or have two normal alleles).

Thus, the most appropriate assessment of her carrier status for the disease affecting her brother is:

**Answer: (A) 67%**
Path 7: Let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. The younger brother has symptoms consistent with phenylketonuria (PKU), which is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a deficiency in the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. 

2. For a child to express an autosomal recessive condition like PKU, both parents must be carriers (heterozygous for the gene mutation) or one parent must be affected (homozygous recessive). In this case, since both parents are healthy, they are likely carriers of the PKU gene.

3. The 35-year-old woman is the sister of the affected brother. To determine her carrier status, we need to consider the inheritance pattern. Since her brother is affected, there is a 2/3 chance that she is a carrier (since there are three possible genotypes for her given that one of the parents must be a carrier: they could be homozygous normal, heterozygous, or homozygous recessive).

4. Therefore, the probability that she is a carrier is 2/3, which can be expressed as approximately 67%.

Thus, the most appropriate assessment of her carrier status for the disease affecting her brother is: 

Answer: (A) 67%
Path 8: To determine the appropriate assessment of the woman's carrier status for the disease affecting her brother, we first need to identify the likely inheritance pattern of the condition affecting her brother. Given that her brother has mild developmental delay, a pale complexion, and requires dietary restrictions regarding phenylalanine, it is suggestive of Phenylketonuria (PKU), which is an autosomal recessive disorder.

Since the woman is healthy and her parents are also healthy, the most likely scenario is that both parents are carriers of the PKU allele. 

1. If both parents are carriers (each with a 1 in 2 chance of passing the allele), their children would have the following probabilities:
   - 25% chance of being affected (having two copies of the recessive allele)
   - 50% chance of being carriers (having one copy of the recessive allele)
   - 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier (having two copies of the normal allele)

2. Since the brother is affected, we know he inherited one allele from each parent, which means each parent must be a carrier.

3. The woman, being a sibling of the affected brother, has a 2 in 3 chance of being a carrier (1 in 3 chance of not being a carrier). 

Thus, the most appropriate assessment of her carrier status for the disease affecting her brother is:

**Answer: (A) 67%**
Path 9: Let's analyze the situation step by step. The condition affecting her brother, which is characterized by developmental delay and the need to limit phenylalanine intake, is suggestive of phenylketonuria (PKU), an autosomal recessive disorder. This means that an individual must inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to express the disease.

1. **Parents' Status**: Since both of her parents are healthy and her brother has PKU, both parents must be carriers of the PKU gene mutation. This is because the brother has the condition, which requires him to inherit one mutated gene from each parent.

2. **Carrier Status of the Woman**: As the woman is the sister of the affected brother, we need to assess her likelihood of being a carrier. She has a 25% chance of being affected (having two mutated alleles), a 50% chance of being a carrier (having one mutated allele and one normal allele), and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not carrying any mutated alleles. 

Thus, her probability of being a carrier is 50%.

The most appropriate assessment of her carrier status for the disease affecting her brother is:

**Answer: (E) 50%**
Path 10: Let's analyze the situation step by step. The younger brother has mild developmental delay and needs to limit his dietary intake of phenylalanine, which suggests he may have phenylketonuria (PKU). PKU is an autosomal recessive disorder, which means that both parents must be carriers of the gene mutation for the child to be affected.

Since the woman does not exhibit any symptoms and is in good health, it is likely that she is a carrier of the PKU gene, but we cannot determine her carrier status without further testing. The parents are healthy, suggesting they might be carriers as well.

Let's consider the probabilities:

1. If her parents are both carriers (which they likely are, as they have an affected son), there is a 25% chance for each child to be affected, a 50% chance for each child to be a carrier (like the mother), and a 25% chance for each child to be unaffected and not a carrier.

2. Since her brother is affected, both parents are confirmed to be carriers. Therefore, the probability that she is a carrier is 2 out of 3 (since there is one affected child out of three possible genotypes: affected, carrier, unaffected).

Thus, the most appropriate assessment of her carrier status for the disease affecting her brother is approximately 67%.

Answer: (A) 67%

Question: An otherwise healthy 28-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 14-day history of a painful red nodules on her legs associated with malaise and mild joint pains. She reports that the nodules were initially smaller and distinct but some have fused together over the past 3–4 days and now appear like bruises. There is no preceding history of fever, trauma, or insect bites. Her vital signs are within normal limits. A photograph of the tender lesions on her shins is shown. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Complete blood count and antistreptolysin O (ASO) titers are within the reference range. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate is 30 mm/h. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management ? (D) Stool culture (E) Skin biopsy (A) Oral amoxicillin (C) X-ray of the chest (B) Oral isoniazid
Reason: The answer is (C) X-ray of the chest. The patient's presentation of painful red nodules on the legs, malaise, and joint pains, particularly with the possibility of these nodules resembling bruises from fusion, raises suspicion for a systemic condition such as vasculitis or an infectious process like adult-onset Still's disease. An X-ray of the chest would be appropriate to assess for any underlying infections or associated pulmonary involvement before proceeding to more invasive diagnostic measures.

Question: A 56-year-old African American woman comes to the physician because of frequent urination. For the past year, she has had to urinate multiple times every hour. She has been thirstier and hungrier than usual. She has not had any pain with urination. She has no time to exercise because she works as an accountant. Her diet mostly consists of pizza and cheeseburgers. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Today, her blood glucose level is 200 mg/dL and her hemoglobin A1c is 7.4%. Urinalysis shows microalbuminuria. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's proteinuria? (D) Renal papillary necrosis (B) Increased glomerular filtration (A) Calcific sclerosis of glomerular arterioles (C) Diffuse nodular glomerulosclerosis (E) Loss of glomerular electrical charge
Reason: The answer is (B) Increased glomerular filtration. This patient's presentation is consistent with diabetes mellitus, which is known to cause diabetic nephropathy characterized by microalbuminuria due to hyperfiltration. As blood glucose levels rise, glomerular filtration can increase in an attempt to excrete excess glucose, leading to an overload of protein filtration and resultant proteinuria.
Answer: (B) Increased glomerular filtration

Question: A 4-year-old boy presents to the emergency department with a 1 hour history of severe knee pain after he bumped his knee against a door. He has no past medical history though his parents say that he seems to bruise fairly easily. His parents say that they are afraid he may have accidentally taken his grandfather's warfarin medication. On presentation, he is found to have an erythematous, warm, swollen knee. Based on this presentation, a panel of laboratory tests are ordered with the following results:

Bleeding time: 3 minutes
Prothrombin time (PT): 12 seconds
Partial thromboplastin time (PTT): 56 seconds
Mixing studies show no change in the above lab values

Which of the following is most likely the cause of this patient's symptoms? (C) Platelet defect (A) Deficiency in a coagulation factor (B) Deficiency of von Willebrand factor (E) Warfarin toxicity (D) Production of an autoantibody
Reason: The answer is (D) Production of an autoantibody. The patient's prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (PTT) with normal prothrombin time (PT) and bleeding time, along with the unchanging values in the mixing studies, suggests the presence of an inhibitor rather than a deficiency in a specific coagulation factor, which would typically show improvement with mixing studies. This pattern is often indicative of the presence of an autoantibody that inhibits specific clotting factors, leading to the observed symptoms.
Answer: (D) Production of an autoantibody

Question: A 55-year-old man with a 60 pack-year smoking history is referred by his primary care physician for a pulmonary function test (PFT). A previously obtained chest x-ray is shown below. Which of the following will most likely appear in his PFT report? (D) Residual volume normal, total lung capacity normal (B) Residual volume increased, total lung capacity increased (E) Residual volume normal, total lung capacity decreased (C) Residual volume decreased, total lung capacity increased (A) Residual volume increased, total lung capacity decreased
Reason: The answer is (B) Residual volume increased, total lung capacity increased because the patient's significant smoking history suggests the possibility of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which is characterized by increased lung volumes due to air trapping. In conditions like emphysema, both residual volume and total lung capacity typically increase due to the destruction of alveoli and loss of elastic recoil, leading to difficulties in exhalation.

Question: A 62-year-old man comes to the physician because of progressive fatigue and dyspnea on exertion for 3 months. During this time, he has also had increased straining during defecation and a 10-kg (22-lb) weight loss. He has no personal or family history of serious medical illness. Physical examination shows conjunctival pallor. Laboratory studies show microcytic anemia. Test of the stool for occult blood is positive. Colonoscopy shows an exophytic mass in the ascending colon. Pathologic examination of the mass shows a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma. A gain-of-function mutation in which of the following genes is most likely involved in the pathogenesis of this patient's condition? (A) DCC (D) APC (E) KRAS (B) TP53 (C) MLH1
Reason: The answer is (E) KRAS because KRAS mutations are commonly associated with the development of colorectal cancer, particularly in well-differentiated adenocarcinomas. This patient's presentation, which includes an exophytic mass in the colon and a positive stool occult blood test, indicates malignancy, and the activation of KRAS is a critical step in the oncogenic pathways associated with colorectal tumorigenesis.

Question: A 36-year-old woman comes to the physician for a routine gynecological examination. She feels well. Menses occur with normal flow at regular 28-day intervals and last for 3 to 5 days. Her last menstrual period was 20 days ago. She is sexually active with one male partner and they use condoms inconsistently. Her sister was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 40 years. She drinks a glass of wine occasionally with dinner and has smoked 10 cigarettes daily for the past 15 years. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination including a complete pelvic exam shows no abnormalities. Urine pregnancy test is negative. A Pap smear shows atypical glandular cells. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? (C) Perform a diagnostic loop electrosurgical excision (A) Repeat cervical cytology at 12 months (E) Perform colposcopy with endocervical sampling (B) Perform colposcopy with endocervical and endometrial sampling (D) Perform colposcopy and cytology every 6 months for 2 years
Reason: The most appropriate next step in management after finding atypical glandular cells on a Pap smear is (B) Perform colposcopy with endocervical and endometrial sampling. This is because atypical glandular cells can indicate the presence of cervical or endometrial pathology, and performing colposcopy with additional sampling helps to assess and rule out any significant lesions, particularly in light of the patient's family history of breast cancer and other risk factors.

Question: A 2-day-old boy is evaluated in the nursery for minimal movement in his left upper limb. He was born at 41 weeks gestation by an assisted forceps-vaginal delivery to a 42-year-old obese woman. Birth weight was 4.4 kg (9.7 lb). The mother had 4 previous vaginal deliveries, all requiring forceps. Examinations of the left upper limb show that the arm hangs by his side and is rotated medially. His forearm is extended and pronated, and his wrist and fingers are flexed. Moro reflex is present only on the right side. Which of the following muscles was spared from the injury sustained during delivery? (C) Triceps (B) Biceps (D) Supraspinatus (A) Deltoid (E) Infraspinatus
Reason: The most appropriate answer is (C) Triceps because the clinical presentation suggests a lower brachial plexus injury or Erb’s palsy, which typically affects the deltoid, biceps, and other muscles innervated by the upper trunk of the brachial plexus. The triceps, innervated by the radial nerve, are spared because they are not affected by this type of injury, allowing for some extension at the elbow despite the weakened function of the other muscles.

Question: A 67-year-old man presents to his primary care physician because of a dry cough and shortness of breath for 2 months. He notes that recently he has had easy bruising of the skin without obvious trauma. He has a past history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Family history is non-contributory. He has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for 35 years but quit 3 years ago. His temperature is 37.1°C (98.7°F), blood pressure is 170/80 mm Hg, and pulse is 85/min. On physical examination, the patient's face is round and plethoric and there are large supraclavicular fat pads. Breath sounds are diminished all over the chest without focal rales or wheezes. Chest X-ray is shown in the picture. Which of the following is the most likely etiology of this patient's condition? (D) Large cell carcinoma of the lung (E) Wegener granulomatosis (B) Adenocarcinoma of the lung (C) Squamous cell carcinoma of the lung (A) Small cell lung cancer
Reason: The most likely etiology of this patient's condition is (A) Small cell lung cancer. This patient's symptoms, including the dry cough, shortness of breath, easy bruising, and clinical findings such as a plethoric face and supraclavicular fat pads, suggest the possibility of paraneoplastic syndromes associated with small cell lung cancer, which can lead to conditions like inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) or ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) production, contributing to his symptoms. Additionally, the patient's significant smoking history further increases the likelihood of lung cancer.

Based on these results, which of the following statements is most likely to be correct?" (C) 86% of heights in women are likely to fall between 63.9 and 64.1 inches. (A) 68% of weights in women are likely to fall between 153 and 155 pounds. (B) 99.7% of heights in women are likely to fall between 63.7 and 64.3 inches. (E) 95% of heights in men are likely to fall between 68.85 and 69.15 inches. (D) 99.7% of heights in men are likely to fall between 68.8 and 69.2 inches.
Reason: To support the answer, we analyze the data given about the height of women. The height for women is normally distributed with a mean of 64 inches and a standard deviation of 0.1 inches. According to the empirical rule (or 68-95-99.7 rule), approximately 99.7% of values in a normal distribution fall within three standard deviations from the mean. Thus, for heights in women, three standard deviations below and above the mean would be calculated as follows: 

- 64 - (3 * 0.1) = 63.7 inches
- 64 + (3 * 0.1) = 64.3 inches

This confirms that the correct statement is that 99.7% of heights in women are likely to fall between 63.7 and 64.3 inches.
Answer: (B) 99.7% of heights in women are likely to fall between 63.7 and 64.3 inches.

Question: A 59-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of a 2-day history of worsening fever, chills, malaise, productive cough, and difficulty breathing. Three days ago, she returned from a trip to South Africa. She has type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and varicose veins. Her current medications include metformin, lisinopril, and atorvastatin. Her temperature is 39.4°C (102.9°F), pulse is 102/minute, blood pressure is 94/68 mm Hg, and respirations are 31/minute. Pulse oximetry on 2 L of oxygen via nasal cannula shows an oxygen saturation of 91%. Examination reveals decreased breath sounds and dull percussion over the left lung base. The skin is very warm and well-perfused. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show:
Hemoglobin 11.6 g/dL
Leukocyte count 15,400/mm3
platelet count 282,000/mm3
Serum
Na+ 144 mEq/L
Cl- 104 mEq/L
K+ 4.9 mEq/L
Creatinine 1.5 mg/dL
Blood and urine for cultures are obtained. Intravenous fluid resuscitation is begun. Which of the following is the next best step in management?" (D) Intravenous vancomycin and ceftriaxone (A) Intravenous ceftriaxone and azithromycin (C) External cooling and intravenous acetaminophen (B) Erythromycin (E) CT of the chest with contrast
Reason: To support the answer, we consider the clinical presentation and risk factors of the patient. The patient exhibits signs of severe infection, including fever, productive cough, and difficulty breathing, along with a recent travel history that raises concern for pneumonia, possibly with complications. Given her age, comorbidities (such as type 2 diabetes), and signs of sepsis (elevated heart rate, low blood pressure, and hypoxia), broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics are warranted to cover common pathogens including both Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus. Therefore, initiating treatment with intravenous vancomycin and ceftriaxone is appropriate to combat potential pneumonia and prevent further deterioration.
Answer: (D) Intravenous vancomycin and ceftriaxone

Question: A 28-year-old man presents to his primary care physician after experiencing intense nausea and vomiting yesterday. He states that he ran a 15-kilometer race in the morning and felt well while resting in a hammock afterward. However, when he rose from the hammock, he experienced two episodes of emesis accompanied by a sensation that the world was spinning around him. This lasted about one minute and self-resolved. He denies tinnitus or hearing changes, but he notes that he still feels slightly imbalanced. He has a past medical history of migraines, but he typically does not have nausea or vomiting with the headaches. At this visit, the patient’s temperature is 98.5°F (36.9°C), blood pressure is 126/81 mmHg, pulse is 75/min, and respirations are 13/min. Cardiopulmonary exam is unremarkable. Cranial nerves are intact, and gross motor function and sensation are within normal limits. When the patient’s head is turned to the right side and he is lowered quickly to the supine position, he claims that he feels “dizzy and nauseous.” Nystagmus is noted in both eyes. Which of the following is the best treatment for this patient’s condition? (D) Meclizine (C) Triptan therapy (B) Thiazide diuretic (A) Particle repositioning maneuver (E) Increased fluid intake
Reason: The best treatment for this patient’s condition is the particle repositioning maneuver, as he exhibits signs consistent with Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV), where specific head movements provoke dizziness and nausea due to displaced otoliths in the inner ear. This maneuver helps relocate the otoliths back into their proper position, thereby alleviating the patient's symptoms.
Answer: (A) Particle repositioning maneuver

Question: A 62-year-old man presents to the physician because of difficulty initiating urination, terminal dribbling of urine, and bone pain for 3 months. He has no medical history of serious illness, and he currently takes no medications. His father had prostate cancer at age 58. His vital signs are within normal limits. The physical examination shows tenderness over the lower lumbar vertebrae and the right pelvis. The digital rectal exam (DRE) shows a prostate size equivalent to 2 finger pads with a hard nodule. The laboratory tests show the following results:
Serum
Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) 15 ng/mL
Testosterone 350 ng/mL (N=270–1070 ng/mL)
The prostate biopsy confirms the presence of prostate cancer with aggressive histologic features. The MRI shows local extension of the tumor. The radionuclide bone scan shows multiple metastatic sites. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? (E) Radical prostatectomy (C) Chemotherapy (B) Androgen deprivation therapy (D) Radiation therapy (A) Active surveillance
Reason: Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is the most appropriate next step in management for this patient with advanced prostate cancer and multiple metastatic sites. This is because ADT can help reduce testosterone levels, which are known to fuel the growth of prostate cancer cells, thus managing the disease and potentially improving survival in patients with metastatic prostate cancer. Given the aggressive nature of this patient's cancer and the presence of metastasis, immediate intervention to control disease progression is crucial.

Question: A 33-year-old woman comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. She has a history of Crohn disease, for which she takes methotrexate. She and her husband would like to start trying to have a child. Because of the teratogenicity of methotrexate, the physician switches the patient from methotrexate to a purine analog drug that inhibits lymphocyte proliferation by blocking nucleotide synthesis. Toxicity of the newly prescribed purine analog would most likely increase if the patient was also being treated with which of the following medications? (A) Febuxostat (E) Cyclosporine (C) Rasburicase (B) Pemetrexed (D) Hydroxyurea
Reason: Febuxostat, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor used to manage gout, can increase the toxicity of purine analogs like azathioprine due to its ability to inhibit the metabolism of purines, potentially leading to elevated levels of the active drug and increased risk of adverse effects. Purine analogs require careful monitoring, especially when concomitant medications could interfere with their metabolism and enhance toxicity.
Answer: (A) Febuxostat

Question: A 17-year-old high school student comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of insomnia. On school nights, he goes to bed around 11 p.m. but has had persistent problems falling asleep and instead studies at his desk until he feels sleepy around 2 a.m. He does not wake up in the middle of the night. He is worried that he does not get enough sleep. He has significant difficulties waking up on weekdays and has repeatedly been late to school. At school, he experiences daytime sleepiness and drinks 1–2 cups of coffee in the mornings. He tries to avoid daytime naps. On the weekends, he goes to bed around 2 a.m. and sleeps in until 10 a.m., after which he feels rested. He has no history of severe illness and does not take medication. Which of the following most likely explains this patient's sleep disorder? (D) Irregular sleep-wake disorder (B) Psychophysiologic insomnia (E) Inadequate sleep hygiene (C) Advanced sleep-wake disorder (A) Delayed sleep-wake disorder
Reason: The patient's sleep pattern is consistent with delayed sleep-wake phase disorder, characterized by a significant disparity between the individual's preferred sleep schedule and societal demands. His tendency to stay awake until 2 a.m. and sleep late on weekends aligns with a delayed circadian rhythm, indicating that he has difficulty falling asleep early despite needing to wake up early for school, which contributes to his daytime sleepiness and poor functioning during weekdays.
Answer: (A) Delayed sleep-wake disorder

Question: A 6-month-old infant boy (neonate) is brought to the clinic for a check-up by a couple who recently adopted him from foster care. The biological mother was from a rehabilitation facility and was found incompetent to care for the child, hence he was handed over to foster care. No other information is available regarding his prenatal or birth history. On examination, his weight is found to be below the 3rd percentile. Physical appearance is remarkable for midfacial hypoplasia with a flattened nasal bridge, smooth philtrum, and thin lips. Auscultation reveals a grade 3/6 holosystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border. Developmental delay is noted as well. Which of the following teratogens is most likely to be associated with the neonate’s presentation? (B) Lithium (E) Cocaine (C) Phenytoin (D) Tobacco (A) Alcohol
Reason: The neonate's presentation is indicative of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), characterized by features such as midfacial hypoplasia, a smooth philtrum, thin lips, and growth deficiencies, which are common in infants exposed to alcohol in utero. Additionally, the associated developmental delay and the presence of a congenital heart defect (holosystolic murmur) further support the diagnosis, as alcohol exposure is known to cause various cardiac anomalies.

Question: A 31-year-old female presents to the emergency room complaining of fever and difficulty breathing. She first noticed these symptoms 3 days prior to presentation. Her past medical history is notable for well-controlled asthma. She does not smoke and drinks alcohol socially. Upon further questioning, she reports that her urine is tea-colored when she wakes up but generally becomes more yellow and clear over the course of the day. Her temperature is 100.8°F (38.2°C), blood pressure is 135/90 mmHg, pulse is 115/min, and respirations are 20/min. Lung auscultation reveals rales at the right lung base. Laboratory analysis is shown below:

Hemoglobin: 9.4 g/dL
Hematocrit: 31%
Leukocyte count: 3,700 cells/mm^3 with normal differential
Platelet count: 110,000/mm^3
Reticulocyte count: 3%

A chest radiograph reveals consolidation in the right lung base and the patient is given oral antibiotics. Which of the following processes is likely impaired in this patient? (A) Inactivation of C3 convertase (C) Erythrocyte cytoskeletal formation (D) Nicotinamide dinucleotide phosphate metabolism (E) Aminolevulinic acid metabolism (B) Inactivation of C5 convertase
Reason: The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings suggest she may be experiencing a hemolytic anemia, which is supported by the anemia (low hemoglobin and hematocrit), elevated reticulocyte count, tea-colored urine, and signs of pulmonary consolidation. In this context, the inactivation of C3 convertase relates to the potential involvement of the complement system in immune-mediated hemolysis, which can lead to both anemia and respiratory symptoms, making it the most likely impaired process.
Answer: (A) Inactivation of C3 convertase

Question: A 4-year-old girl is brought to the clinic by her parents, who are concerned about an abdominal swelling that they noticed 2 days ago. The family immigrated from Bangladesh to the United States recently. The mother mentions that the girl has never been as active as other children of the same age but has no medical conditions either. Her appetite has declined, and she vomited a few times last week. On physical examination, slight prominence of frontal bosses at the forehead is noticeable with malar prominence and massive splenomegaly. Slight beading at the end of her ribs is evident. She has a dusky complexion, sclerae are anicteric, and oral mucosa is pale. Laboratory results are pending. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for the findings seen in this patient? (D) Extramedullary hematopoiesis due to thalassemia (E) Lymphoma (A) Glycogen storage disease (C) Renal failure (B) Graves disease
Reason: The child's presentation, including abdominal swelling due to massive splenomegaly, prominent frontal bosses, rib beading, and pale oral mucosa, is suggestive of a chronic hemolytic anemia, which is commonly seen in thalassemia. The signs of extramedullary hematopoiesis, such as splenomegaly and changes in facial bone structure, are consistent with the body's compensatory mechanism to produce more red blood cells when the bone marrow is unable to meet the demand, making thalassemia the most likely explanation for her findings.
Answer: (D) Extramedullary hematopoiesis due to thalassemia

Question: A 42-year-old woman comes to the physician because of 2 episodes of loss of consciousness over the past week. She recovered immediately and was not confused following the episodes. During the past 5 months, she has also had increased shortness of breath and palpitations. She has been unable to carry out her daily activities. She also reports some chest tightness that resolves with rest. She has no history of serious illness and takes no medications. She immigrated with her family from India 10 years ago. Her temperature is 37.3°C (99.1°F), pulse is 115/min and irregular, and blood pressure is 108/70 mm Hg. Examination shows jugular venous distention and pitting edema below the knees. Bilateral crackles are heard at the lung bases. Cardiac examination shows an accentuated and split S2. There is an opening snap followed by a low-pitched diastolic murmur in the fifth left intercostal space at the midclavicular line. An ECG shows atrial fibrillation and right axis deviation. Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of these findings? (C) Decreased left ventricular contractility (E) Increased left atrial pressure (D) Increased systemic arterial resistance (B) Increased left to right shunting (A) Increased left ventricular end diastolic pressure
Reason: The patient's signs, such as jugular venous distention, pitting edema, bilateral crackles, and the presence of an opening snap followed by a diastolic murmur, suggest heart failure with diastolic dysfunction, likely due to mitral stenosis. In mitral stenosis, the left atrial pressure is increased as the heart struggles to fill properly and manage blood flow, leading to the symptoms observed, including pulmonary congestion and edema.

Vital signs include: blood pressure of 110/70 mm Hg, heart rate 104/min, respiratory rate 18/min, and temperature 36.6°C (98.0°F). Physical examination reveals 2/5 strength in both left upper and lower extremities. After 2 hours, the patient’s symptoms suddenly disappear. An electrocardiogram (ECG) is obtained (see image). Which of the following medications could prevent ischemic attacks in this patient in the future? (A) Acetylsalicylic acid (C) Enoxaparin (B) Clopidogrel (D) Heparin (E) Warfarin
Reason: The correct answer to the question is not actually (E) Warfarin; it is (A) Acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) or (B) Clopidogrel, which are both antiplatelet agents used to prevent future ischemic attacks. 

In this scenario, the patient exhibits classic signs of a transient ischemic attack (TIA), characterized by sudden onset neurological deficits that resolve, indicating a temporary decrease in blood flow to the brain. Antiplatelet medications like aspirin and clopidogrel are typically preferred in managing and preventing TIAs and ischemic strokes, rather than anticoagulants like warfarin, which are more appropriate for specific conditions like atrial fibrillation or venous thrombosis. Therefore, a thorough understanding of the patient's condition and the mechanism of action of the medications involved is essential for selecting the appropriate prophylactic therapy.

He describes the cough as productive and producing white sputum that is sometimes streaked with blood. He also says he has lost 10 lb in the last 3 months. Past medical history is unremarkable. The patient denies any smoking history, alcohol, or recreational drug use. The vital signs include blood pressure 115/75 mm Hg, heart rate 120/min, respiratory rate 20/min, and temperature 36.6℃ (97.8℉). On physical examination, the patient is ill-looking and thin with no pallor or jaundice. Cardiopulmonary auscultation reveals some fine crackles in the right upper lobe. A chest radiograph reveals a right upper lobe homogeneous density. Which of the following tests would be most helpful in making a definitive diagnosis of active infection in this patient? (C) Silver stain (B) Ziehl-Neelsen stain (D) PPD test (A) Gram stain (E) Interferon-gamma assay
Reason: The correct answer is (B) Ziehl-Neelsen stain, as this test is specifically used to identify acid-fast bacilli, most notably Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which is responsible for tuberculosis (TB). 

In this case, the patient's symptoms—chronic cough with blood-streaked sputum, fever, night sweats, and significant weight loss—are highly suggestive of an active TB infection, particularly given his history and the findings on the chest radiograph. The Ziehl-Neelsen stain allows for direct visualization of the bacteria in sputum or other specimens, facilitating a definitive diagnosis of TB in this patient. Understanding the clinical context and the diagnostic capabilities of different stains is crucial in determining the most appropriate test for confirming the suspected infection.

Question: A 38-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 3-week history of involuntary movements of her extremities. One year ago, she was fired from her position as an elementary school teacher because she had stopped preparing lessons and was frequently absent without notice. She now lives with her mother. She appears emaciated and malodorous. Examination shows rapid, nonrepetitive jerks of her limbs and face that frequently end with the patient covering her face and yawning. She has an unsteady gait. Genetic testing shows a mutation on chromosome 4. This patient's condition is most likely associated with increased levels of which of the following substances? (E) N-acetyl aspartate (A) Glutamate (B) Gamma-aminobutyric acid (C) Acetylcholine (D) Dopamine
Reason: The correct answer is (D) Dopamine, as this patient likely has Huntington's disease, which is characterized by neurodegeneration in the basal ganglia, particularly affecting the striatum. 

In Huntington's disease, the pathological processes lead to an increase in dopamine levels due to the loss of GABAergic neurons that normally inhibit dopaminergic activity; this results in motor symptoms such as chorea, which aligns with the involuntary movements observed in this patient. Understanding the underlying pathophysiology of Huntington's disease and its effects on neurotransmitter levels is essential for connecting the clinical presentation with the associated biochemical changes.
Answer: (D) Dopamine
[INFO] Sampling path 10 completed.
[INFO] Opinion paths:
Path 1: Let's analyze the clinical scenario step by step:

- The patient presents with altered mental status, muscle rigidity, increased temperature, and autonomic instability, which are concerning for a serious condition such as **neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS)** or **serotonin syndrome**. Given that he was at a party and exhibiting belligerent behavior, there is also the possibility of substance use, including the use of stimulants or other psychoactive drugs.
  
- The symptoms of muscle rigidity and hyperthermia, especially after initial treatment with benzodiazepines and supportive care, suggest a possible diagnosis of NMS.

- **Dantrolene** is a muscle relaxant that is specifically indicated for the treatment of NMS. It works by decreasing calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum of skeletal muscle, which helps to alleviate muscle rigidity and lower elevated temperature.

Given this information, the best next step in management for a patient suspected of having neuroleptic malignant syndrome (or similar conditions) is:

**Answer: (B) Dantrolene**
Path 2: Let's analyze the clinical scenario step by step. 

The patient presents with signs of altered mental status, hyperthermia (103°F), muscle rigidity, tachycardia, and hypotension. These symptoms are suggestive of a severe reaction, possibly related to a substance such as a stimulant or an antipsychotic, but given the context of being at a college party and the presentation, it raises suspicion for serotonin syndrome or neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS).

Key points:
- The patient is showing muscle rigidity and altered mental status.
- The persistent symptoms despite supportive measures (IV fluids, lorazepam) indicate a severe condition.
- Dantrolene is a muscle relaxant that is specifically indicated for the treatment of NMS.

Given that the patient is likely experiencing neuroleptic malignant syndrome due to the muscle rigidity and hyperthermia, the best next step in management is:

**(B) Dantrolene.**

Dantrolene is effective in treating the muscle rigidity and hyperthermia associated with NMS, making it the most appropriate choice in this situation.
Path 3: Let's think through the scenario step by step.

The patient is a 25-year-old man who was initially unconscious, exhibited belligerent behavior, and vomited. After some initial management, he develops muscle rigidity, hyperthermia (temperature of 103°F), and continues to exhibit altered mental status. These symptoms suggest the possibility of a serious condition such as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) or Serotonin Syndrome, particularly given the context of drug use at a party.

However, the key features here—muscle rigidity, hyperthermia, and altered mental status—are more consistent with Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome, especially considering the timing and the fact that he is not responding to initial supportive measures.

In cases of NMS, Dantrolene is often the preferred treatment option, as it directly addresses the rigidity and hyperthermia by acting on muscle contraction.

Given this situation, the best next step in management is:

**Answer: (B) Dantrolene**
Path 4: Let's think step by step. Reason: The patient's presentation suggests a case of severe hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, and altered mental status after a possible substance use episode. The symptoms, especially the muscle rigidity and hyperthermia, are concerning for neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) or malignant hyperthermia, particularly in the context of potential drug use at a party.

Given that the patient has muscle rigidity and is hyperthermic, the best next step in management is to administer dantrolene, which is the primary treatment for malignant hyperthermia and also effective in severe cases of NMS. Dantrolene works by reducing calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum of skeletal muscle, thus relieving muscle rigidity and lowering temperature.

Now, let's evaluate the other options:
- (A) Acetaminophen is not specific for treating the underlying cause of hyperthermia due to muscle rigidity.
- (C) Diazepam can provide sedation but does not address the hyperthermia or muscle rigidity effectively.
- (D) Intubation may be necessary if the patient's airway is compromised, but it is not the first step in treating the underlying issue.
- (E) Supportive therapy alone is insufficient given the severity of the patient's symptoms.

Therefore, the best next step in management is: (B) Dantrolene.
Path 5: Let's analyze the scenario step by step. The patient has presented with signs of altered mental status, hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, and autonomic instability after an initial episode of unconsciousness and vomiting. These symptoms are concerning for a condition such as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) or Serotonin Syndrome, especially given the context of a college party where substances could have been involved.

The key points from the examination are:
- The patient's muscle rigidity and hyperthermia are notable.
- He continues to have altered mental status despite initial supportive measures, including IV fluids and lorazepam.
- The ongoing symptoms suggest a severe reaction that is not improving with initial interventions.

Given the muscle rigidity and hyperthermia, dantrolene is the specific treatment for conditions characterized by malignant hyperthermia or NMS. It acts to reduce calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum in muscle cells, helping to alleviate muscle rigidity and decrease hyperthermia.

Thus, the best next step in management for this patient is:

**Answer: (B) Dantrolene**
Path 6: Let's evaluate the scenario step by step. The patient presented with signs of altered mental status, muscle rigidity, and hyperthermia after being found unconscious, which raises suspicion for a serious condition like neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) or serotonin syndrome, especially given the context of a college party and potential substance use.

1. **Initial Presentation**: The patient initially showed confusion, vomiting, and signs of autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, hypotension).
2. **Clinical Deterioration**: After initial management, he developed severe muscle rigidity, hyperthermia, and persistent altered mental status. The muscle rigidity and hyperthermia are particularly concerning for NMS.
3. **Management**: In cases of NMS, dantrolene is a specific treatment that can help reduce muscle rigidity and heat production. 

Given that the patient's symptoms are consistent with a possible neuroleptic malignant syndrome, and supportive therapy (like IV fluids and antipyretics) is not sufficient to control the rigidity and hyperthermia, **the best next step in management would be Dantrolene**.

Thus, the answer is: **(B) Dantrolene**.
Path 7: Let's think step by step. 

The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of a potential neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) or serotonin syndrome, characterized by altered mental status, hyperthermia, autonomic instability (elevated heart rate and blood pressure), and muscle rigidity. Given the context of a college party, a common cause may be the use of illicit substances or certain medications that could provoke these symptoms.

The acute management of NMS often involves the use of dantrolene, which is a muscle relaxant that can help reduce the rigidity and hyperthermia associated with this condition. Although benzodiazepines like lorazepam and diazepam can also help with muscle rigidity and agitation, they do not directly address the underlying issue of muscle rigidity and hyperthermia as effectively as dantrolene does.

Considering that the patient's symptoms have persisted despite initial supportive measures, the best next step in management to address the muscle rigidity and hyperthermia would be:

Answer: (B) Dantrolene
Path 8: Let's analyze the situation step by step. The patient initially presented with confusion, vomiting, and signs of altered mental status, which improved with IV fluids, analgesics, and anti-emetics. However, he later developed muscle rigidity, hyperthermia (temperature of 103°F), and persistent altered mental status. 

The key symptoms to note are the muscle rigidity and hyperthermia, which can suggest a diagnosis of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) or serotonin syndrome, especially given the context of altered consciousness and party behavior (possibly involving drug use). However, the muscle rigidity and hyperthermia are more suggestive of NMS.

In cases of NMS, dantrolene is often used as a treatment because it acts on the muscle tissue to relieve rigidity and lower body temperature. 

Therefore, given the patient's symptoms of rigidity and hyperthermia, the best next step in management is:

**Answer: (B) Dantrolene**
Path 9: Let's analyze the situation step by step. 

The patient is presenting with symptoms that suggest a serious condition potentially related to drug use or intoxication, particularly with the combination of altered mental status, hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, and autonomic instability (elevated heart rate and blood pressure). These signs are consistent with a condition known as malignant hyperthermia or neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), especially given the context of recent intoxication and the administration of medications like lorazepam.

The key features include:
- Severe muscle rigidity
- Hyperthermia (temperature of 103°F)
- Altered mental status
- Persistence of symptoms despite initial supportive measures

Dantrolene is the specific antidote for malignant hyperthermia and NMS, as it works by reducing calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum in skeletal muscles, thereby alleviating muscle rigidity and hyperthermia.

Given all of this information, the best next step in management for this patient is:

**Answer: (B) Dantrolene**
Path 10: Let's analyze the case step by step.

The patient is a 25-year-old man who exhibited belligerent behavior at a party and then became unconscious, followed by episodes of vomiting. After initial treatment, he developed muscle rigidity, high fever (103°F), and continued incoherence. These symptoms, especially the muscle rigidity and hyperthermia, suggest a possible case of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) or serotonin syndrome, especially since he was at a party where substances may have been consumed.

In cases of severe muscle rigidity and hyperthermia, dantrolene is indicated because it is a muscle relaxant that is used specifically for the treatment of malignant hyperthermia and NMS. While benzodiazepines like lorazepam and diazepam can help with agitation and muscle rigidity, they may not be sufficient in this scenario where the symptoms are persistent and severe.

Given the presence of muscle rigidity and hyperthermia, the best next step in management is (B) Dantrolene. 

So, the answer is: **(B) Dantrolene**.
[INFO] Final decision by majority voting
After reviewing the 10 different reasoning paths and their corresponding answers, it is clear that all paths consistently identify **(B) Dantrolene** as the best next step in management for the patient suspected of having neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) or a similar condition characterized by muscle rigidity and hyperthermia.

Since all paths unanimously support the use of Dantrolene, the majority vote clearly favors this option. Therefore, the final decision is:

**Final Decision: (B) Dantrolene**

Question: A researcher is investigating the relationship between interleukin-1 (IL-1) levels and mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis. In 2017, 10 patients (patients 1–10) with ESRD on hemodialysis were recruited for a pilot study in which IL-1 levels were measured (mean = 88.1 pg/mL). In 2018, 5 additional patients (patients 11–15) were recruited. Results are shown:
Patient IL-1 level (pg/mL) Patient IL-1 level (pg/mL)
Patient 1 (2017) 84 Patient 11 (2018) 91
Patient 2 (2017) 87 Patient 12 (2018) 32
Patient 3 (2017) 95 Patient 13 (2018) 86

Patient 8 (2017) 90
Patient 9 (2017) 85
Patient 10 (2017) 89
Which of the following statements about the results of the study is most accurate?" (A) Systematic error was introduced by the five new patients who joined the study in 2018. (C) The standard deviation was decreased by the five new patients who joined the study in 2018. (D) The median of IL-1 measurements is now larger than the mean. (B) The mean of IL-1 measurements is now larger than the mode. (E) The range of the data set is unaffected by the addition of five new patients in 2018.
"
Reason: The answer is (D) because when calculating the median, we consider the middle value of a sorted dataset, while the mean is affected by all data points. By adding new patients with varying IL-1 levels, it's possible that the distribution of values changes, thereby shifting the median above the mean if the new values introduce lower data points. Specifically, given that the five new patients have values that include lower measurements (like 32), it's likely that the median will increase relative to the mean due to the skew in the dataset.
Answer: (D) The median of IL-1 measurements is now larger than the mean.

Question: A 10-day-old male infant is brought to the emergency room for abdominal distension for the past day. His mother reports that he has been refusing feeds for about 1 day and appears more lethargic than usual. While changing his diaper today, she noticed that the baby felt warm. He has about 1-2 wet diapers a day and has 1-2 seedy stools a day. The mother reports an uncomplicated vaginal delivery. His past medical history is significant for moderate respiratory distress following birth that has since resolved. His temperature is 101°F (38.3°C), blood pressure is 98/69 mmHg, pulse is 174/min, respirations are 47/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. A physical examination demonstrates a baby in moderate distress with abdominal distension. What is the best initial step in the management of this patient? (C) Renal ultrasound (E) Voiding cystourethrogram (A) Cystoscopy (B) Radionuclide scan (D) Urinary catheterization
Reason: The answer is (D) urinary catheterization because the infant's symptoms, including abdominal distension, lethargy, and low urine output (1-2 wet diapers a day), raise concerns for a potential urinary obstruction or infection. Urinary catheterization is the best initial step as it allows for direct measurement of urine output and can help in relieving any obstruction if present, thus guiding further management of the patient's condition.
Answer: (D) Urinary catheterization

Question: A 57-year-old woman undergoes an operation for a long-term toxic multinodular goiter. 13 hours after the procedure, she complains of tingling around her lips and difficulty breathing. While measuring her blood pressure, her hand turned as seen in the picture. On physical examination, she looks anxious and her chest is wheezy on both sides. Which of the following is the best initial treatment of this patient? (B) Human recombinant parathyroid hormone (PTH) (A) Oral calcium and calcitriol (D) Intravenous calcium gluconate (C) Oral magnesium (E) Thiazide diuretic
Reason: The answer is (D) intravenous calcium gluconate because the patient's symptoms—including tingling around the lips, difficulty breathing, and wheezing—suggest hypocalcemia, potentially due to inadvertent removal or damage to the parathyroid glands during her surgery. Intravenous calcium gluconate is the best initial treatment as it provides a rapid way to correct calcium levels and alleviate symptoms, particularly in an emergent situation where the patient is experiencing respiratory distress.
Answer: (D) Intravenous calcium gluconate

Question: A 22-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of several episodes of blood in his urine and decreased urine output for 5 days. His blood pressure is 158/94 mm Hg. Examination shows bilateral lower extremity edema. Urinalysis shows 3+ protein and red blood cell casts. Mass spectrometry analysis of the urinary protein detects albumin, transferrin, and IgG. Which of the following best describes this type of proteinuria? (C) Selective glomerular (B) Overflow (D) Postrenal (A) Tubular (E) Nonselective glomerular
Reason: The correct answer is (E) Nonselective glomerular proteinuria. The presence of both albumin and immunoglobulin G (IgG) in the urine suggests a significant amount of protein is being lost, which is characteristic of nonselective glomerular injury. Typically, selective glomerular proteinuria indicates that primarily smaller proteins (like albumin) are lost, while the presence of larger proteins like IgG points to a damaged filtration barrier in the glomeruli, leading to the loss of a broader range of proteins.
Answer: (E) Nonselective glomerular

Question: A 23-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1, at 26 weeks gestation comes to the physician for a routine prenatal visit. Physical examination shows a uterus consistent in size with a 26-week gestation. Fetal ultrasonography shows a male fetus with a thick band constricting the right lower arm; the limb distal to the constrictive band cannot be visualized. The most likely condition is an example of which of the following embryological abnormalities? (D) Malformation (B) Agenesis (E) Aplasia (C) Disruption (A) Deformation
Reason: The correct answer is (C) Disruption. This condition suggests that there is a structural abnormality caused by the destruction of previously normal tissue, which aligns with the presence of a constrictive band around the limb leading to the inability to visualize the distal arm. Disruption involves the interruption of normal development, such as the effects of a constricting amniotic band syndrome, rather than an inherent genetic malformation or absence of limb development (agenesis or aplasia).
Answer: (C) Disruption

Question: The rapid response team is called for a 74-year-old woman on an inpatient surgical floor for supraventricular tachycardia. The patient had surgery earlier in the day for operative management of a femur fracture. The patient has a history of hypertension, atherosclerosis, type 2 diabetes, and uterine cancer status post total abdominal hysterectomy 20 years prior. With carotid massage, valsalva maneuvers, and metoprolol, the patient breaks out of her supraventricular tachycardia. Thirty minutes later, the nurse notices a decline in the patient’s status. On exam, the patient has a temperature of 98.4°F (36.9°C), blood pressure of 102/74 mmHg, pulse of 86/min, and respirations are 14/min. The patient is now dysarthric with noticeable right upper extremity weakness of 2/5 in elbow flexion and extension. All other extremities demonstrate normal strength and sensation. Which of the following most likely contributed to this decline? (C) Hypertension (A) Atherosclerosis (E) Malignancy (B) Diabetes (D) Long bone fracture
Reason: The correct answer is (A) Atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis can lead to underlying cardiovascular disease, which increases the risk of thromboembolic events; in this case, it likely contributed to the patient's acute decline and neurological deficits, suggesting a possible stroke or transient ischemic attack due to compromised cerebral blood flow. Additionally, given her history of atherosclerotic disease and risk factors, a sudden decline in neurological status in an older patient with known cardiovascular issues aligns well with this underlying condition.
Answer: (A) Atherosclerosis

Question: A 12-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his mother for a rash. The patient had a sore throat a few days ago with symptoms initially well-controlled with lozenges. However, today he had a rash covering his body, which prompted his presentation. The mother states that she did smear an herbal remedy on the rash with no alleviation in symptoms and also gave him a single dose of amoxicillin left over from a previous infection. The patient is up to date on his vaccinations and has no past medical conditions. His temperature is 101°F (38.3°C), blood pressure is 102/68 mmHg, pulse is 97/min, respirations are 19/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Physical exam is notable for the findings in Figures A and B. The rash seen in Figure B is very coarse. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? (E) Urticaria (A) Infectious mononucleosis (C) Rheumatic fever (B) Kawasaki disease (D) Scarlet fever
Reason: Scarlet fever is characterized by a rash that is often coarse, along with a preceding sore throat, which aligns with the patient's symptoms of having a sore throat followed by a widespread rash. The use of leftover amoxicillin also points towards a bacterial infection, as scarlet fever is caused by group A Streptococcus, which is susceptible to this antibiotic.

Question: A 10-year-old boy is presented to the hospital for a kidney transplant. In the operating room, the surgeon connects an allograft kidney renal artery to the aorta, and after a few moments, the kidney becomes cyanotic, edematous, and dusky with mottling. Which of the following in the recipient’s serum is responsible for this rejection? (D) CD4+ T cells (C) CD8+ T cells (B) IgG (E) Macrophages (A) IgA
Reason: The presence of IgG in the recipient's serum indicates an inappropriate immune response against the transplant, leading to acute rejection of the allograft kidney. This type of rejection typically involves antibody-mediated mechanisms, which can result in damage to the transplanted organ evidenced by cyanosis, edema, and mottling observed in this case.

Question: A 39-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician because she has been experiencing intermittent abdominal pain for the last 2 weeks. She says that the pain is squeezing in nature, is located in the right upper quadrant, and is particularly severe after eating a meal. After a diagnosis is made, the patient asks why the pain gets worse after eating. The physician explains that food is detected by the gastrointestinal tract through numerous receptors and that this information is transmitted to other parts of the body to cause compensatory changes. The neurons responsible for transmitting this information are most likely located in a layer of the intestine that has which of the following characteristics? (B) Contains cells that primarily absorb nutrients (C) Contains large blood vessels and large lymphatic vessels (A) Connective tissue that envelops the other layers (E) Contracts to generate local movement in mucosa (D) Contracts to generate peristaltic waves
Reason: The correct answer is (C) because the layer of the intestine described likely refers to the submucosa, which contains large blood vessels and lymphatic vessels that supply the intestine. This layer is essential for the absorption of nutrients and the distribution of signals involved in digestive processes, which can explain why abdominal pain occurs or intensifies after eating due to increased blood flow and nerve activity in response to meal ingestion.
Answer: (C) Contains large blood vessels and large lymphatic vessels

Question: A 28-year-old man presents to the physician because of dizziness and palpitations for the past 12 hours and fever, malaise, headache, and myalgias for the past week. The patient traveled into the woods of Massachusetts 4 weeks ago. He has no known chronic medical conditions, and there is no history of substance use. His temperature is 38.3°C (100.9°F), pulse is 52/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 126/84 mm Hg. His physical examination shows a single, 10-cm, round, erythematous lesion with a bull’s-eye pattern in the right popliteal fossa. His electrocardiogram shows Mobitz I second-degree atrioventricular (AV) block. The complete blood cell count and serum electrolyte levels are normal, but the erythrocyte sedimentation rate is 35 mm/hour. What is the most likely cause of the patient’s cardiac symptoms? (C) Systemic fungal infection (E) Sexually transmitted bacterial infection (B)  Spirochete infection (A) Mycoplasma infection (D) Viral infection transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquito bite
Reason: The patient's presentation is highly suggestive of Lyme disease, which is caused by a spirochete bacterium, Borrelia burgdorferi. The characteristic "bull's-eye" rash (erythema migrans), recent travel to an area endemic for Lyme disease, and the patient's cardiac symptoms, including Mobitz I AV block, support the diagnosis of a spirochete infection as the underlying cause of his symptoms.

Question: A 13-month-old boy with sickle cell anemia is brought to the emergency department because of continuous crying and severe left-hand swelling. His condition started 2 hours earlier without any preceding trauma. The child was given diclofenac syrup at home with no relief. The temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), blood pressure is 100/60 mm Hg, and pulse is 100/min. The physical examination reveals swelling and tenderness to palpation of the left hand. The hemoglobin level is 10.4 g/dL. Which of the following is the best initial step in management of this patient condition? (B) Intravenous meperidine (C) Joint aspiration (A) Intravenous morphine (D) Incentive spirometry (E) Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the affected joint
Reason: The clinical presentation, including severe pain and swelling of the hand without trauma, suggests a vaso-occlusive crisis, which is common in patients with sickle cell anemia. In such cases, the best initial management focuses on pain relief, making intravenous morphine the appropriate choice as it provides effective analgesia for managing the acute pain associated with this condition.

Question: A 27-year-old-man is brought to the emergency department 30 minutes after being involved in a motorcycle accident. He lost control at high speed and was thrown forward onto the handlebars. On arrival, he is alert and responsive. He has abdominal pain and superficial lacerations on his left arm. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows a tender, erythematous area over his epigastrium. The abdomen is soft and non-distended. A CT scan of the abdomen shows no abnormalities. Treatment with analgesics is begun, the lacerations are cleaned and dressed, and the patient is discharged home after 2 hours of observation. Four days later, the patient returns to the emergency department with gradually worsening upper abdominal pain, fever, poor appetite, and vomiting. His pulse is 91/min and blood pressure is 135/82 mm Hg. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? (B) Aortic dissection (E) Splenic rupture (A) Pancreatic ductal injury (C) Abdominal compartment syndrome (D) Diaphragmatic rupture
Reason: The patient's symptomatology after the motorcycle accident, particularly the development of upper abdominal pain, fever, poor appetite, and vomiting several days post-injury, suggests a complication related to abdominal trauma. Given the mechanism of injury involving high-speed impact and the pattern of pain and systemic symptoms occurring days later, a pancreatic ductal injury is a strong possibility, as such injuries can lead to delayed complications like pancreatitis or pancreatic leaks.

Question: A 56-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his neighbor 2 hours after ingesting an unknown substance in a suicide attempt. He is confused and unable to provide further history. His temperature is 39.1°C (102.3°F), pulse is 124/min, respiratory rate is 12/min, and blood pressure is 150/92 mm Hg. His skin is dry. Pupils are 12 mm and minimally reactive. An ECG shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for this patient's condition? (A) Sodium bicarbonate (E) Flumazenil (D) Glucagon (B) Physostigmine (C) N-acetylcysteine
Reason: The symptoms presented by the patient, including confusion, dilated pupils, and dry skin, suggest anticholinergic toxicity, which can occur following the ingestion of anticholinergic substances. Physostigmine is a reversible inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase that can be used to counteract the effects of anticholinergic agents by increasing the availability of acetylcholine, thus alleviating symptoms.

Question: A 45-year-old man comes to the physician for a routine health maintenance examination. He feels well. He underwent appendectomy at the age of 25 years. He has a history of hypercholesterolemia that is well controlled with atorvastatin. He is an avid marathon runner and runs 8 miles per day four times a week. His father died of myocardial infarction at the age of 42 years. The patient does not smoke or drink alcohol. His vital signs are within normal limits. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. His abdomen is soft and nontender with a surgical scar in the right lower quadrant. Laboratory studies are within normal limits. An ECG is shown. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? (C) Mobitz type I AV block (B) Mobitz type II AV block (E) First-degree AV block (A) Third-degree AV block (D) Atrial fibrillation
Reason: The patient's history does not indicate any prior symptoms of significant heart problems, and the routine examination, including a normal ECG, suggests a potential benign conduction abnormality. Mobitz type I AV block, also known as Wenckebach, is characterized by progressive lengthening of the PR interval followed by a dropped QRS complex, which can be a common finding in asymptomatic individuals and doesn't typically indicate severe underlying heart disease, making it a plausible diagnosis in this context.

Question: A 38-year-old man comes to the physician because of an 8-month history of upper abdominal pain. During this period, he has also had nausea, heartburn, and multiple episodes of diarrhea with no blood or mucus. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for the past 18 years. He does not use alcohol or illicit drugs. Current medications include an antacid. The abdomen is soft and there is tenderness to palpation in the epigastric and umbilical areas. Upper endoscopy shows several ulcers in the duodenum and the upper jejunum as well as thick gastric folds. Gastric pH is < 2. Biopsies from the ulcers show no organisms. Which of the following tests is most likely to confirm the diagnosis? (C) Urine metanephrine levels (B) Fasting serum gastrin level (D) Urea breath test (A) 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring (E) Serum vasoactive intestinal polypeptide level
Reason: The patient presents with symptoms and findings consistent with peptic ulcers, particularly in the setting of thick gastric folds and very low gastric pH, which raises suspicion for Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (gastrinoma). Measuring the fasting serum gastrin level is the most appropriate test to confirm this diagnosis, as elevated gastrin levels would indicate inappropriate gastrin secretion, which leads to excessive gastric acid production and multiple ulcers.
Answer: (B) Fasting serum gastrin level

Question: Five days after undergoing an open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, a 68-year-old woman has crampy abdominal pain. During this period, she has also had two episodes of loose, bloody stools. Her surgery was complicated by severe blood loss requiring the administration of vasopressors and multiple transfusions. Cefazolin was administered as a perioperative antibiotic. The patient has hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and coronary artery disease. The patient has smoked 2 packs of cigarettes daily for 50 years and drinks 3–4 glasses of wine every week. Her current medications include hydrochlorothiazide, atorvastatin, amlodipine, aspirin, and metoprolol. She appears ill. Her temperature is 38.0°C (100.4°F), pulse is 110/min, and blood pressure is 96/58 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a distended abdomen with absent bowel sounds. The abdomen is exquisitely tender to palpation in all quadrants. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination shows an S4 gallop. An x-ray of the abdomen shows air-filled distended bowel. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? (E) Abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture (B) Postoperative ileus (A) Abdominal compartment syndrome (D) Ischemic colitis (C) Pseudomembranous colitis
Reason: The symptoms presented by the patient, including crampy abdominal pain and episodes of loose, bloody stools after significant blood loss and vasopressor use, suggest inadequate blood supply to the intestines, leading to ischemic colitis. The presence of abdominal tenderness, distension, and signs of distress, along with the history of poor perfusion during surgery, further support the diagnosis of ischemic colitis over the other options, which are less consistent with her clinical presentation.

Question: A 27-year-old man is witnessed falling off his bicycle. The patient rode his bicycle into a curb and hit his face against a rail. The patient did not lose consciousness and is ambulatory at the scene. There is blood in the patient's mouth and one of the patient's teeth is found on the sidewalk. The patient is transferred to the local emergency department. Which of the following is the best method to transport this patient's tooth? (D) Wrapped in sterile gauze (E) Wrapped in gauze soaked in normal saline (B) Submerged in normal saline (A) Submerged in milk (C) Submerged in water
Reason: The best method to transport an avulsed tooth is to submerge it in milk because milk contains nutrients and maintains the viability of the periodontal ligament cells, which are crucial for potential re-implantation. Unlike water, which can damage these cells, and normal saline, which does not have the same nutrient composition, milk provides a suitable environment to preserve the tooth's health until it can be treated by a dental professional.
Answer: (A) Submerged in milk

Question: An 83-year-old man presents to the gastroenterologist to follow-up on results from a biopsy of a pancreatic head mass, which the clinician was concerned could be pancreatic cancer. After welcoming the patient and his wife to the clinic, the physician begins to discuss the testing and leads into delivering the results, which showed metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Before she is able to disclose these findings, the patient stops her and exclaims, "Whatever it is, I don't want to know. Please just make me comfortable in my last months alive. I have made up my mind about this." Which of the following is the most appropriate response on the part of the physician? (C) "If you don't know what condition you have, I will be unable to be your physician going forward" (D) "The cancer has spread to your liver" (A) "If that is your definite wish, then I must honor it" (E) "Please, sir, I strongly urge you to reconsider your decision" (B) "As a physician, I am obligated to disclose these results to you"
Reason: The answer is (A) "If that is your definite wish, then I must honor it" because it respects the patient's autonomy and wishes regarding his care at the end of life. In discussions about serious medical conditions, it is essential for healthcare providers to acknowledge and honor the patient's preferences, especially when they express a desire to focus on comfort rather than aggressive treatment. This aligns with the principles of patient-centered care and informed consent.

Question: A 22-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after he was impaled by a metal rod during a work accident. The rod went into his back around the level of T9 but was removed before arrival. He has no past medical history and does not take any medications. On physical examination, he has significant muscle weakness in his entire left lower body. He also exhibits impaired vibration and proprioception in his left leg as well as loss of pain and temperature sensation in his right leg. Which of the following sections of the spinal cord was most likely damaged in this patient? (A) Anterior cord (C) Left hemicord (D) Posterior cord (B) Central cord (E) Right hemicord
Reason: The clinical findings are consistent with Brown-Sequard syndrome, characterized by ipsilateral weakness (left lower body) and loss of proprioception and vibration sense due to damage to the left side of the spinal cord, as well as contralateral loss of pain and temperature sensation (right leg) due to interruption of the spinothalamic tract. This pattern of symptoms indicates that the left hemicord of the spinal cord was most likely damaged by the impalement injury.

[INFO] Opinion paths:
Path 1: Let's analyze the scenario step by step. The patient has a mid-systolic murmur that radiates to the carotids, which suggests the possibility of aortic stenosis.

When the patient is instructed to stand from a supine position, several hemodynamic changes occur due to the effects of gravity and the decreased venous return to the heart:

1. **Venous Return**: Standing reduces venous return to the heart because blood pools in the lower extremities. This leads to decreased preload.
2. **Cardiac Output**: With decreased preload, the cardiac output may decrease, which can affect the pressures in the heart.
3. **Right Atrial Pressure**: Decreasing venous return generally leads to a decrease in right atrial pressure, not an increase.
4. **Left Ventricular End-Diastolic Pressure (LVEDP)**: A decrease in preload due to standing would lead to a decrease in LVEDP.
5. **Pulmonary Capillary Wedge Pressure (PCWP)**: This would also decrease due to the reduced left atrial pressure from decreased left ventricular filling.
6. **Diastolic Filling Time**: Standing may lead to a reduction in diastolic filling time because the heart rate may increase in response to standing (to compensate for decreased stroke volume).
7. **Pacemaker Potential**: The slope of the pacemaker potential is influenced by autonomic tone, not directly by the maneuver of standing.

Based on all of this analysis, the most accurate answer to the question regarding the changes that would occur when the patient stands from a supine position is:

**(E) A reduction in diastolic filling time.**
Path 2: Let's analyze the question step by step. The patient has a mid-systolic murmur that suggests aortic stenosis, which is characterized by a narrowing of the aortic valve, leading to changes in hemodynamics.

When the patient moves from a supine position to standing, several physiological changes occur:

1. **Venous Return:** Standing decreases venous return to the heart due to the pooling of blood in the lower extremities.
2. **Preload:** The reduction in venous return leads to a decrease in preload (the volume of blood in the ventricles at the end of diastole).
3. **Cardiac Output:** As preload decreases, cardiac output can also decrease, which may lead to changes in blood pressure and heart rate.
4. **Compensatory Mechanisms:** The body compensates through increases in heart rate and contractility, but these adjustments can be limited in patients with conditions like aortic stenosis.

Now let's evaluate the answer choices based on these physiological changes:

(A) **An increase in right atrial pressure** - This is unlikely, as the decrease in venous return would typically lead to a decrease in right atrial pressure.

(B) **An increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure** - This is also unlikely because a decrease in preload would lead to a decrease in left ventricular end-diastolic volume and pressure.

(C) **An increase in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure** - This would be unlikely, as a decrease in preload typically leads to a decrease in wedge pressure.

(D) **A reduction in diastolic filling time** - This could happen due to an increase in heart rate as a compensatory mechanism when standing, but it’s not the most direct response to the maneuver.

(E) **A reduction in the slope of the pacemaker potential** - This doesn't directly relate to the standing maneuver.

Given all these considerations, the most direct effect of standing would be a decrease in preload and consequently decreased left ventricular filling pressures. However, of the options given, (A) and (B) seem less likely.

The best choice, considering the context of the maneuver and the physiological changes involved, would be:

**Answer: (E) A reduction in diastolic filling time.** 

This choice reflects the increase in heart rate and decrease in diastolic filling time that can occur when a person stands up.
Path 3: Let's analyze the question step by step:

1. The patient is a 47-year-old executive with a mid-systolic murmur that radiates to the carotids, which is typical of aortic stenosis.
2. The maneuver described is having the patient stand up from a supine position. This maneuver typically decreases venous return to the heart due to the effects of gravity.
3. When a person stands up, the blood pools in the lower extremities, leading to a decrease in preload (the volume of blood in the ventricles at the end of diastole).
4. A decrease in preload would lead to a reduction in left ventricular end-diastolic volume and pressure, rather than an increase.
5. The reduction in venous return and preload can also affect the heart rate and stroke volume.

Now, evaluating the options:
- (A) An increase in right atrial pressure: This is unlikely as venous return decreases.
- (B) An increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure: This is also unlikely as it would decrease with standing.
- (C) An increase in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure: This would likely not occur due to reduced preload.
- (D) A reduction in diastolic filling time: This is true as the heart rate may increase with standing, but it’s not the most direct consequence of the maneuver.
- (E) A reduction in the slope of the pacemaker potential: This is more related to intrinsic heart rate modulation rather than the changes associated with standing.

The most direct and relevant consequence of standing up in this scenario is a reduction in preload, which would affect diastolic filling time.

Therefore, the most appropriate answer would be:
**(D) A reduction in diastolic filling time.**
Path 4: Let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. **Patient Profile**: The patient is a 47-year-old executive with an unremarkable physical examination except for a mid-systolic murmur in the 2nd left intercostal space that radiates to the carotids. This could suggest aortic stenosis.

2. **Maneuver**: The physician instructs the patient to stand from a supine position while auscultating the heart. When a person stands up, several hemodynamic changes occur.

3. **Physiological Changes upon Standing**:
   - When a person stands, there is a shift of blood volume away from the thoracic cavity to the lower extremities due to gravity. This can lead to decreased venous return to the heart.
   - Consequently, there is a decrease in preload (the volume of blood in the ventricles at the end of diastole), which affects the left ventricle.

4. **Effects on Hemodynamics**:
   - A decrease in preload will lead to a decrease in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) because there is less blood filling the left ventricle.
   - There may also be a decrease in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) due to reduced left atrial pressure, as the left ventricle is less full.

Now let's review the options given:

(A) An increase in right atrial pressure - This is unlikely since standing typically decreases venous return and right atrial pressure.

(B) An increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure - This is also unlikely; it would decrease due to reduced preload.

(C) An increase in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure - This is unlikely; it would decrease with reduced left atrial pressure.

(D) A reduction in diastolic filling time - This is not directly related to the maneuver of standing itself.

(E) A reduction in the slope of the pacemaker potential - This relates to the heart rate and would not be expected from simply standing.

Given the above analysis, none of the options seem to describe the expected physiological change accurately. However, based on the context of the question and common physiological responses, the most relevant and notable change would be a reduction in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (though it's not listed as a choice).

Thus, if we strictly adhere to the options presented, the best option related to the expected change upon standing would be:

(B) An increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure.

However, please note that this option is misleading based on physiological understanding, as standing would actually decrease LVEDP. The options provided may not fully capture the expected physiological changes accurately.
Path 5: Let's think step by step. The patient has a mid-systolic murmur that radiates to the carotids, which is characteristic of aortic stenosis. When a patient stands from a supine position, there are several hemodynamic changes that occur:

1. **Decreased venous return**: Standing reduces venous return to the heart because of the effects of gravity. This leads to a decrease in preload.

2. **Effects on cardiac filling pressures**: With the decrease in venous return, there will be a decrease in left ventricular end-diastolic volume, which subsequently leads to a decrease in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP).

3. **Right atrial pressure**: The right atrial pressure is likely to decrease as well due to reduced venous return.

4. **Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure**: This is a reflection of left atrial pressure and would also decrease due to lower left ventricular filling pressures.

5. **Diastolic filling time**: While standing might lead to some reduction in diastolic filling time due to increased heart rate, the primary effect here is related to preload changes.

Considering these points, the most relevant answer in the context of the changes occurring with the maneuver of standing is:

**(B) An increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure** — This is incorrect as it actually decreases due to reduced preload.

None of the other options accurately capture the expected changes in this scenario. Therefore, the answer does not appear to fit any of the provided options because the expected change is a decrease in LVEDP, not an increase. 

However, if we must choose from the given options, and based on the maneuver leading to a reduction in diastolic filling time, option (D) could be the closest as it implies a change in heart dynamics due to standing, although it's not a direct consequence of standing itself. 

Therefore, more context would be needed to clarify this question, but the best conclusion is that standing leads to decreased preload and therefore would not lead to an increase in pressures or filling times related to the heart. 

If you are looking for a definitive answer, it would be:

**(A) An increase in right atrial pressure** — This is incorrect as it should decrease.

So, none of these answers completely fits the expected physiological changes when the patient stands.
Path 6: Let's think through the scenario step by step. 

The patient has a mid-systolic murmur that radiates to the carotids, which suggests the possibility of aortic stenosis. When the patient stands from a supine position, several hemodynamic changes occur due to the effects of gravity and the resulting venous return to the heart. 

1. **Standing from Supine Position**: When a person stands up, there is a transient decrease in venous return to the heart due to pooling of blood in the lower extremities. This can lead to a decrease in stroke volume and cardiac output initially.

2. **Effects on Pressure Measurements**:
   - **Right Atrial Pressure**: This may not significantly change immediately with standing, as there is often a compensatory increase in heart rate.
   - **Left Ventricular End-Diastolic Pressure (LVEDP)**: This typically decreases due to reduced preload from decreased venous return.
   - **Pulmonary Capillary Wedge Pressure (PCWP)**: This usually reflects left atrial pressure and is likely to decrease as well due to reduced left ventricular filling.
   - **Diastolic Filling Time**: Standing can lead to a reduction in diastolic filling time due to increased heart rate, but this is more about the duration of filling rather than filling pressures.
   - **Slope of the Pacemaker Potential**: This does not directly relate to the changes caused by standing.

Given the options, the most relevant change associated with standing from a supine position is:

**(A) An increase in right atrial pressure** – due to the transient decrease in venous return and the body’s compensatory mechanisms which may cause some changes in pressures.

However, there's likely a misunderstanding in the analysis because the right atrial pressure typically doesn't increase significantly with standing; it may decrease depending on the individual's compensatory responses.

Considering the typical cardiovascular responses, the most accurate answer in the context of the options provided and the physiological changes expected would be:

**(E) A reduction in diastolic filling time** - because standing can lead to an increased heart rate which reduces the time the heart has to fill during diastole. 

Final answer: **(E) A reduction in diastolic filling time**.
Path 7: Let's analyze the question step by step. 

The patient has a mid-systolic murmur that radiates to the carotids, which suggests the presence of aortic stenosis. This condition can lead to changes in hemodynamics depending on the patient's position.

When the patient stands from a supine position, it typically leads to a decrease in venous return to the heart. This change can affect various pressures in the cardiovascular system.

1. **Right Atrial Pressure:** This would generally decrease due to reduced venous return when standing.
2. **Left Ventricular End-Diastolic Pressure (LVEDP):** This would also decrease due to the reduced preload when the patient stands.
3. **Pulmonary Capillary Wedge Pressure (PCWP):** This would decrease with reduced left atrial pressure due to decreased preload.
4. **Diastolic Filling Time:** Standing can lead to a reduction in diastolic filling time due to increased heart rate, which is a compensatory response.
5. **Slope of the Pacemaker Potential:** This is more related to autonomic tone and may not significantly change with standing.

Considering these points, the most relevant change that occurs when a patient stands from a supine position is **(E) A reduction in diastolic filling time** due to the increase in heart rate as a compensatory mechanism for decreased venous return.

Therefore, the answer is: **(E) A reduction in diastolic filling time**.
Path 8: Let's analyze the scenario step by step.

The patient has a mid-systolic murmur that is characteristic of aortic stenosis, which often presents with a murmur that radiates to the carotids. The maneuver of standing from a supine position typically leads to a decrease in venous return to the heart due to gravity, which results in changes to the hemodynamics of the heart.

1. **Standing from Supine**: When a person stands, there is a transient decrease in venous return to the heart due to the pooling of blood in the lower extremities, which can lead to a decrease in preload.

2. **Effect on Right Atrial Pressure**: With decreased venous return, right atrial pressure would typically decrease, not increase.

3. **Effect on Left Ventricular End-Diastolic Pressure**: A decrease in preload would also lead to a decrease in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure.

4. **Effect on Pulmonary Capillary Wedge Pressure**: This pressure reflects left atrial pressure, which would also decrease with reduced venous return.

5. **Effect on Diastolic Filling Time**: Standing could potentially reduce diastolic filling time due to a faster heart rate in response to lower venous return and compensatory mechanisms, but primarily it affects the preload.

6. **Effect on Pacemaker Potential**: The pacemaker potential is influenced by autonomic input and is not directly affected by postural changes.

Based on these points, while the changes in hemodynamics occur, the most relevant change to note in the context of this question is:

**Answer: (E) A reduction in diastolic filling time.**

This is due to the potential compensatory increase in heart rate and decrease in filling time associated with the maneuver of standing.
Path 9: Let's analyze the situation step by step.

The patient has a mid-systolic murmur that radiates to the carotids, which suggests aortic stenosis. The maneuver in question involves the patient standing from a supine position, which can affect hemodynamics by decreasing venous return to the heart.

When the patient stands up, several changes occur:

1. **Venous return decreases**: Upon standing, blood pools in the lower extremities, leading to a decrease in the amount of blood returning to the heart.
2. **Preload decreases**: This reduction in venous return results in decreased preload (the volume of blood in the ventricles at the end of diastole).
3. **Cardiac output may decrease**: With reduced preload, cardiac output can decrease, leading to potential compensatory mechanisms.

Now, let's assess the options:

(A) **An increase in right atrial pressure**: This is unlikely to happen; instead, right atrial pressure may decrease due to reduced venous return.

(B) **An increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure**: This is also unlikely; it would more likely decrease due to decreased preload.

(C) **An increase in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure**: This would generally decrease due to the lowered preload.

(D) **A reduction in the slope of the pacemaker potential**: This is not directly related to the changes happening during the maneuver.

(E) **A reduction in diastolic filling time**: This could occur because of the decreased preload and the heart's attempt to maintain cardiac output, leading to a more rapid heart rate to compensate for the lower stroke volume.

In this context, the most appropriate answer is:

**(E) A reduction in diastolic filling time.**
Path 10: Let's analyze the question step by step.

The patient is being assessed for a mid-systolic murmur that radiates to the carotids, which is suggestive of aortic stenosis. Performing the maneuver of standing from a supine position will lead to changes in preload and afterload due to the effects of gravity and changes in venous return.

1. **Standing from Supine**: When a person stands up, venous return to the heart decreases due to the effects of gravity. This leads to a decrease in preload, which is the volume of blood in the ventricles at the end of diastole.

2. **Effects on Cardiac Pressures**: With decreased preload, the left ventricular end-diastolic volume decreases, which in turn leads to a decrease in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP), not an increase.

3. **Other Pressures**: 
   - Right atrial pressure (RAP) would likely decrease due to decreased venous return.
   - Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) would also decrease with decreased left atrial pressure and left ventricular filling.
   - Diastolic filling time may be reduced because of the decreased preload, but this is primarily an effect on the diastolic phase rather than a direct measure of pressures.
   - The slope of the pacemaker potential is primarily related to heart rate and does not directly correlate with changes in posture.

Given these considerations, the correct answer for this situation when the patient stands up is: 

**(A) An increase in right atrial pressure** is incorrect because it would decrease. 

**(B) An increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure** is incorrect because it would decrease. 

**(C) An increase in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure** is incorrect because it would decrease.

**(D) A reduction in diastolic filling time** is a possibility but not the most direct answer regarding changes in pressures.

**(E) A reduction in the slope of the pacemaker potential** is unrelated to the changes from standing.

After reviewing all options, the most direct and relevant change in pressures that would occur with standing would actually lead to a **(A) An increase in right atrial pressure**.

However, since standing typically leads to a decrease in right atrial pressure, none of the answers explicitly state that, indicating a potential misalignment in answer choices. 

In summary, the best answer considering the decrease in preload would be **(A) An increase in right atrial pressure**, but please note that this is counterintuitive based on standard physiological responses.
[INFO] Final decision by majority voting
After reviewing the various reasoning paths and their conclusions, the most consistent answer across the majority of the paths is:

**(E) A reduction in diastolic filling time.**

This conclusion is supported by the following points:

1. **Decreased Venous Return**: Most paths agree that standing from a supine position leads to decreased venous return due to blood pooling in the lower extremities.
2. **Decreased Preload**: The decrease in venous return results in decreased preload, which is a common point across the paths.
3. **Compensatory Mechanisms**: The body compensates for decreased preload by increasing heart rate, which can lead to a reduction in diastolic filling time.
4. **Pressure Changes**: While there is some disagreement about the specific changes in pressures (e.g., right atrial pressure, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure), the consensus is that diastolic filling time is affected by the increased heart rate.

Thus, the majority of the reasoning paths support the conclusion that the most relevant change when the patient stands from a supine position is a reduction in diastolic filling time. Therefore, the final decision is:

**(E) A reduction in diastolic filling time.**

Question: A 27-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his friends in a confused state. He was doing fine 5 days ago when he started to complain of fever and flu-like symptoms. His fever was low-grade and associated with a headache. For the past 2 days, he has become increasingly irritable, confused, and was getting angry at trivial things. Past medical history is unremarkable. He is a college student and is physically active. He smokes cigarettes occasionally. He drinks alcohol socially. He is sexually active with his girlfriend and they use condoms inconsistently. Physical examination reveals: blood pressure 120/80 mm Hg, heart rate 108/min, respiratory rate 10/min, and temperature 37.4°C (99.4°F). He is confused and disoriented. Pupils are 3 mm in diameter and respond to light sluggishly. He is moving all his limbs spontaneously. His neck is supple. MRI of the brain is shown in the picture. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) reveals an opening pressure of 16 cm of H20, a total leukocyte count of 112/mm3 with 85% lymphocytes, the protein of 42 mg/dL, and glucose of 58 mg/dL. What is the best treatment for this condition? (A) Acyclovir (E) Rituximab (B) Ceftriaxone (D) Intravenous immunoglobulin (C) High-dose steroids
Reason: The best treatment for this condition is Acyclovir, which is indicated for viral infections such as herpes simplex encephalitis, particularly given the patient's symptoms of confusion, fever, and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showing a lymphocytic pleocytosis. The results suggest a viral etiology, and Acyclovir targets the herpes simplex virus, making it the appropriate choice in this clinical scenario.

Question: A 36-year-old woman presents with a whitish vaginal discharge over the last week. She also complains of itching and discomfort around her genitals. She says her symptoms are getting progressively worse. She has been changing her undergarments frequently and changed the brand of detergent she uses to wash her clothes, but it did not resolve her problem. Additionally, she admits to having painful urination and increased urinary frequency for the past one month, which she was told are expected side effects of her medication. The patient denies any recent history of fever or malaise. She has 2 children, both delivered via cesarean section in her late twenties. Past medical history is significant for hypertension and diabetes mellitus type 2. Current medications are atorvastatin, captopril, metformin, and empagliflozin. Her medications were changed one month ago to improve her glycemic control, as her HbA1c at that time was 7.5%. Her vital signs are a blood pressure of 126/84 mm Hg and a pulse of 78/min. Her fingerstick glucose is 108 mg/dL. Pelvic examination reveals erythema and mild edema of the vulva. A thick, white, clumpy vaginal discharge is seen. The vaginal pH is 4.0. Microscopic examination of a KOH-treated sample of the discharge demonstrates lysis of normal cellular elements with branching pseudohyphae. Which of the following is the next best step in the management of this patient? (E) Start fluconazole. (B) Stop empagliflozin. (C) Advise her to drink lots of cranberry juice. (D) Switch her from oral antidiabetic medication to insulin. (A) Start metronidazole.
Reason: The next best step in the management of this patient is to start fluconazole, as her symptoms and the presence of branching pseudohyphae on microscopic examination of the discharge are indicative of a Candida yeast infection. Fluconazole is an effective antifungal medication that will help treat the underlying infection, providing relief from her symptoms of itching, discomfort, and abnormal discharge.
Answer: (E) Start fluconazole.

Question: During an experiment conducted to alter the infectivity of common viruses that affect humans, an investigator successfully increases the host range of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The new strain of the virus can infect fibroblast-like cells in addition to the usual target of HIV. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for the increase in the host range of the virus? (C) Increased rate of budding out of host cells (E) Excessive activity of viral RNA polymerase (B) Point mutations in the hemagglutinin gene (A) Mutation of the gene coding for viral surface glycoproteins (D) Reassortment of genetic material between segments of two viruses
Reason: The answer is (A) Mutation of the gene coding for viral surface glycoproteins. This is supported because the surface glycoproteins of a virus are crucial for its ability to recognize and bind to host cell receptors. Changes in these proteins can allow the virus to expand its target range to different cell types, such as fibroblast-like cells, which may not normally be susceptible to infection by the standard strain of HIV.
Answer: (A) Mutation of the gene coding for viral surface glycoproteins

Question: A 30-year-old woman comes to the physician for a pelvic examination and Pap smear. Menses have occurred at regular 28-day intervals since menarche at the age of 11 years and last for 5 days. The first day of her last menstrual period was 3 weeks ago. She is sexually active with her husband and takes oral contraceptive pills. Her last Pap smear was 3 years ago. She has never had a mammography. Her mother and maternal aunt died of breast cancer. Pelvic examination shows a normal vagina and cervix. Bimanual examination shows a normal-sized uterus and no palpable adnexal masses. Which of the following health maintenance recommendations is most appropriate at this time? (B) Pap smear and human papillomavirus testing now and every year, mammography at age 65 (E) Pap smear and human papillomavirus testing now and every 5 years, mammography at age 40 (A) Pap smear and human papillomavirus testing now and every year, mammography at age 40 (D) Pap smear only every year, mammography at age 50 (C) Pap smear every 5 years, mammography at age 40
Reason: The answer is (E) Pap smear and human papillomavirus testing now and every 5 years, mammography at age 40. This is supported by current guidelines, which recommend that women aged 21 to 29 receive Pap smears alone every 3 years, and those aged 30 to 65 undergo Pap smear testing in combination with HPV testing every 5 years. Additionally, given her family history of breast cancer, it is advised that she begin mammography earlier at age 40 for more effective screening.

Question: A 45-year-old male is brought to the emergency department by emergency medical services after sustaining a gunshot wound to the abdomen. He is unresponsive. His temperature is 99.0°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 95/58 mmHg, pulse is 115/min, and respirations are 20/min. Physical examination reveals an entry wound in the left abdominal quadrant just inferior to the left lateral costal border. Abdominal CT suggests that the bullet is lodged in a retroperitoneal structure. Which of the following structures has the bullet most likely penetrated? (C) Ascending colon (E) Sigmoid colon (D) Superior duodenum (B) Transverse colon (A) Descending colon
Reason: The answer is (A) Descending colon. This conclusion is supported by the location of the entry wound, which is in the left abdominal quadrant. The descending colon, being located in the left side of the abdomen, is more likely to be penetrated by a bullet in this area compared to the other structures listed, particularly because the bullet is suggested to be lodged in a retroperitoneal structure, which aligns with injury to the descending colon as part of the posterior abdominal cavity.
Answer: (A) Descending colon

Question: A 49-year-old man presents to the clinic for evaluation of puncture wounds on the dorsal aspect of his right second and third metacarpals. He states that he was in a fight 3 nights ago and he struck another individual in the mouth. The patient’s medical history is significant for peripheral vascular disease and hypertension. He takes aspirin, sulfasalazine, and lisinopril. He is allergic to penicillin. He drinks socially on weekends and smokes one and one-half packs of cigarettes daily. Vitals of the patient are as follows: blood pressure is 142/88 mm Hg; heart rate is 88/min; respiratory rate is 14/min; temperature is 38.9°C (102.1°F). On physical examination, the patient appears alert and oriented. His BMI is 33 kg/ m². His eyes are without scleral icterus. His right orbital region reveals ecchymosis along the superior and inferior borders. His heart is regular in rhythm and rate without murmurs. Capillary refill is 4 seconds in fingers and toes. His right dorsal second and third metacarpal region reveals two 3 mm lacerations with edema. Which of the following is the most appropriate management strategy for this patient? (D) Doxycycline with irrigation and debridement (A) Azithromycin with irrigation and debridement (E) Irrigation and debridement (C) Clindamycin plus doxycycline with irrigation and debridement (B) Amoxicillin-clavulanate with irrigation and debridement
Reason: The patient's puncture wounds, especially considering the fight and potential exposure to oral flora, put him at risk for bacterial infections, specifically from bacteria typically found in the mouth, such as Streptococcus and Staphylococcus species. Clindamycin would be effective against anaerobic bacteria that might be involved, while doxycycline can provide coverage against both aerobic and anaerobic organisms, making this combination appropriate in managing possible polymicrobial infections associated with human bites or puncture wounds from fights.
Answer: (C) Clindamycin plus doxycycline with irrigation and debridement

Question: A 6-month-old boy is brought to the pediatrician for multiple swellings on his scalp. His mother reports that she first noticed 3 softened and swollen areas over the child's scalp 2 months ago that have grown in size. The child is also urinating more frequently than usual. He was born by cesarean section at 39 weeks gestation. The mother had appropriate prenatal care. She has a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease for which she takes omeprazole. Her family history is unknown as she was adopted at a young age. The boy's temperature is 99°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 100/60 mmHg, pulse is 110/min, and respirations are 20/min. On exam, he has 3 areas of soft tissue swelling on his skull that are tender to palpation. Moderate asymmetric exophthalmos is noted. A water deprivation test is performed which demonstrates a urine specific gravity of 1.005. The urine specific gravity rises with desmopression administration. A head computerized tomography (CT) scan is performed which demonstrates multifocal lytic calvarial lesions. A biopsy of one of the lesions is performed. Analysis of the biopsy would most likely reveal which of the following findings? (B) B cells with hair-like cytoplasmic projections (C) Cytoplasmic azurophilic granules forming needle-like structures (A) Atypical lymphocytes with cerebriform nuclei (D) Proliferative monoclonal plasma cells (E) Rod-shaped granules with a latticed matrix
Reason: The clinical presentation of the 6-month-old boy, including the multifocal lytic calvarial lesions, moderate asymmetric exophthalmos, and findings from the water deprivation test suggesting diabetes insipidus, may indicate Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH). In LCH, the biopsy typically reveals characteristic "birbeck" granules, which are rod-shaped granules with a latticed matrix that are indicative of Langerhans cells, supporting the diagnosis of LCH and aligning with the patient's clinical signs.
Answer: (E) Rod-shaped granules with a latticed matrix

Arterial blood gas shows a pH of 7.29 and pCO2 of 28. Chemistry panel shows: Na+ 136, Cl- 100, HCO3- 14. CBC is significant for a significant leukocytosis with bandemia. The laboratory reports that blood cultures are growing gram positive cocci.

Which of the following is true about this patient's biochemical state? (D) Increased activity of isocitrate dehydrogenase (B) Decreased activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase (C) Decreased activity of lactate dehydrogenase (E) Increased flux through the electron transport chain (A) Increased activity of alcohol dehydrogenase
Reason: The answer is (B) Decreased activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase. In a state of sepsis, which is indicated by this patient's fever, tachycardia, and positive blood cultures, the body often shifts its metabolism to anaerobic pathways due to tissue hypoperfusion and a lack of sufficient oxygen.

Question: A previously healthy 6-week-old infant is brought to the emergency department because of fever, fatigue, and dry cough for one day. She has been feeding poorly and had difficulty latching on to breastfeed since yesterday. She has had nasal congestion. The mother reports that her daughter has not been going through as many diapers as usual. She was born by uncomplicated vaginal delivery at 42 weeks' gestation. Her mother is a cystic fibrosis carrier. The patient has been treated with acetaminophen for the last 24 hours, and vitamin D drops since birth. She appears irritable, pale, and lethargic. She is at the 25th percentile for both length and weight; she had the same percentiles at birth. Her temperature is 38.2°C (100.7°F) and respirations are 64/min. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 92%. Examination shows an ill-appearing infant with a cough and nasal flaring. Mucous membranes are dry. Chest examination shows intercostal and supraclavicular retractions. Expiratory wheezes are heard on auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely causal organism? (A) Listeria monocytogenes (C) Rhinovirus (E) Streptococcus pneumoniae (B) Respiratory syncytial virus (D) Coronavirus
Reason: The answer is (B) Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) because this infant presents with symptoms consistent with bronchiolitis, a lower respiratory tract infection that commonly occurs in young children, particularly those under six months of age. The combination of cough, wheezing, respiratory distress, and the age of the infant make RSV the most likely causative agent, as it is a leading cause of respiratory illness in infants and can lead to hypoxia, as indicated by the low oxygen saturation of 92%.
Answer: (B) Respiratory syncytial virus

Question: A 51-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of diffuse perineal and scrotal pain. On a 10-point scale, he rates the pain as a 5 to 6. He reports that during this time he also has pain during ejaculation and dysuria. He did not have fever. The pain is persistent despite taking over-the-counter analgesics. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 20 years. He appears healthy and well nourished. Vital signs are within normal limits. Abdominal and scrotal examination shows no abnormalities. Rectal examination shows a mildly tender prostate without asymmetry or induration. Laboratory studies show:
Hemoglobin 13.2 g/dL
Leukocyte count 5000/mm3
Platelet count 320,000/mm3
Urine
RBC none
WBC 4-5/hpf
A urine culture is negative. Analysis of expressed prostatic secretions shows 6 WBCs/hpf (N <10). Scrotal ultrasonography shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?" (E) Bladder neck cancer (D) Chronic epididymitis (C) Chronic pelvic pain syndrome (A) Prostatic abscess (B) Benign prostatic hyperplasia
Reason: The answer is (C) Chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS), as the patient exhibits symptoms consistent with this condition, including perineal and scrotal pain, pain during ejaculation, and dysuria, without evidence of infection or other structural abnormalities. The presence of mild tenderness upon rectal examination and the low white blood cell count in prostatic secretions suggest inflammation rather than a bacterial or acute infection, aligning with the diagnosis of CPPS, particularly type III, which does not involve detectable infection but presents with pelvic pain.
Answer: (C) Chronic pelvic pain syndrome

Question: A 43-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a painless ulcer on the sole of her right foot. There is no history of trauma. She has been dressing the ulcer once daily at home with gauze. She has a 15-year history of poorly-controlled type 1 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Current medications include insulin and lisinopril. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows a 2 x 2-cm ulcer on the plantar aspect of the base of the great toe with whitish, loose tissue on the floor of the ulcer and a calloused margin. A blunt metal probe reaches the deep plantar space. Sensation to vibration and light touch is decreased over both feet. Pedal pulses are intact. An x-ray of the right foot shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial step in management? (C) Intravenous antibiotic therapy (B) Amputation of the right forefoot (D) Sharp surgical debridement of the ulcer (A) Total contact casting of right foot (E) Surgical revascularization of the right foot
Reason: The most appropriate initial step in managing this patient's foot ulcer is sharp surgical debridement. This is indicated because the ulcer presents with necrotic tissue, as suggested by the whitish, loose tissue observed, and debridement can help promote healing, reduce the risk of infection, and prevent complications associated with chronic wounds, especially in patients with diabetes.

Question: A 77-year-old female comes to a medical school's free clinic for follow-up examination after a urinary tract infection (UTI) and is seen by a fourth year medical student. The clinic serves largely uninsured low-income patients in a New York City neighborhood with a large African American and Latino population. Two weeks ago, the patient was treated in the local emergency department where she presented with altered mental state and dysuria. The medical student had recently read about a study that described a strong relationship between cognitive impairment and UTI hospitalization risk (RR = 1.34, p < 0.001). The attending physician at the medical student's free clinic is also familiar with this study and tells the medical student that the study was conducted in a sample of upper middle class Caucasian patients in the Netherlands. The attending states that the results of the study should be interpreted with caution. Which of the following concerns is most likely underlying the attending physician's remarks? (E) Selection bias (C) Poor reliability (A) Confounding bias (B) Low internal validity (D) Low external validity
Reason: The attending physician's concerns are most likely related to low external validity, as the study was conducted in a specific population of upper middle-class Caucasian patients in the Netherlands. This raises questions about the generalizability of the findings to different populations, such as the low-income, diverse demographic seen in the clinic, where factors like socioeconomic status, ethnicity, and access to healthcare might influence UTI hospitalization risk differently.

Question: A 4-year-old girl is brought to the emergency department by her mother after a fall in the park. Her mother reports a history of spontaneous frequent falls and delayed development for which calcium and iron supplementations were prescribed by their family physician. She has been on antibiotic therapy for the last 2 days for an unremitting cough. Her vital signs include: blood pressure 110/60 mm Hg, pulse 98/min, temperature 38.0°C (100.4°F), and respiratory rate 18/min. On examination, there is tenderness over the femur which later turns out to be due to a fractured femoral neck. Moreover, systemic examination reveals red eyes with dilated, tortuous conjunctival blood vessels. Abnormal limb movements are also observed. Which of the following is expected to exceed the normal range in this patient? (D) α- fetoprotein (A) Lymphocytes (E) Random blood glucose (B) Immunoglobulin A (IgA) (C) Serum calcium
Reason: The scenario presented suggests a condition that could be associated with liver dysfunction or a tumor, particularly in a young child with developmental delays and skin changes indicating possible systemic involvement. In cases of liver disease or certain types of tumors, such as hepatoblastoma, α-fetoprotein (AFP) levels are often markedly elevated, making it the expected value to exceed normal limits in this patient.

Question: A 22-year-old man presents with a history of lightheadedness, weakness, and palpitations when he assumes an upright position from a supine position. He is otherwise a healthy man without a history of alcohol or other substance abuse. His supine and standing blood pressures (measured at 3-minute intervals) were 124/82 mm Hg and 102/72 mm Hg, respectively. He was advised to perform a Valsalva maneuver while monitoring blood pressure and heart rate to assess the integrity of his baroreflex control. Which of the following statements is correct? (A) Phases III and IV are mediated by baroreceptor reflexes that require intact efferent parasympathetic responses (C) During early phase II, there is an increase in blood pressure and a decrease in heart rate (B) During late phase II, there is an increase in both blood pressure and heart rate (E) The Valsalva ratio is defined as the maximum phase II bradycardia divided by the minimum phase IV tachycardia (D) During phase I, the blood pressure decreases due to increased intrathoracic pressure
Reason: The Valsalva maneuver is characterized by distinct phases that reflect changes in blood pressure and heart rate due to altered intrathoracic pressure affecting venous return and baroreceptor activity. During late phase II, as the intrathoracic pressure normalizes and venous return improves, the compensatory responses from the autonomic nervous system lead to an increase in both blood pressure and heart rate, making statement B the correct choice.
Answer: (B) During late phase II, there is an increase in both blood pressure and heart rate

[INFO] Opinion paths:
Path 1: Let's analyze the question step by step. The patient is a 39-year-old African-American woman with hip pain, and she has a history of sarcoidosis. The key aspects of her presentation include:

1. **Localized hip pain and groin pain**: Suggestive of a possible joint or bone issue.
2. **Progressively worsening pain**: Indicates that the condition may be serious.
3. **Physical exam findings**: Pain with manipulation but no restriction of range of motion.

Given her history of sarcoidosis, one potential concern could be avascular necrosis (AVN) of the hip, which can occur in patients with this condition, often due to corticosteroid use or the disease itself.

Now, considering the imaging options provided:
- **CT of the hip (A)**: Useful for detailed anatomical imaging but not the most sensitive for early bone changes.
- **Radiograph of the hip (C)**: Good for detecting advanced changes but may not show early AVN.
- **Ultrasound of the hip (E)**: Can be useful for soft tissue evaluation but is not standard for bone assessment.
- **MRI of the hip (B)**: Highly sensitive for detecting early changes in AVN and other bone marrow pathologies.
- **Radionuclide scan of the hip (D)**: Useful for detecting increased bone metabolism but is not as specific or sensitive for detecting early AVN compared to MRI.

Considering these points, the most sensitive test for assessing conditions like avascular necrosis or other bone marrow pathology in this context would be an **MRI of the hip**.

Therefore, the best answer to the question is:
**(B) MRI of the hip**.
Path 2: To determine the most sensitive test for this patient's condition, we need to consider her clinical presentation and the potential underlying issues related to her history of sarcoidosis. 

Given the hip pain localized to the left hip and groin, along with her history of sarcoidosis, there is a concern for possible osteonecrosis (avascular necrosis) of the hip, which can occur in patients with chronic glucocorticoid use or other underlying conditions.

Now, let's evaluate the options in terms of sensitivity for detecting such conditions:

- **(A) CT of the hip**: Good at visualizing bony structures and can show changes in the bone, but not as sensitive for soft tissue changes.
- **(C) Radiograph of the hip**: Initial imaging often used, but it may not show early changes in osteonecrosis.
- **(E) Ultrasound of the hip**: Useful for assessing soft tissue and fluid collections but not optimal for bone pathology.
- **(B) MRI of the hip**: Highly sensitive for detecting early changes of osteonecrosis, including marrow changes and edema.
- **(D) Radionuclide scan of the hip**: Can show areas of increased metabolic activity but is not as specific or sensitive for early osteonecrosis compared to MRI.

Considering these points, the most sensitive test for detecting osteonecrosis or other subtle changes in the hip joint associated with her symptoms and history is:

**Answer: (B) MRI of the hip**.
Path 3: Let's analyze the case step by step. The patient is a 39-year-old African-American woman with a history of sarcoidosis, presenting with localized left hip and groin pain that has progressively worsened over two weeks. The physical examination indicates pain with manipulation but no restriction of range of motion in the hip.

Given the clinical scenario, we are likely considering a condition such as avascular necrosis (AVN) of the hip, which can be associated with conditions like sarcoidosis. In this context, the most sensitive imaging modality for detecting early changes in avascular necrosis is an MRI of the hip. MRI can reveal changes in the bone marrow and other soft tissue structures that indicate AVN earlier than other imaging modalities.

Now, let's evaluate the options:

(A) CT of the hip - Useful for visualizing bony structures but not as sensitive as MRI for early changes.

(B) MRI of the hip - **Most sensitive for detecting avascular necrosis** and early changes in the hip joint.

(C) Radiograph of the hip - Initial imaging can show changes but may miss early disease.

(D) Radionuclide scan of the hip - Can indicate increased metabolic activity but is less specific and sensitive than MRI.

(E) Ultrasound of the hip - Useful for soft tissue evaluation but not the best for bone pathology.

Based on this analysis, the most sensitive test for this condition is:

**Answer: (B) MRI of the hip.**
Path 4: Let's analyze the clinical scenario step by step. 

The patient is a 39-year-old African-American woman with a history of sarcoidosis presenting with localized hip and groin pain. Given her history and the nature of the pain, which has been progressively worsening, we should consider the possibility of avascular necrosis (AVN) of the femoral head, particularly in the context of her underlying condition (sarcoidosis can be associated with AVN).

In terms of diagnostic imaging for avascular necrosis, MRI is considered the most sensitive test. It can detect early changes in the bone marrow and soft tissue that are not visible on X-rays or CT scans. MRI can identify areas of edema and changes indicative of AVN before the structural changes occur.

While CT scans and ultrasound can be useful in certain cases, MRI provides the best sensitivity for detecting early avascular necrosis.

Therefore, the most sensitive test for this condition is:
**Answer: (B) MRI of the hip.**
Path 5: Let's analyze the situation step by step.

The patient is a 39-year-old African-American woman with a history of sarcoidosis, presenting with localized left hip and groin pain that has been progressively worsening over the past two weeks. The pain is aggravated by manipulation of the hip, but there is no restriction of range of motion, which suggests a possible underlying condition rather than a mechanical issue.

Given her history and the nature of the pain, one possibility that should be considered is avascular necrosis (AVN) of the hip, particularly because sarcoidosis can be associated with conditions that lead to AVN. 

Now let's evaluate the imaging options:

- **CT of the hip (A)**: While CT can provide detailed images of the bone, it's not the most sensitive for early detection of AVN.
- **Radiograph of the hip (C)**: X-rays are often the first step in imaging but may not show early AVN.
- **Ultrasound of the hip (E)**: This is useful for assessing effusions or soft tissue, but not the best for bone pathology.
- **MRI of the hip (B)**: MRI is the most sensitive test for detecting early changes associated with AVN and can show changes in the bone marrow before structural changes occur.
- **Radionuclide scan of the hip (D)**: This can detect increased blood flow to the area but is less specific than MRI.

Considering these options, the **MRI of the hip (B)** would be the most sensitive test for detecting avascular necrosis or other potential underlying bone pathology in this patient.

Therefore, the answer is:
**(B) MRI of the hip**.
Path 6: To determine the most sensitive test for hip pain in this patient, we need to consider the potential conditions that could be causing her symptoms, particularly in the context of her recent diagnosis of sarcoidosis.

Sarcoidosis can cause a variety of musculoskeletal symptoms, including arthritis and osteitis. Given the patient's age, sex, and ethnic background, conditions such as avascular necrosis (AVN) of the hip could also be a consideration, especially if she has been on corticosteroids for her sarcoidosis.

Let’s evaluate the options:

- (A) CT of the hip: While CT can provide detailed images of the hip joint and surrounding structures, it is not the most sensitive initial test for conditions like AVN.
- (B) MRI of the hip: MRI is highly sensitive for detecting early changes in bone marrow edema and other abnormalities associated with AVN and other hip pathologies.
- (C) Radiograph of the hip: X-rays are often the first step in evaluating hip pain, but they may not detect early changes in conditions like AVN.
- (D) Radionuclide scan of the hip: This can indicate areas of increased metabolic activity but is less commonly used for specific hip pain evaluation.
- (E) Ultrasound of the hip: This can be useful for evaluating soft tissue structures and effusions but is not typically the most sensitive test for bony conditions.

Given that MRI is the most sensitive modality for detecting early changes in conditions affecting the hip, such as avascular necrosis or other inflammatory changes, the answer is:

**Answer: (B) MRI of the hip**
Path 7: Let's analyze the situation step by step.

The patient is a 39-year-old African-American woman with a history of sarcoidosis, presenting with localized hip and groin pain that has been progressively worsening over two weeks. The physical exam reveals pain with manipulation but no restriction of range of motion. Given her background and symptoms, the differential diagnosis could include conditions such as avascular necrosis (AVN) of the hip, particularly related to corticosteroid use for sarcoidosis, or osteoarthritis, among others.

To determine the most sensitive test for evaluating hip conditions, we need to consider the imaging modalities:

1. **CT of the hip**: This provides detailed images of bone and can be helpful but is not the most sensitive for early changes in soft tissue or bone marrow abnormalities.
  
2. **Radiograph of the hip**: Standard X-rays are often the first-line imaging, but they may not be sensitive to early changes in conditions like AVN.
  
3. **Ultrasound of the hip**: This can be useful for evaluating effusions but is not typically the best choice for bone or deep tissue abnormalities.
  
4. **MRI of the hip**: MRI is highly sensitive to changes in bone marrow and soft tissue, making it excellent for detecting early avascular necrosis and other conditions affecting the hip joint.
  
5. **Radionuclide scan of the hip**: This can identify areas of increased metabolic activity in the bone but is less commonly used and not as specific as MRI.

Given the clinical scenario and the need for sensitivity in detecting underlying bony or soft tissue pathology, the most appropriate and sensitive test for this patient's condition would be:

**Answer: (B) MRI of the hip**.
Path 8: To determine the most sensitive test for the condition presented, let's analyze the situation step by step.

The patient has a history of sarcoidosis and presents with hip pain that has been progressively worsening. Given the context, we should consider the potential causes of hip pain in a patient with sarcoidosis, which may include osteonecrosis (avascular necrosis) or inflammatory conditions that could affect the hip joint.

1. **CT of the hip (A)**: While a CT scan can provide detailed images of the hip joint and surrounding structures, it is not the most sensitive test for detecting early changes in conditions like osteonecrosis.

2. **Radiograph of the hip (C)**: X-rays are often the first imaging studies performed, but they may not show early changes associated with osteonecrosis.

3. **Ultrasound of the hip (E)**: Ultrasound can evaluate effusions and some soft tissue structures, but it is not typically used as the first-line imaging for osteonecrosis or inflammatory conditions of the hip.

4. **MRI of the hip (B)**: MRI is the most sensitive imaging modality for detecting early changes of osteonecrosis. It can show bone marrow edema and other changes before they become apparent on X-rays or CT scans.

5. **Radionuclide scan of the hip (D)**: While bone scans can show increased uptake in cases of osteonecrosis, they are generally less specific and not as sensitive as MRI for early detection.

Given this analysis, the most sensitive test for detecting conditions like osteonecrosis in this clinical context would be:

**Answer: (B) MRI of the hip**
Path 9: Let's analyze the situation step by step.

The patient is a 39-year-old African-American woman with hip pain and a history of sarcoidosis. The key points to note are:

1. **Pain Localization**: The pain is localized to the left hip and groin, and it has been progressively worsening over the past two weeks.
2. **Physical Examination**: There is pain with manipulation of the hip but no restriction of range of motion, which suggests that there may be an underlying issue that is not purely mechanical.
3. **History of Sarcoidosis**: Sarcoidosis can lead to various musculoskeletal manifestations, including arthritis or osteitis.

Given this context, there is a concern for possible underlying conditions, such as avascular necrosis (AVN) of the hip, which can be associated with sarcoidosis.

Now, regarding the options for testing:

- **CT of the hip (A)**: Good for visualizing bony structures but not as sensitive for early changes.
- **Radiograph of the hip (C)**: Useful for initial assessment but may not show early changes in conditions like AVN.
- **Ultrasound of the hip (E)**: Typically not used for diagnosing AVN or similar conditions.
- **MRI of the hip (B)**: The most sensitive test for early detection of avascular necrosis and other bone marrow edema changes.
- **Radionuclide scan of the hip (D)**: Can indicate increased metabolic activity but is less specific than MRI.

Based on this analysis, the most sensitive test for detecting conditions such as avascular necrosis in this patient would be:

**Answer: (B) MRI of the hip**.
Path 10: Let's analyze the situation step by step.

The patient presents with hip pain, localized to the left hip and groin, with a history of sarcoidosis. While the pain is intense, there is no restriction of range of motion, and the physical exam shows pain with manipulation.

When considering diagnostic imaging for joint or bone conditions, particularly looking for potential osteonecrosis (which can occur in patients with sarcoidosis due to corticosteroid use) or other conditions affecting the hip joint, the sensitivity of the imaging modality is crucial.

1. **Radiograph of the hip (C)**: This is often the first imaging modality used for hip pain, but it may not reveal early changes in conditions such as osteonecrosis.
  
2. **CT of the hip (A)**: This can provide more detailed images of the bone but is not as sensitive as MRI for soft tissue and early bone changes.
  
3. **Ultrasound of the hip (E)**: This can be useful for evaluating fluid collections or effusions but is not the most sensitive test for detecting bone marrow changes or early osteonecrosis.
  
4. **MRI of the hip (B)**: MRI is the most sensitive test for detecting early changes in the bone marrow associated with conditions like osteonecrosis. It can show changes that are not visible on X-rays or CT scans, making it the preferred imaging modality in this context.
  
5. **Radionuclide scan of the hip (D)**: While this can be sensitive for detecting bone pathology, it is less specific compared to MRI.

Given the context of the patient's history and the need for sensitivity in detecting potential osteonecrosis or other bone pathologies, the most sensitive test for assessing this condition would be:

**Answer: (B) MRI of the hip**

Question: A retrospective study was conducted in a US county in order to determine the frequency of hypodontia (tooth agenesis), the most common craniofacial malformation in humans, as well as to assess the need for an interdisciplinary approach to managing subsequent functional and esthetic sequelae in a target population. Using a dental administration computer software tool, a total of 1498 patients who visited the outpatient clinic of a large specialist dental center between April 2017 and February 2018 were identified. The group comprised 766 women and 732 men. Hypodontia was found in 6.3% of the patients, a rate that was consistent with the average values found in the published medical literature. Which measure of frequency was used to describe the percentage of patients affected by hypodontia in this example? (C) Cumulative incidence (D) Incidence rate (B) Period prevalence (A) Point prevalence (E) Attack rate
Reason: Period prevalence refers to the proportion of individuals in a population who have a particular condition during a specific time frame. In this example, the study reports the percentage of patients with hypodontia over the period of the study (April 2017 to February 2018), which fits the definition of period prevalence, as it encompasses all cases within that specific timeframe.

Question: A 70-year-old man presents for a routine checkup. He says that he recently completely lost hearing in both ears and has been having occasional flare-ups of osteoarthritis in his hands and hips. Past medical history is significant for hypertension diagnosed 25 years ago that is well controlled. Family history is significant for his brother, who recently died from prostate cancer. The patient's blood pressure is 126/84 mm Hg. Laboratory findings are significant for an alkaline phosphatase level that is more than 3 times the upper limit. Right upper quadrant ultrasound and non-contrast computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis reveal no significant abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely complication of this patient’s condition? (C) Osteoid osteoma (A) Pulmonary metastasis (B) Cushing syndrome (E) Osteosarcoma (D) Hypoparathyroidism
Reason: The elevated alkaline phosphatase levels in this 70-year-old man, combined with his sudden hearing loss and the absence of significant abdominal findings, may suggest a condition related to abnormal bone metabolism. Osteosarcoma is a potential complication associated with elevated alkaline phosphatase levels, particularly in older adults, as it can indicate increased bone turnover and is more prevalent in individuals with underlying bone pathology.

In the emergency department, her blood pressure is found to be 150/100 mm Hg, pulse is 88/min, respiratory rate is 30/min, and temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F). Her records show that her blood pressure was the same yesterday during her regular antenatal visit. Chest auscultation reveals bilateral crackles along the lung base. Abdominal examination reveals a gravid uterus consistent with a gestational age of 32 weeks and a floating fetus in a cephalic presentation. Pelvic examination is performed which shows a closed firm cervix with no evidence of bleeding or discharge. Moderate pitting edema is noted and neurologic examination shows generalized hyperreflexia. Laboratory findings are significant for the following:
Hemoglobin 12.5 g/dL
Platelets 185,000/μL
Serum creatinine 0.4 mg/dL
Spot urine creatinine 110 mg/dL
Spot urine protein 360 mg/dL
AST 40 IU/L
Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient? (C) Preeclampsia without severe features (A) HELLP syndrome (D) Eclampsia (E) Gestational hypertension (B) Preeclampsia with severe features
Reason: The patient's symptoms and findings, including severe headache, elevated blood pressure readings of 150/100 mm Hg, proteinuria (360 mg/dL), and signs of edema, suggest a significant hypertensive disorder of pregnancy. The presence of these symptoms alongside elevated blood pressure and proteinuria indicates that she meets the diagnostic criteria for preeclampsia with severe features, particularly because she exhibits symptoms that may indicate end-organ dysfunction, including her headache and hyperreflexia.
Answer: (B) Preeclampsia with severe features

Question: A 4-year-old boy presents to the emergency department after his parents found him drinking blue liquid out of an unlabeled bottle in the garage. They have no idea what was in the bottle and are concerned for his health. They have brought the bottle with them to the emergency department. The child's past medical history is not remarkable, and he is currently not taking any medications. The patient's vitals are within normal limits for his age. Physical exam reveals a crying child who is drooling. A radiograph is performed, and the child's vitals are closely monitored. It is determined that the blue liquid is a strong alkali. Which of the following is the best next step in management? (E) Ipecac (D) Gastrografin swallow and endoscopy (C) Charcoal (B) Administration of a weak acid (A) Administration of a diluent
Reason: In cases of strong alkali ingestion, the priority is to assess the extent of damage to the esophagus and gastrointestinal tract, which can be severe due to the corrosive nature of alkalis. Performing a Gastrografin swallow study followed by endoscopy allows for visualization and evaluation of any injury, ensuring appropriate management and treatment can be initiated based on the findings.
Answer: (D) Gastrografin swallow and endoscopy

Question: A 28-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1, at 31 weeks gestation is admitted to the hospital because of regular contractions and pelvic pressure for 3 hours. Her pregnancy has been uncomplicated so far. She has attended many prenatal appointments and followed the physician's advice about screening for diseases, laboratory testing, diet, and exercise. She has no history of fluid leakage or bleeding. Her previous pregnancy was complicated by a preterm delivery at 34 weeks gestation. She smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for 10 years before pregnancy and has smoked 4 cigarettes daily during pregnancy. At the hospital, her temperature is 37.2°C (99.0°F), blood pressure is 108/60 mm Hg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 16/min. Cervical examination shows 2 cm dilation with intact membranes. Fetal examination shows no abnormalities. A cardiotocography shows a contraction amplitude of 220 montevideo units (MVU) in 10 minutes. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy at this time? (E) Terbutaline + Oxytocin (B) Magnesium sulfate + Betamethasone (C) Oxytocin + Magnesium sulfate (D) Progesterone + Terbutaline (A) Betamethasone + Progesterone
Reason: In a patient with preterm labor, particularly one with a previous history of preterm delivery, the administration of magnesium sulfate can be beneficial for neuroprotection of the fetus, while betamethasone is important for promoting fetal lung maturity. Together, these medications support the best outcomes by addressing both the immediate risk of preterm birth and the long-term health of the premature infant.
Answer: (B) Magnesium sulfate + Betamethasone

Question: A medical student is performing research on the properties of viruses in order to determine the transmission patterns of various organisms. He accidentally drops a rack of tubes and spills various virus samples on the benchtop. Upon seeing this, the laboratory technician wipes down the workbench with alcohol in order to clean up the spill. Which of the following organisms would most likely still be alive after this cleaning? (E) Coronavirus and rhinovirus (B) Adenovirus and herpesvirus (D) Coronavirus and herpesvirus (C) Adenovirus and rhinovirus (A) Adenovirus and coronavirus
Reason: To determine which organisms would likely survive alcohol cleaning, it's important to consider their structural properties and resistance to disinfectants. Adenoviruses and rhinoviruses are both non-enveloped viruses, which generally exhibit greater stability and resistance to environmental stressors, including alcohol, compared to enveloped viruses. Thus, after the alcohol wipe, it is plausible that adenoviruses and rhinoviruses could still remain viable.

Question: A 72-year-old man presents to his primary care physician due to worsening headache and double vision. His headache began several months ago, and he describes them as sharp and localized to the left side of the head. His double vision began one week prior to presentation. Medical history is significant for hypertension and type II diabetes mellitus, which is treated with lisinopril and metformin. He smokes a pack of cigarettes a day for the last 40 years. His temperature is 98.3°F (37°C), blood pressure is 148/84 mmHg, pulse is 60/min, and respirations are 14/min. On physical exam, a mild head turning towards the left is appreciated. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light, with a more pronounced esotropia on left-lateral gaze. The rest of the neurologic exam is otherwise normal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head and MR angiography shows a left-sided intracavernous carotid aneurysm. Which of the following nerves is most likely compressed by the aneurysm in this patient? (D) Trochlear (B) Ophthalmic (A) Oculomotor (E) Optic (C) Abducens
Reason: The abducens nerve (cranial nerve VI) controls lateral eye movement by innervating the lateral rectus muscle, and it is particularly susceptible to compression from structures in the cavernous sinus, such as a carotid aneurysm. In this scenario, the patient's symptoms of double vision and left head turn, alongside the evidence of a left-sided intracavernous carotid aneurysm, suggest that the abducens nerve is being compressed, leading to the observed esotropia on left-lateral gaze.
Answer: (C) Abducens

Question: A 30-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by the police after starting a fight at a local bar. He has several minor bruises and he appears agitated. He talks incessantly about his future plans. He reports that he has no history of disease and that he is "super healthy" and "never felt better". His temperature is 38.0°C (100.4°F), pulse is 110/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 155/80 mm Hg. On physical examination reveals a euphoric and diaphoretic man with slightly dilated pupils. An electrocardiogram is obtained and shows tachycardia with normal sinus rhythm. A urine toxicology screen is positive for cocaine. The patient is held in the ED for observation. Which of the following symptoms can the patient expect to experience as he begins to withdraw from cocaine? (C) Lacrimation (D) Psychosis (B) Increased sympathetic stimulation (A) Increased appetite (E) Seizures
Reason: Cocaine withdrawal can lead to a variety of symptoms that reflect a rebound effect after cessation of the drug. Among these, increased appetite is a common symptom as individuals may experience significant cravings for food and other substances as the body's reward pathways readjust in the absence of cocaine, which is known to suppress appetite while active. Other withdrawal symptoms may include fatigue, depression, and difficulty concentrating, further supporting the likelihood of increased appetite during this phase.
Answer: (A) Increased appetite

Question: A 9-year-old boy is brought to his primary care physician after his mom noticed that he was limping. He says that he has been experiencing significant hip and knee pain over the last 2 months but thought he may have just strained a muscle. Radiographs show a collapse of the femoral head, and he is diagnosed with Legg-Calve-Perthes disease. He undergoes surgery and is placed in a Petrie cast from his hips to his toes bilaterally so that he is unable to move his knees or ankles. Eight weeks later, the cast is removed, and he is found to have significantly smaller calves than before the cast was placed. Which process in myocytes is most likely responsible for this finding? (C) Inhibition of gene transcription (B) Increased formation of double membrane bound vesicles (E) Polyubiquitination of proteins (A) Decreased formation of double membrane bound vesicles (D) Monoubiquitination of proteins
Reason: The process most likely responsible for the finding of significantly smaller calves after being in a Petrie cast is polyubiquitination of proteins. In the context of muscle atrophy, prolonged immobilization leads to muscle disuse, which activates the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. This pathway tags proteins within the muscle fibers for degradation, resulting in reduced muscle mass and the observed smaller calves.
Answer: (E) Polyubiquitination of proteins

Question: A 46-year-old man is brought to the emergency department for the onset of severe pain in his right knee that occurred when he tripped while descending a staircase. As he landed, he heard and felt an immediate popping sensation in his right knee. His medical history is positive for obesity, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, severe asthma, and hyperlipidemia. He currently takes lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, metformin, atorvastatin, an albuterol inhaler, and a fluticasone inhaler. He recently completed a hospitalization and week-long regimen of systemic corticosteroids for a severe exacerbation of his asthma. The patient’s family history is not significant. In the emergency department, his vital signs are normal. On physical examination, his right knee is warm and swollen and he rates the pain as 9/10. He cannot stand or walk due to pain. He is unable to extend his right leg or flex his right thigh. A knee X-ray is ordered. Which of the following would best describe the cause of this presenting condition? (B) Femoral fracture (D) Avascular necrosis of the femur (E) Traction apophysitis of the tibia (A) Meniscal tear (C) Quadriceps tendon tear
Reason: The presenting condition is best described as a quadriceps tendon tear, which is supported by the patient's mechanism of injury (landing from a trip), the immediate popping sensation, and the inability to extend the leg. These symptoms align with the classic presentation of a quadriceps tendon injury, especially given his inability to perform specific movements and his severely limited function in the knee.

Question: An 80-year-old man is admitted to the hospital after the sudden onset of sub-sternal chest pain and shortness of breath while sitting in a chair. He has hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for 42 years. Four days after admission, he becomes tachycardic and then loses consciousness; the cardiac monitor shows irregular electrical activity. Cardiac examination shows a new systolic murmur at the apex. Despite appropriate measures, he dies. Microscopic evaluation of the myocardium is most likely to show which of the following? (B) Wavy myocardial fibers without inflammatory cells (E) Hyperemic granulation tissue with abundance of macrophages (C) Low cellularity with dense, non-contractile scar tissue (D) Dense granulation tissue with collagenous scar formation (A) Coagulative necrosis with dense neutrophilic infiltrate
Reason: The correct answer is (E) Hyperemic granulation tissue with abundance of macrophages because the patient likely experienced an acute myocardial infarction (MI), leading to ischemic injury and subsequent healing processes. After several days post-MI, hyperemic granulation tissue can form as part of the repair phase, characterized by new blood vessel formation and the presence of macrophages assisting in the cleanup and healing of the damaged myocardial tissue.

Question: A 34-year-old woman presents with blurred vision and ringing in her ears. She says she has a 6-month history of recurrent worsening bilateral pulsatile headaches that she manages with ibuprofen, which does very little to relieve the pain. For the past week, she says she has vomited nearly every morning and missed work due to the pain in her head. She first noticed vision problems 3 months ago that has occurred several times since then. Past medical history is significant for uncomplicated urinary tract infection for which she has just finished a course of antibiotics. She has a history of a mild urticarial reaction when she takes penicillin. Her vital signs include: blood pressure 115/74 mm Hg, pulse 75/min, and respiratory rate 16/min. Her body mass index (BMI) is 36 kg/m2. Physical examination is significant for bilateral peripheral visual field loss with preservation of visual acuity. Fundoscopic examination reveals blurring of the disc margins with vessel tortuosity. The remainder of her physical examination is unremarkable. A magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the brain is normal. Lumbar puncture (LP) is remarkable for a markedly elevated opening pressure. Which of the following is the next best step in the treatment of her condition? (B) Counseling for weight loss (A) Furosemide (E) Ventriculoperitoneal shunting (D) Optic nerve sheath fenestration (C) Acetazolamide
Reason: Acetazolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor commonly used to reduce intracranial pressure and is often the first-line treatment for idiopathic intracranial hypertension, which is consistent with the symptoms and findings of this patient, such as headaches, visual field loss, and elevated opening pressure during lumbar puncture. Given the patient's obesity and symptoms suggestive of increased intracranial pressure, acetazolamide would address the underlying pathophysiology effectively.

Question: A 70-year-old man presents to the clinic with right-sided chest pain and difficulty breathing for the past 10 days. When it began, the pain was mild, but as time went on, it increased to a level at which the man found it difficult to breathe. Two years ago, he was diagnosed with clear cell carcinoma of the kidney. Vital signs include: pulse rate is 72/min, blood pressure is 122/80 mm Hg, respiratory rate is 16/min, and temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F). On physical examination, the trachea appears to have deviated to the left, respiratory movements are diminished, there is decreased resonance on percussion, and there is an absence of breath sounds over the right hemithorax. Which of the following is the most likely clinical diagnosis in this patient? (C) Pneumothorax (A) Pneumonia (E) Pleural effusion (D) Pulmonary embolism (B) Atelectasis
Reason: The clinical presentation of this patient, including difficulty breathing, chest pain, tracheal deviation to the left, diminished respiratory movements, decreased resonance on percussion, and absence of breath sounds over the right hemithorax, suggests a significant accumulation of fluid in the pleural space. These findings are consistent with a pleural effusion, especially in the context of the patient's history of renal cell carcinoma, which can predispose him to this complication due to either malignancy-related processes or treatment effects.

Question: Five minutes after arriving in the postoperative care unit following total knee replacement under general anesthesia, a 55-year-old woman is acutely short of breath. The procedure was uncomplicated. Postoperatively, prophylactic treatment with cefazolin was begun and the patient received morphine and ketorolac for pain management. She has generalized anxiety disorder. Her only other medication is escitalopram. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 25 years. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 108/min, respirations are 26/min, and blood pressure is 95/52 mm Hg. A flow-volume loop obtained via pulmonary function testing is shown. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms? (A) Rupture of an alveolar bleb (E) Type I hypersensitivity reaction (B) Neuromuscular blockade (C) Decreased central respiratory drive (D) Bronchial hyperresponsiveness
Reason: The patient's acute shortness of breath shortly after surgery, combined with her history of smoking and anxiety, suggests a possible allergic reaction, particularly given the context of recent medication administration (cefazolin). Type I hypersensitivity reactions can occur rapidly and may manifest as respiratory distress, which aligns with her acute symptoms postoperatively near the time of medication initiation.

Question: A 48-year-old man and his wife present to a psychologist’s office for a therapy session. He was encouraged to visit the psychiatrist 6 months ago by his wife and they have been meeting with the psychologist several times a month ever since. Initially, she was concerned about behavioral changes she observed after he was passed up for a promotion at work. She felt he was taking on a new personality and was acting like his coworker, who actually did get the promotion. He would also walk about his coworker and praise his intelligence and strategic character. Over the course of several months, the patient bought new clothes that looked like the other man’s clothes. He changed his hairstyle and started using phrases that were similar to his coworker. Today, they both seem well. The patient still does not seem to think there are a problem and requests to stop therapy. His wife was frustrated because her husband recently bought a new car of the exact make and model of his coworker. Which of the following defense mechanisms best describes this patient’s condition? (C) Introjection (B) Conversion (E) Splitting (A) Sublimation (D) Regression
Reason: The best answer is (C) Introjection because the patient is adopting the characteristics, behaviors, and values of his coworker that he admires.

Question: A 70-year-old man comes to the physician because of right-sided back pain, red urine, and weight loss for the last 4 months. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 40 years. A CT scan of the abdomen shows a large right-sided renal mass. Biopsy of the mass shows polygonal clear cells filled with lipids. Which of the following features is necessary to determine the tumor grade in this patient? (C) Degree of mitotic activity (A) Size of malignant proliferation (D) Response to chemotherapy (E) Involvement of regional lymph nodes
" (B) Invasion of surrounding structures
Reason: The degree of mitotic activity is essential for determining tumor grade because it reflects how quickly the cancer cells are dividing and their potential for aggressive growth. A higher mitotic rate often correlates with a poorer prognosis and indicates more aggressive tumor behavior, which is crucial for guiding treatment decisions.
Answer: (C) Degree of mitotic activity

Fewshot exampler #2:
Question: A 31-year-old woman comes to the physician because she thinks that her “right wrist is broken.” She says that she has severe pain and that “the bone is sticking out.” She has not had any trauma to the wrist. Her medical records indicate that she was diagnosed with schizophrenia 2 years ago and treated with olanzapine; she has not filled any prescriptions over the past 4 months. Three weeks ago, she stopped going to work because she “did not feel like getting up” in the morning. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination of the right wrist shows no visible injury; there is no warmth, swelling, or erythema. Range of motion is limited by pain. On mental status examination, she has a flat affect. Her speech is pressured and she frequently changes the topic. She has short- and long-term memory deficits. Attention and concentration are poor. There is no evidence of suicidal ideation. Urine toxicology screening is negative. An x-ray of the wrist shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate response to this patient's concerns? (B) """I understand your concerns; however, your symptoms seem to be psychogical in nature. I would be happy to refer you to a mental health professional.""" (D) “It seems as though you are having a schizophrenia relapse. If you don't follow my recommendations and take your medications, you will most likely have further and possibly more severe episodes.” (A) “I cannot see any injury of your wrist and the physical exam as well as the x-ray don't show any injury. I imagine that feeling as if your wrist was broken may be very uncomfortable. Can you tell me more about what it feels like?” (C) """I can imagine that you are uncomfortable. That certainly looks painful. Let's take care of this injury first and then we should talk about your problems getting up in the morning.""" (E) """You are clearly distressed. However, your tests do not suggest a physical problem that can be addressed with medications or surgery. I suggest that we meet and evaluate your symptoms on a regular basis."""
Reason: The selected response is appropriate because it acknowledges the patient's distress while providing reassurance that no physical injury is evident. By encouraging the patient to discuss her feelings further, the physician can address any underlying psychological issues and facilitate a productive conversation about her mental health, particularly considering her history of schizophrenia.
Answer: (A) “I cannot see any injury of your wrist and the physical exam as well as the x-ray don't show any injury. I imagine that feeling as if your wrist was broken may be very uncomfortable. Can you tell me more about what it feels like?”

Fewshot exampler #3:
Question: A 66-year-old woman presents to the emergency department after a fall 4 hours ago. She was on her way to the bathroom when she fell to the ground and lost consciousness. Although she regained consciousness within one minute, she experienced lightheadedness for almost half an hour. She has experienced on-and-off dizziness for the past 2 weeks whenever she tries to stand. She has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and chronic kidney disease secondary to polycystic kidneys. Her medications include aspirin, bisoprolol, doxazosin, erythropoietin, insulin, rosuvastatin, and calcium and vitamin D supplements. She has a blood pressure of 111/74 mm Hg while supine and 84/60 mm Hg on standing, the heart rate of 48/min, the respiratory rate of 14/min, and the temperature of 37.0°C (98.6°F). CT scan of the head is unremarkable. Electrocardiogram reveals a PR interval of 250 ms. What is the next best step in the management of this patient? (C) Start anti-epileptics (A) Electroencephalogram (B) Holter monitoring (D) Stop antihypertensive medicines (E) Tilt table testing
Reason: The next best step in management is to stop antihypertensive medications because the patient's symptoms of dizziness, lightheadedness upon standing, and hypotension indicate orthostatic hypotension likely exacerbated by her antihypertensive regimen. Given her significantly low blood pressure upon standing (84/60 mm Hg), discontinuing medications that lower blood pressure could help alleviate her symptoms and stabilize her hemodynamics.
Answer: (D) Stop antihypertensive medicines
[INFO] Sampling path 10 completed.
[INFO] Opinion paths:
Path 1: Let's think step by step. 

1. The patient becomes unresponsive shortly after extubation and has significantly low oxygen saturation (73%) despite being on a non-rebreather mask with 100% FiO2.
2. The arterial blood gas analysis shows a low pH (7.32), indicating acidosis, and a low partial pressure of oxygen (PO2 73 mm Hg), confirming hypoxemia.
3. Given the patient's unresponsive state and persistent hypoxemia, it indicates that he is unable to maintain his airway and adequately ventilate.
4. The non-rebreather mask is insufficient in this case, as the patient remains unresponsive and has not improved with supplemental oxygen.

Considering all these factors, the best next step in the management of this patient is to ensure airway protection and adequate ventilation.

Answer: (C) Reintubate
Path 2: Let's analyze the situation step by step. 

1. **Patient Status**: The patient is a 74-year-old man who became unresponsive shortly after extubation following an open cholecystectomy. He has a history of significant comorbidities, including type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease, and a long history of smoking.

2. **Vital Signs**: His vital signs upon becoming unresponsive show a pulse of 102/min, respirations of 20/min, and a blood pressure of 130/80 mm Hg. His oxygen saturation is critically low at 73%.

3. **Arterial Blood Gas Analysis**: The ABG shows:
   - pH 7.32 (acidic)
   - pCO2 33 mm Hg (slightly low)
   - pO2 73 mm Hg (very low)
   - HCO3 22 mEq/L (normal)
   
   This indicates respiratory acidosis with hypoxemia.

4. **Current Management**: The patient is on a non-rebreather mask with an FiO2 of 100%, but he is still unresponsive and his oxygen saturation remains critically low at 73%.

5. **Next Steps**: Given that the patient is unresponsive, has low oxygen saturation, and is not improving with supplemental oxygen, the most appropriate action is to secure the airway. 

The options are:
- (A) Perform tracheostomy: This is not an immediate step in an acute setting.
- (E) Start BiPAP: This may help but is not adequate for someone who is unresponsive and critically hypoxic.
- (C) Reintubate: This is necessary to secure the airway and provide adequate ventilation.
- (D) Close observation only: This is not appropriate given the patient's critical condition.
- (B) Continue using the non-rebreather mask: This is ineffective as the patient remains unresponsive and hypoxic.

Given the urgency of the situation, the best next step in management is:

Answer: (C) Reintubate
Path 3: Let's analyze the situation step by step.

1. **Patient Status**: The 74-year-old man became unresponsive shortly after extubation following an open cholecystectomy. He has a history of multiple comorbidities (type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease, hypertension) and has been a heavy smoker.

2. **Current Vital Signs**: His oxygen saturation is critically low at 73%, even after being placed on a non-rebreather mask with 100% oxygen. This indicates severe hypoxemia.

3. **Arterial Blood Gas (ABG) Analysis**:
   - pH: 7.32 (acidosis)
   - PCO2: 33 mm Hg (respiratory alkalosis or compensated metabolic acidosis)
   - PO2: 73 mm Hg (hypoxemia)
   - HCO3: 22 mEq/L (normal range)
   - O2 saturation: 73%

   The low pH indicates that the patient is acidotic, and the low PO2 suggests significant hypoxemia.

4. **Clinical Considerations**: Given the patient's unresponsiveness, severe hypoxemia, and acid-base imbalance, the priority is to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

5. **Options for Management**:
   - (A) **Perform tracheostomy**: This is generally not the immediate step for acute respiratory failure.
   - (B) **Continue using the non-rebreather mask**: This is insufficient given the patient's ongoing severe hypoxemia and unresponsiveness.
   - (C) **Reintubate**: Given the patient's critical state and failure to respond to supplemental oxygen, reintubation is necessary to secure the airway and provide controlled ventilation.
   - (D) **Close observation only**: This is not appropriate given the patient's critical condition.
   - (E) **Start BiPAP**: While BiPAP can be useful in some cases of respiratory failure, the degree of unresponsiveness and hypoxemia suggests that reintubation is more appropriate at this time.

**Conclusion**: The best next step in the management of this patient, given his unresponsiveness and critical hypoxemia, is to **reintubate** him to secure the airway and ensure adequate ventilation and oxygenation.

**Answer: (C) Reintubate**
Path 4: Let's analyze the patient's condition step by step.

1. **Patient Status**: The patient is unresponsive, has low oxygen saturation (73%), and his arterial blood gas shows:
   - pH: 7.32 (acidic, indicating acidosis)
   - PCO2: 33 mm Hg (low, indicating respiratory alkalosis or compensation)
   - PO2: 73 mm Hg (hypoxemia)
   - HCO3: 22 mEq/L (normal, indicating no metabolic compensation)

2. **Clinical Context**: The patient underwent surgery, was extubated, and then became unresponsive shortly thereafter. He has a history of significant health issues including diabetes, coronary artery disease, and recent smoking cessation, which could contribute to complications.

3. **Current Management**: The patient is on a non-rebreather mask with 100% FiO2, but is still hypoxic and unresponsive. His arterial blood gases indicate respiratory distress, and the low pH suggests a significant problem.

4. **Options for Next Steps**:
   - **(A) Perform tracheostomy**: This is an invasive procedure that is not typically the immediate step in an acute situation.
   - **(E) Start BiPAP**: BiPAP could be considered for respiratory support but may not be sufficient given his current status.
   - **(C) Reintubate**: Given the patient's unresponsiveness and severe hypoxemia, reintubation is often necessary to secure the airway and provide adequate ventilation.
   - **(D) Close observation only**: This is inappropriate given the patient's critical condition.
   - **(B) Continue using the non-rebreather mask**: This is unlikely to be effective given that the patient remains unresponsive and hypoxic.

Based on this analysis, the best next step in the management of this patient is to **(C) Reintubate**. This is necessary to ensure proper airway management and ventilation due to the patient's severe respiratory distress and unresponsiveness.
Path 5: Let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. **Patient Details**: The patient is a 74-year-old man who has just undergone an open cholecystectomy and has a history of type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease, and hypertension. He was extubated but became unresponsive shortly thereafter.

2. **Current Vital Signs**: Upon examination, he has an elevated pulse of 102/min and low oxygen saturation (73%) despite being on a non-rebreather mask with 100% FiO2.

3. **Arterial Blood Gas Analysis**: The pH is 7.32, which indicates acidosis, and the PCO2 is 33 mm Hg, suggesting a respiratory compensation. The HCO3 is 22 mEq/L, which is within normal limits. The low PO2 (73 mm Hg) and O2 saturation (73%) indicate significant hypoxemia.

4. **Assessment**: Given that the patient is unresponsive and has markedly low oxygen saturation, this is a medical emergency. The patient is at risk for respiratory failure, and the low oxygen saturation suggests that the current intervention (non-rebreather mask) is insufficient.

5. **Management Options**:
   - (A) **Perform tracheostomy**: This is an invasive procedure not indicated in the acute setting.
   - (B) **Continue using the non-rebreather mask**: This is not appropriate given the ongoing hypoxemia.
   - (C) **Reintubate**: Given the patient's unresponsiveness and severe hypoxemia, reintubation is a critical step to secure the airway and ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
   - (D) **Close observation only**: This is not appropriate given the acute nature of the patient's condition.
   - (E) **Start BiPAP**: While BiPAP can be useful in some cases of respiratory failure, it may not be sufficient for a patient who is unresponsive and unable to protect their airway.

**Conclusion**: The best next step in the management of this patient is to **reintubate** to secure the airway and manage the hypoxemia effectively.

**Answer**: (C) Reintubate
Path 6: Let's think step by step. 

In this scenario, the patient has become unresponsive shortly after extubation, shows significantly decreased oxygen saturation (73%), and has an arterial blood gas (ABG) indicating respiratory acidosis (pH 7.32, PCO2 33 mm Hg) with hypoxemia (PO2 73 mm Hg and O2 saturation 73%). 

Given these findings, the patient is likely experiencing respiratory failure. The provision of supplemental oxygen via a non-rebreather mask has not improved his oxygen saturation, and he remains unresponsive. 

The best next step in management for a patient who is unresponsive and has severely low oxygen saturation is to secure the airway. Reintubation (Answer C) is indicated in this situation to ensure adequate ventilation and oxygenation, especially since he is not responding to non-invasive measures and his condition is critical.

Therefore, the answer is: **(C) Reintubate.**
Path 7: Let's analyze the situation step by step. The patient is a 74-year-old man who became unresponsive shortly after undergoing an open cholecystectomy under general anesthesia. He has a history of several comorbidities, including type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease, and a significant smoking history. 

After extubation, he presents with hypoxemia (oxygen saturation of only 73%) and an arterial blood gas (ABG) showing:
- pH 7.32 (acidic)
- PCO2 33 mm Hg (slightly low)
- PO2 73 mm Hg (low)
- HCO3 22 mEq/L (normal)

The low pH indicates acidosis, and the low oxygen saturation signifies significant hypoxemia. The patient is unresponsive and requires immediate intervention.

Given this information, the best next step in management would be to secure the airway, as he is unable to maintain adequate oxygenation and is unresponsive. 

Reintubation (option C) is indicated in this scenario to ensure that the airway is protected and to provide adequate ventilation and oxygenation. The other options, such as continuing with the non-rebreather mask or using BiPAP, would not adequately address the patient's critical state if he remains unresponsive and unable to protect his airway.

Therefore, the answer is: **(C) Reintubate.**
Path 8: Let's analyze the situation step by step.

1. The patient underwent an open cholecystectomy and was extubated after showing signs of alertness.
2. He became unresponsive shortly after extubation and had a low oxygen saturation of 73%, despite being placed on a non-rebreather mask with 100% FiO2.
3. His blood gas analysis shows:
   - pH 7.32 (acidosis)
   - PCO2 33 mm Hg (slightly low, indicating potential respiratory compensation)
   - PO2 73 mm Hg (hypoxemia)
   - HCO3 22 mEq/L (normal, indicating an acute process)

Given the patient's unresponsiveness, low oxygen saturation, and inadequate response to non-rebreather oxygen, it is clear that he is not maintaining adequate ventilation and oxygenation. 

The best next step in management in this situation is to ensure airway protection and provide adequate ventilation. 

Considering the options:
- (A) Perform tracheostomy: This is not appropriate at this stage.
- (E) Start BiPAP: This may help but is not the most definitive intervention for unresponsiveness and severe hypoxemia.
- (C) Reintubate: This is the most appropriate choice to secure the airway and provide adequate ventilation.
- (D) Close observation only: This is inadequate given the clinical situation.
- (B) Continue using the non-rebreather mask: This is insufficient given the patient's unresponsiveness and hypoxemia.

Therefore, the best next step in management is to (C) Reintubate the patient. 

Answer: (C) Reintubate
Path 9: Let's analyze the situation step by step. 

1. **Patient Presentation**: The 74-year-old man becomes unresponsive shortly after extubation following an open cholecystectomy. He has a history of diabetes, coronary artery disease, and hypertension, and has recently quit smoking. He is currently showing signs of hypoxemia with an oxygen saturation of 73% despite being placed on a non-rebreather mask (FiO2 of 100%).

2. **Vital Signs and ABG Analysis**: 
   - **Vital signs**: Pulse is elevated at 102/min, respirations at 20/min, and blood pressure is stable at 130/80 mm Hg.
   - **Arterial blood gas (ABG)**: The pH is 7.32 (acidic), PCO2 is 33 mm Hg (low), and HCO3 is 22 mEq/L (normal). The pO2 is low at 73 mm Hg.

3. **Interpretation of ABG**: The pH indicates acidemia, and the low pCO2 suggests that the patient is hyperventilating (possibly compensating for the acidosis), but with a low pO2, indicating significant hypoxemia. 

4. **Management Considerations**: Given that the patient is unresponsive and has severely low oxygen saturation, the immediate concern is ensuring adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

5. **Options Evaluation**:
   - **(A) Perform tracheostomy**: This is not indicated as an immediate step in an acute situation.
   - **(E) Start BiPAP**: This could help with oxygenation and ventilation but is not the best immediate step given the patient's level of unresponsiveness.
   - **(C) Reintubate**: This is the most appropriate action given the significant hypoxemia, unresponsiveness, and the need for controlled ventilation and oxygenation.
   - **(D) Close observation only**: Not appropriate given the urgent need for intervention.
   - **(B) Continue using the non-rebreather mask**: This is insufficient given the patient's continued unresponsiveness and low oxygen saturation.

**Conclusion**: The best next step in the management of this patient is to (C) Reintubate.
Path 10: Let's analyze the situation step by step. The patient is a 74-year-old man who became unresponsive shortly after being extubated following an open cholecystectomy. His vital signs show significant hypoxemia with an oxygen saturation of only 73%, and his arterial blood gas analysis indicates respiratory acidosis with a pH of 7.32 and a pCO2 of 33 mm Hg. 

Considering the following points:
- The patient remains unresponsive despite being placed on a non-rebreather mask with 100% oxygen.
- His oxygen saturation continues to be critically low at 73%.
- Given the clinical scenario, the patient is likely experiencing respiratory failure, which is not being adequately addressed by the non-rebreather mask.

In this case, the best next step in management is to secure the airway by reintubating the patient to ensure adequate ventilation and oxygenation. 

Answer: (C) Reintubate

Question: A 20-year-old man presents with a tremor involving his upper limbs for the past 3 weeks. He says his symptoms have been progressively worsening. Past medical history is significant for 2 episodes of undiagnosed jaundice over the last year. No significant family history. His temperature is 36.9°C (98.4°F), the pulse is 82/min, the blood pressure is 116/78 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate is 12/min. On physical examination, there is excessive salivation, and he has an expressionless face. He has an ataxic gait accompanied by asymmetric resting and kinetic tremors. Hepatomegaly is evident. There is a greenish-gold limbal ring in both corneas. After laboratory findings confirm the diagnosis, the patient is prescribed a medication that he is warned may worsen his tremors. The patient is also instructed to return in a week for a complete blood count and urinalysis. Which of the following additional adverse effects may be expected in this patient while taking this medication? (E) Sensorineural deafness (C) Weight gain (D) Myasthenia gravis (A) Pulmonary fibrosis (B) Constipation
Reason: The answer is (D) Myasthenia gravis because the clinical features presented, including tremors, hepatomegaly, and a greenish-gold corneal ring, suggest Wilson's disease, for which the treatment typically involves the use of penicillamine. One of the known adverse effects of penicillamine is the potential onset of autoimmune conditions, including myasthenia gravis, due to its immunosuppressive effects.

Question: A scientist is studying mechanisms by which cancer drugs work to kill tumor cells. She is working to optimize the function of a drug class in order to reduce toxicity and increase potency for the target. After synthesizing a variety of analogs for the drug class, she tests these new pharmacologic compounds against a panel of potential targets. Assay results show that there is significant binding to a clustered group of proteins. Upon examining these proteins, she finds that the proteins add a phosphate group to an aromatic amino acid sidechain. Which of the following disorders would most likely be treated by this drug class? (C) Chronic myeloid leukemia (B) HER2 negative breast cancer (D) Testicular cancer (A) Brain tumors (E) Non-Hodgkin lymphoma
Reason: The answer is (C) Chronic myeloid leukemia because the study describes proteins that add phosphate groups to aromatic amino acids, likely referring to tyrosine kinases, which are key drivers in the pathogenesis of certain cancers, including chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). The most well-known treatment for CML involves tyrosine kinase inhibitors, which specifically target the BCR-ABL fusion protein resulting from the Philadelphia chromosome translocation, effectively reducing the activity of these kinases involved in promoting cancer cell proliferation.

Question: A 45-year-old woman comes to the office with a 2-week history of rectal bleeding that occurs every day with her bowel movements. She denies any pain during defecation. Apart from this, she does not have any other complaints. Her past medical history is insignificant except for 5 normal vaginal deliveries. Her vitals are a heart rate of 72/min, a respiratory rate of 15/min, a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), and a blood pressure of 115/85 mm Hg. On rectovaginal examination, there is a palpable, non-tender, prolapsed mass that can be pushed back by the examiner's finger into the anal sphincter. What is the most likely diagnosis? (C) Rectal ulcer (A) Anal fissure (B) Anorectal fistula (E) Hemorrhoids (D) Proctitis
Reason: The symptoms described in the case, such as rectal bleeding during bowel movements without associated pain and the presence of a palpable, non-tender, prolapsed mass that can be reduced, are characteristic of hemorrhoids. These findings suggest that the bleeding is likely due to engorgement and distension of the hemorrhoidal vessels, leading to bleeding during defecation, rather than other conditions such as anal fissures or rectal ulcers, which would typically accompany pain.
Answer: (E) Hemorrhoids

Her vital signs include: blood pressure 110/60 mm Hg, pulse 98/min, temperature 38.0°C (100.4°F), and respiratory rate 18/min. On examination, there is tenderness over the femur which later turns out to be due to a fractured femoral neck. Moreover, systemic examination reveals red eyes with dilated, tortuous conjunctival blood vessels. Abnormal limb movements are also observed. Which of the following is expected to exceed the normal range in this patient? (C) Serum calcium (B) Immunoglobulin A (IgA) (D) α- fetoprotein (A) Lymphocytes (E) Random blood glucose
Reason: The vignette describes a 4-year-old girl with developmental delays, frequent falls, and a femoral neck fracture, which could indicate bone health issues. The presence of red eyes with dilated conjunctival blood vessels and abnormal limb movements may suggest a potential underlying condition such as a congenital or genetic disorder, which could lead to elevated levels of α-fetoprotein, a protein typically produced by the liver and yolk sac during fetal development, that can be elevated in certain types of tumors or liver dysfunction, as well as in some congenital illnesses.
Answer: (D) α- fetoprotein

Question: A 24-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after he is found sluggish, drowsy, feverish, and complaining about a headache. His past medical history is unremarkable. His vital signs include: blood pressure 120/60 mm Hg, heart rate 70/min, respiratory rate 17/min, and body temperature 39.0°C (102.2°F). On physical examination, the patient is dysphasic and incapable of following commands. Gait ataxia is present. No meningeal signs or photophobia are present. A noncontrast CT of the head is unremarkable. A T2 MRI is performed and is shown in the image. A lumbar puncture (LP) is subsequently performed. Which of the following CSF findings would you most likely expect to find in this patient? (E) Opening pressure: 38 cm H2O, color: cloudy, protein: 75 mg/dL, cell count: 80 cells/µL, mostly lymphocytes, ratio CSF:blood glucose: 0.25 (C) Opening pressure: 40 cm H2O, color: cloudy, protein: 80 mg/dL, cell count: 135 cells/µL, mostly lymphocytes with some PMNs, ratio CSF:blood glucose: 0.2 (D) Opening pressure: 15 cm H2O, color: clear, protein: 50 mg/dL, cell count: 40 cells/µL, mostly lymphocytes, ratio CSF:blood glucose: 0.65 (A) Opening pressure: 18 cm H2O, color: clear, protein: 40 mg/dL, cell count: 2 cells/µL, mostly polymorphonuclear (PMNs), ratio CSF:blood glucose: 0.7 (B) Opening pressure: 28 cm H2O, color: cloudy, protein: 68 mg/dL, cell count: 150 cells/µL, mostly PMNs, ratio CSF:blood glucose: 0.3
Reason: The patient's presentation of fever, altered mental status, dysphasia, and ataxia, along with an unremarkable CT scan and a need for lumbar puncture, suggests a viral or atypical infection, potentially encephalitis, which often presents with lymphocytic pleocytosis and a relatively normal glucose level in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The CSF findings in option (D), which indicate a clear color with a lymphocytic predominance and a reasonably normal glucose level, align with the expected profile for viral infections or mild cases of encephalitis, as opposed to bacterial infections that typically show cloudy CSF with a higher protein count and neutrophilic predominance.
Answer: (D) Opening pressure: 15 cm H2O, color: clear, protein: 50 mg/dL, cell count: 40 cells/µL, mostly lymphocytes, ratio CSF:blood glucose: 0.65

Question: A 29-year-old man presents to his primary care provider after complaining of a rash on his penis. He describes it as small painless growths that have developed over the past several months. They have slowly increased in size over time. His medical history is unremarkable. He has had several sexual partners and uses condoms inconsistently. He describes himself as having generally good health and takes no medication. On physical exam, his vital signs are normal. There are multiple cauliflower-like papular eruptions just under the glans penis. They are tan-pink and raised. Examination of the scrotum, perineum, and anus shows no abnormalities. There is no inguinal lymphadenopathy. The remainder of the physical exam shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial management? (D) Quadrivalent vaccine (C) Laser therapy (B) Interferon ɑ (E) Topical imiquimod (A) Cryotherapy
Reason: Cryotherapy is the most appropriate initial management for this patient with genital warts, likely caused by human papillomavirus (HPV). This treatment effectively reduces warts through localized freezing, and it is a commonly used first-line option for managing such lesions, especially when they are symptomatic or causing concern for the patient.
Answer: (A) Cryotherapy

Question: A 45-year-old man is brought into the emergency department after he was hit by a car. The patient was intoxicated and walked into oncoming traffic. He is currently unconscious and has a Glasgow coma scale score of 3. The patient has been admitted multiple times for alcohol intoxication and pancreatitis. The patient is resuscitated with fluid and blood products. An initial trauma survey reveals minor scrapes and abrasions and pelvic instability. The patient’s pelvis is placed in a binder. After further resuscitation the patient becomes responsive and states he is in pain. He is given medications and further resuscitation ensues. One hour later, the patient complains of numbness surrounding his mouth and in his extremities. Which of the following is the most likely explanation of this patient’s current symptoms? (A) Hypokalemia (E) Trauma to the spinal cord (D) Transfusion complication (B) Late-onset edema surrounding the spinal cord (C) Medication complication
Reason: The most likely explanation for this patient's symptoms of numbness around the mouth and in the extremities is a transfusion complication. Given that he received fluid and blood products during his resuscitation, the onset of neurological symptoms may suggest an allergic reaction or transfusion-related acute lung injury, both of which can lead to altered sensations and neurological signs following a transfusion. Additionally, the timing of the symptoms correlating with transfusion supports this explanation.
Answer: (D) Transfusion complication

Question: A 54-year-old male has a history of gout complicated by several prior episodes of acute gouty arthritis and 3 prior instances of nephrolithiasis secondary to uric acid stones. He has a serum uric acid level of 11 mg/dL (normal range 3-8 mg/dL), a 24 hr urine collection of 1300 mg uric acid (normal range 250-750 mg), and a serum creatinine of 0.8 mg/dL with a normal estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Which of the following drugs should be avoided in this patient? (A) Naproxen (D) Indomethacin (C) Allopurinol (B) Colchicine (E) Probenecid
Reason: Probenecid should be avoided in this patient because his uric acid levels are already elevated due to overproduction, as indicated by the high 24-hour urinary uric acid excretion. Probenecid increases uric acid excretion from the kidneys, which could lead to a higher risk of developing uric acid stones, making it an unsuitable choice for someone with a history of nephrolithiasis due to uric acid stones.
Answer: (E) Probenecid

Question: A 59-year-old male presents to the emergency room complaining of substernal chest pain. He reports a three-hour history of dull substernal chest pain that radiates into his left arm and jaw. He has experienced similar chest pain before that was brought on with exertion, but this pain is more severe and occurred with rest. His past medical history includes gout, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. An EKG demonstrates ST segment depression. Serum troponin is elevated. In addition to aspirin, oxygen, and morphine, he is started on a sublingual medication. What is the main physiologic effect of this medication? (C) Decrease afterload (E) Decrease heart rate (B) Increase preload (A) Decrease preload (D) Increase contractility
Reason: The sublingual medication described in the scenario is likely nitroglycerin, which is commonly used in acute coronary syndrome. Nitroglycerin primarily acts as a venodilator, which reduces the volume of blood returning to the heart (decreasing preload), thereby decreasing the amount of work the heart has to do and potentially alleviating angina symptoms.
Answer: (A) Decrease preload

Question: A 56-year-old African American presents to the emergency department due to abdominal pain, fatigue, and weight loss over the past 3 months. He has a long-standing history of chronic hepatitis B virus infection complicated by cirrhosis. On examination, he has jaundice, leg edema, and a palpable mass in the right upper abdominal quadrant. Abdominal ultrasound shows a 3-cm liver mass with poorly defined margins and coarse, irregular internal echoes. Lab results are shown:
Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 90 U/L
Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 50 U/L
Total bilirubin 2 mg/dL
Albumin 3 g/dL
Alkaline phosphatase 100 U/L
Alpha fetoprotein 600 micrograms/L
Which of the following is a feature of this patient's condition? (A) Liver biopsy is required for diagnosis in a majority of patients (B) It arises from the bile duct epithelium (C) It arises from hepatocytes (D) Daughter cysts are usually present on abdominal ultrasound (E) Doppler blood flow shows venous pattern
Reason: The patient's presentation, including his history of chronic hepatitis B and cirrhosis, along with the markedly elevated alpha-fetoprotein level and the characteristics of the liver mass suggest hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HCC originates from hepatocytes, which are the liver's parenchymal cells, distinguishing it from other types of liver tumors such as cholangiocarcinoma that arise from bile ducts.

Question: A 24-year-old woman presents to a medical office for a follow-up evaluation. The medical history is significant for type 1 diabetes, for which she takes insulin. She was recently hospitalized for diabetic ketoacidosis following a respiratory infection. Today she brings in a list of her most recent early morning fasting blood glucose readings for review. Her glucose readings range from 126 mg/dL–134 mg/dL, except for 2 readings of 350 mg/dL and 380 mg/dL, taken at the onset of her recent hospitalization. Given this data set, which measure(s) of central tendency would be most likely affected by these additional extreme values? (B) Median (C) Mode (A) Mean (D) Mean and median (E) Median and mode
Reason: The mean is particularly sensitive to extreme values, known as outliers, because it calculates the average by summing all values and dividing by the number of values. In this case, the extreme glucose readings of 350 mg/dL and 380 mg/dL would raise the mean significantly compared to the more moderately elevated readings of 126 mg/dL to 134 mg/dL, making the mean less reflective of the central tendency of the majority of the data. In contrast, the median and mode are less influenced by extreme values and would remain more stable.

Question: A 45-year-old woman undergoes endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) for evaluation of suspected biliary strictures. The ERCP identifies 2 ducts in the pancreas (a small ventral duct and a larger dorsal duct). A diagnosis of a congenital pancreatic anomaly is made. Which of the following statements best describes this anomaly? (D) Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) scanning of the abdomen is the most sensitive non-invasive diagnostic technique for this condition (A) Most of the patients with this condition present in early childhood with abdominal symptoms (E) Endoscopic ultrasonography reveals a 'stack sign' in patients with this condition (C) Patients with recurrent episodes of pancreatitis due to this condition do not require any intervention (B) It is a rare congenital anomaly of the pancreas
Reason: The answer indicates that MRCP is the most sensitive non-invasive diagnostic tool for this condition, likely due to its ability to provide detailed images of the pancreatic ductal system and biliary tree without the invasiveness of procedures like ERCP. MRCP has been established in medical literature as a superior technique for identifying congenital anomalies of the pancreas compared to other imaging methods, which supports the answer.
Answer: (D) Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) scanning of the abdomen is the most sensitive non-invasive diagnostic technique for this condition

Question: A 25-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by ambulance after a motor vehicle accident. His car was rear-ended by a drunk driver while he was stopped at a traffic light. At the scene, he was noted to have multiple small lacerations over his upper extremities from broken glass. He has otherwise been healthy, does not smoke, and drinks 5 beers per night. He notes that he recently started trying out a vegan diet and moved to an apartment located in a historic neighborhood that was built in the 1870s. Physical exam reveals several small lacerations on his arms bilaterally but is otherwise unremarkable. A complete blood workup is sent and some of the notable findings are shown below:

Hemoglobin: 12.1 g/dL (normal: 13.5-17.5 g/dL)
Platelet count: 261,000/mm^3 (normal: 150,000-400,000/mm^3)
Mean corpuscular volume: 74 µm^3 (normal: 80-100 µm^3)

Further testing using serum hemoglobin electrophoresis reveals:
Hemoglobin A1 92% (normal 95-98%)
Hemoglobin A2: 6% (normal: 1.5-3.1%)

Which of the following cell morphologies would most likely be seen on blood smear in this patient? (C) Megaloblasts (E) Schistocytes (B) Codocytes (A) All cells appear normal (D) Sideroblasts
Reason: The answer indicates that codocytes, or target cells, would likely be seen on the blood smear in this patient due to the presence of microcytic hypochromic anemia, which is commonly associated with conditions like beta-thalassemia. The elevated hemoglobin A2 level alongside the low mean corpuscular volume suggests a possible thalassemia trait, where codocytes are characteristic due to alterations in red blood cell membrane and hemoglobin content.

Question: A 48-year-old man, with a history of gluten intolerance, presents to the emergency department with persistent vomiting and diarrhea, and no fever. He recently returned from a vacation in Central America. He describes his diarrhea as profuse and almost clear. On physical examination, his skin turgor is decreased and his blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg. He is administered a saline solution and admitted for further examination and observation. What shifts are expected to be seen in this patient’s Darrow-Yannet diagram before the administration of saline? (E) Decreased extracellular volume and intracellular volume with a rise in osmolality (A) Decreased extracellular volume and osmolality with an increased intracellular volume (B) Increased extracellular volume, increased osmolarity, and decreased intracellular volume (D) Increased extracellular volume with no change in osmolarity or intracellular volume (C) Decreased extracellular volume with no change in osmolarity
Reason: The answer suggests that prior to saline administration, the patient exhibits a decreased extracellular volume without a change in osmolality. This is consistent with the clinical presentation of significant fluid loss due to diarrhea, leading to dehydration and decreased blood volume, while the body's osmolality remains relatively stable as the patient is likely still retaining electrolytes and other solutes.
Answer: (C) Decreased extracellular volume with no change in osmolarity

Path 1: Let's analyze the question step by step. The patient is classified as pre-diabetic based on her fasting and post-load glucose levels, and the physician is recommending lifestyle modifications to improve her insulin sensitivity.

Among the options provided:

- (A) Catecholamines: These typically act to raise blood glucose levels and can actually decrease insulin sensitivity during a stress response.
- (B) Glucagon: This hormone increases blood glucose levels and decreases insulin sensitivity.
- (C) Glucocorticoids: These increase glucose production and can promote insulin resistance, which is the opposite of what we want.
- (D) Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ): This is a nuclear receptor that, when activated, can promote insulin sensitivity, particularly by influencing fat cell function and glucose metabolism.
- (E) TNF-alpha: This inflammatory cytokine is associated with insulin resistance and can decrease insulin sensitivity.

Given the context of improving insulin sensitivity, the correct answer is:

**(D) Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ)**

This receptor is known for its role in enhancing insulin sensitivity, making it the most appropriate choice in this scenario.
Path 2: Let's analyze the question step by step. The patient is diagnosed as pre-diabetic with elevated fasting and two-hour glucose levels, indicating insulin resistance. To increase insulin sensitivity, we would look for signaling molecules or receptors known to enhance insulin action.

1. **Glucagon (B)**: This hormone typically increases blood glucose levels and opposes insulin action, making it unlikely to increase insulin sensitivity.

2. **Catecholamines (A)**: These hormones (like epinephrine) can promote hyperglycemia and are not associated with increasing insulin sensitivity.

3. **Glucocorticoids (C)**: These hormones generally increase blood glucose levels and can lead to insulin resistance, rather than improving sensitivity.

4. **Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (D)**: PPAR-gamma is a nuclear receptor that plays a significant role in the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism. Agonists of PPAR-gamma (such as thiazolidinediones) are known to improve insulin sensitivity.

5. **TNF-alpha (E)**: This cytokine is associated with inflammation and can contribute to insulin resistance.

Given this analysis, the correct answer is:

**Answer: (D) Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma**
Path 3: Let's analyze the options step by step. The goal is to identify which endogenous signaling molecules or receptors enhance insulin sensitivity:

- **(B) Glucagon**: This hormone is primarily involved in increasing blood glucose levels by promoting gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis. It does not increase insulin sensitivity; rather, it counteracts the effects of insulin.

- **(A) Catecholamines**: These hormones (like epinephrine and norepinephrine) can promote insulin resistance in certain contexts, especially during stress, as they mobilize glucose and fatty acids for energy.

- **(C) Glucocorticoids**: These hormones (like cortisol) can increase blood glucose levels and promote insulin resistance, so they do not increase insulin sensitivity.

- **(D) Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ)**: This is a nuclear receptor that plays a crucial role in the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism. Activating PPAR-γ increases insulin sensitivity, making it the correct answer.

- **(E) TNF-alpha**: This is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that is associated with insulin resistance rather than increased insulin sensitivity.

Given this analysis, the best answer is:

**Answer: (D) Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ)**.
Path 4: Let's analyze the options step by step:

- **(A) Catecholamines**: These generally decrease insulin sensitivity by promoting gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis in the liver.

- **(B) Glucagon**: This hormone primarily works to increase blood glucose levels by stimulating glucose production from the liver and does not increase insulin sensitivity.

- **(C) Glucocorticoids**: These hormones can lead to insulin resistance by promoting gluconeogenesis and reducing glucose uptake in tissues.

- **(D) Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ)**: This is a nuclear receptor that, when activated, increases insulin sensitivity. PPAR-γ agonists are used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes as they enhance insulin action primarily in adipose tissue.

- **(E) TNF-alpha**: This inflammatory cytokine is associated with increased insulin resistance.

Given this analysis, the correct answer that increases insulin sensitivity is:

**Answer: (D) Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ)**.
Path 5: To determine which endogenous signaling molecules or receptors increase insulin sensitivity in this patient, let’s analyze the options provided:

- **(B) Glucagon:** This hormone primarily increases blood glucose levels and does not increase insulin sensitivity; it actually works in opposition to insulin.

- **(A) Catecholamines:** These hormones (such as epinephrine) can increase blood glucose levels and decrease insulin sensitivity during stress responses.

- **(C) Glucocorticoids:** These hormones (such as cortisol) promote gluconeogenesis and can lead to insulin resistance, thus decreasing insulin sensitivity.

- **(D) Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ):** This receptor plays a significant role in adipocyte differentiation and glucose metabolism. Activation of PPAR-γ increases insulin sensitivity and is the target of thiazolidinediones, a class of diabetes medications that improve insulin sensitivity.

- **(E) TNF-alpha:** This cytokine is associated with inflammation and is known to promote insulin resistance rather than increase insulin sensitivity.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is:

**Answer: (D) Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ)**
Path 6: Let's think step by step through the options provided and their effects on insulin sensitivity.

- (B) **Glucagon**: This hormone typically increases blood glucose levels and has the opposite effect of insulin, so it does not increase insulin sensitivity.
  
- (A) **Catecholamines**: These hormones (like adrenaline) generally promote glycogen breakdown and increase blood glucose levels, again not enhancing insulin sensitivity.

- (C) **Glucocorticoids**: These hormones (like cortisol) can lead to insulin resistance, so they do not increase insulin sensitivity.

- (E) **TNF-alpha**: This is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that is associated with insulin resistance, so it does not promote insulin sensitivity.

- (D) **Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ)**: This receptor is involved in the regulation of glucose metabolism and lipid storage. Activation of PPAR-γ increases insulin sensitivity and is the target of certain antidiabetic medications (thiazolidinediones).

Given this information, the correct answer is:

**Answer: (D) Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ)**
Path 7: Let's analyze the options step by step:

1. **Glucagon (B)**: This hormone typically raises blood glucose levels by stimulating gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis in the liver. It does not increase insulin sensitivity.

2. **Catecholamines (A)**: While catecholamines can influence metabolism, they primarily act to increase blood glucose levels during stress by promoting glycogen breakdown and gluconeogenesis. They do not enhance insulin sensitivity.

3. **Glucocorticoids (C)**: These hormones generally promote insulin resistance by increasing gluconeogenesis and decreasing glucose uptake in peripheral tissues. They do not enhance insulin sensitivity.

4. **Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (D)**: PPAR-γ is a nuclear receptor that, when activated, plays a crucial role in fat cell differentiation and glucose metabolism. It is known to enhance insulin sensitivity, particularly in adipose tissue, and is a target for certain antidiabetic medications (e.g., thiazolidinediones).

5. **TNF-alpha (E)**: Tumor necrosis factor-alpha is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that is known to promote insulin resistance, not increase insulin sensitivity.

Given this analysis, the correct answer is:

**Answer: (D) Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma**.
Path 8: Let's think step by step. The patient in the scenario has been diagnosed with prediabetes and is at risk for developing type 2 diabetes. To improve insulin sensitivity, we want to consider which endogenous signaling molecules or receptors have a positive effect on insulin action.

1. **Glucagon** (B): This hormone generally increases blood glucose levels and does not enhance insulin sensitivity.
2. **Catecholamines** (A): These hormones (like epinephrine) can decrease insulin sensitivity by promoting gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis.
3. **Glucocorticoids** (C): These hormones can lead to insulin resistance and increase blood glucose levels.
4. **Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ)** (D): This receptor plays a key role in fat cell differentiation and glucose metabolism and is known to enhance insulin sensitivity. Agonists of PPAR-γ (like thiazolidinediones) are used to improve insulin sensitivity in patients with type 2 diabetes.
5. **TNF-alpha** (E): This cytokine is associated with inflammation and promotes insulin resistance.

Given this information, the correct answer is:

**Answer: (D) Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ)**
Path 9: Let's analyze the options step by step:

1. **Glucagon (B)**: This hormone promotes gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis in the liver, which increases blood glucose levels and does not enhance insulin sensitivity.

2. **Catecholamines (A)**: These hormones (such as epinephrine) generally promote gluconeogenesis and lipolysis, and they can decrease insulin sensitivity, especially during stress or fight-or-flight responses.

3. **Glucocorticoids (C)**: These hormones (such as cortisol) can lead to increased blood glucose levels and insulin resistance, thus they do not enhance insulin sensitivity.

4. **Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (D)**: This is a nuclear receptor that regulates fatty acid storage and glucose metabolism. Agonists of PPAR-gamma (like thiazolidinediones) improve insulin sensitivity and are often used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes.

5. **TNF-alpha (E)**: This cytokine is associated with inflammation and is known to promote insulin resistance rather than enhance insulin sensitivity.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is:

**Answer: (D) Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma**.
Path 10: Let's analyze the options step by step:

1. **Understanding the context**: The patient is pre-diabetic with insulin resistance, and we need to identify an endogenous signaling molecule or receptor that can increase insulin sensitivity.

2. **Evaluating the options**:
   - **(B) Glucagon**: This hormone primarily raises blood glucose levels by promoting gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis in the liver. It does not increase insulin sensitivity.
   - **(A) Catecholamines**: While they can affect metabolism, their primary role is to increase blood glucose levels during stress and they generally do not improve insulin sensitivity.
   - **(C) Glucocorticoids**: These hormones can induce insulin resistance, particularly in excess, and are not associated with increasing insulin sensitivity.
   - **(D) Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ)**: This receptor is involved in the regulation of fatty acid storage and glucose metabolism. Activation of PPAR-γ improves insulin sensitivity, particularly in adipose tissue.
   - **(E) TNF-alpha**: This cytokine is associated with inflammation and is known to contribute to insulin resistance, rather than improving it.

3. **Conclusion**: The option that is most likely to increase insulin sensitivity in this patient is **(D) Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma**.

Therefore, the answer is: **(D) Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma**.

Question: A 4-month-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his mother because of lethargy and vomiting since he woke up 1 hour ago. The mother says that he last breastfed the previous evening and slept through the night for the first time. His family recently immigrated from Bolivia. His temperature is 38.7°C (101.2°F). Physical examination shows dry mucous membranes and enlarged, reddened tonsils. Serum studies show:
Glucose 42 mg/dL
Ketones 0.2 mg/dL N = < 1 mg/dL
AST 40 U/L
ALT 60 U/L
Ammonia 80 μ/dL (N=15–45)
Which of the following enzymes is most likely deficient in this patient?" (C) Galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (A) Medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (E) Lysosomal acid α-1,4- glucosidase (D) Propionyl-CoA carboxylase (B) Alpha-L-iduronidase
Reason: To determine the likely enzyme deficiency in this case, we note that the patient presents with lethargy, vomiting, hypoglycemia (glucose of 42 mg/dL), and elevated ammonia levels. These findings suggest a metabolic disorder. The presence of hypoglycemia and the young age of the child point towards a defect in fatty acid oxidation, specifically medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, which is a common cause of metabolic decompensation in infants. The elevated ammonia level further supports the diagnosis of a metabolic disorder that affects energy production and waste elimination.
Answer: (A) Medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase

Question: A 21-year-old woman presents to the women’s clinic with chronic pelvic pain, especially during sexual intercourse. She also reports new onset yellowish vaginal discharge. She has no significant past medical history. She does not take contraceptive pills as she has had a copper intrauterine device placed. She smokes 2–3 cigarettes every day. She drinks beer on weekends. She admits to being sexually active with over 10 partners since the age of 14. Her blood pressure is 118/66 mm Hg, the heart rate is 68/min, the respiratory rate is 12/min and the temperature is 39.1°C (102.3°F). On physical examination she appears uncomfortable but alert and oriented. Her heart and lung examinations are within normal limits. Bimanual exam reveals a tender adnexa and uterus with cervical motion tenderness. Whiff test is negative and vaginal pH is greater than 4.5. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? (C) Bacterial vaginosis (B) Appendicitis (E) Pelvic inflammatory disease (A) Ectopic pregnancy (D) Urinary tract infection
Reason: The symptoms and examination findings in this case suggest pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). The patient presents with chronic pelvic pain, cervical motion tenderness, tender adnexa, and elevated temperature—classic signs of PID, often due to sexually transmitted infections. Additionally, the patient's history of multiple sexual partners increases her risk for infections that can lead to PID, making this diagnosis the most likely.
Answer: (E) Pelvic inflammatory disease

Question: A 10-year-old boy is brought to the pediatrician by his father because of recent changes in his behavior. His father states that he has noticed that the boy has begun to appear less coordinated than normal and has had frequent falls. On exam, the pediatrician observes pes cavus and hammer toes. The pediatrician makes a presumptive diagnosis based on these findings and recommends a formal echocardiogram. The pediatrician is most likely concerned about which of the following cardiovascular defects? (A) Tetrology of fallot (C) Endocardial cushion defect (E) Aortic cystic medial necrosis (D) Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (B) Coarctation of the aorta
Reason: The symptoms and physical exam findings in this 10-year-old boy, including decreased coordination, frequent falls, pes cavus, and hammer toes, suggest a possible diagnosis of Friedreich's ataxia, a hereditary condition that can be associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Given such a neurological and musculoskeletal presentation, the pediatrician is likely concerned about the potential cardiovascular defect of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which is known to occur in patients with this condition.
Answer: (D) Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy

Question: A 40-year-old woman brings her 2-day-old infant to the pediatrician’s office for a routine checkup. She tells the pediatrician that her baby vomits a greenish-yellow fluid after every feeding session. She has not been very successful in feeding him due to this problem. She also says that her baby has not passed stool since they left the hospital. On examination, the pediatrician observes that the baby has a flat facial profile and small eyes. The epicanthal folds are prominent and the palms have a single transverse crease. His abdomen is distended with high-pitched bowel sounds. The pediatrician orders an abdominal radiograph, the film is shown in the picture. Which of the following best explains the physical and clinical features exhibited by this infant? (D) Monosomy (B) Genomic imprinting (E) Locus heterogeneity (A) Trisomy (C) Anticipation
Reason: The clinical features described in this scenario, including the distinct facial anomalies (such as a flat facial profile and small eyes), prominent epicanthal folds, and additional physical characteristics like a single transverse crease on the palms, suggest a chromosomal abnormality that is often associated with trisomies. Particularly, these descriptions align with the classic presentation of Down syndrome, which is a result of Trisomy 21. The gastrointestinal symptoms and absence of stool passage are further indications of potential congenital issues that can accompany chromosomal abnormalities.
Answer: (A) Trisomy

Question: A 21-year-old woman presents for a routine check-up with a new primary care physician. She is concerned about a needle-stick that occurred 2 days ago while volunteering to clean a public park. She notes that she had about 8 drinks last night while celebrating her best friend's engagement. Otherwise she has been healthy and has no past medical history. She does not smoke and drinks socially. On physical exam, she is found to have scleral icterus and mild jaundice. Lab results are shown below:

Alanine aminotransferase (ALT): 9 U/L (normal range: 8-20 U/L)
Aspartate aminotransferase (AST): 11 U/L (normal range: 8-20 U/L)
Total bilirubin: 3.5 mg/dL (normal range: 0.1-1.0 mg/dL)
Direct bilirubin: 0.2 mg/dL (normal range: 0.0-0.3 mg/dL)
Hematocrit: 41% (normal range: 36%-46%)

Which of the following processes is most likely responsible for this patient's jaundice? (D) Excessive extravascular hemolysis (A) Alcohol-induced damage to liver parenchyma (E) Viral infection of hepatocytes (C) Defective secretion of bilirubin into the bile duct (B) Defective conjugation of bilirubin with glucuronic acid
Reason: The key indicators in this case are the patient's elevated total bilirubin levels combined with normal levels of liver enzymes (ALT and AST). This pattern suggests that the jaundice is predominantly due to a conjugation problem rather than hepatocellular damage or hemolysis, which would typically raise liver enzyme levels. In this case, a defect in the conjugation of bilirubin—involving the enzyme UDP-glucuronosyltransferase—would lead to an accumulation of unconjugated bilirubin, resulting in the observed jaundice.
Answer: (B) Defective conjugation of bilirubin with glucuronic acid

Question: A 35-year-old woman comes to the physician for evaluation of a 6-month history of persistent rhinorrhea and nasal congestion. She works in retail and notices her symptoms worsen anytime she is exposed to strong perfumes. Her symptoms have worsened since winter began 2 months ago. She has not had fever, nausea, wheezing, itching, or rash. She has no history of serious illness or allergies. She takes no medications. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows congested nasal mucosa, enlarged tonsils, and pharyngeal postnasal discharge. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? (A) Radioallergosorbent testing (C) Oral diphenhydramine (D) Intranasal azelastine (E) Percutaneous allergy testing (B) Oral phenylephrine
Reason: The patient's symptoms of persistent rhinorrhea and nasal congestion, which worsen with exposure to strong perfumes, indicate that she is likely suffering from allergic rhinitis. Intranasal azelastine is an effective antihistamine that can directly target nasal symptoms and is suitable for treating allergic rhinitis. This makes it a more appropriate and effective choice compared to other options like oral diphenhydramine or oral phenylephrine, which are not specifically focused on the nasal congestion and rhinitis caused by allergens.
Answer: (D) Intranasal azelastine

Question: An 83-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation, multiple ischemic strokes, and early dementia is found unresponsive in her apartment at her retirement community. She is believed to have not refilled any of her medications for a month, and it is determined that she passed away from a stroke nearly 2 weeks ago. The family is adamant that she receive an autopsy. Which of the following findings are most likely on brain histology? (D) Fat saponification (C) Cystic cavitation (E) Increased binding of acidophilic dyes (B) Cellular debris and neutrophils (A) Cellular debris and lymphocytes
Reason: Cystic cavitation is a characteristic finding in the brain after a stroke due to the loss of tissue and formation of fluid-filled spaces as a result of necrosis. Given that the patient had passed away from a stroke nearly two weeks prior, the time frame allows for such changes to occur, making cystic cavitation the most likely histological finding in this scenario.
Answer: (C) Cystic cavitation

Question: A 60-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with progressive nausea and vomiting. She reports that approximately one day prior to presentation she experienced abdominal discomfort that subsequently worsened to severe nausea, vomiting, and two episodes of watery diarrhea. She recently noticed that her vision has become blurry along with mild alterations in color perception. Medical history is significant for congestive heart failure with a low ejection fraction. She cannot recall which medications she is currently taking but believes she is taking them as prescribed. Which of the following is a characteristic of the likely offending drug that led to this patient’s clinical presentation? (B) Low potency (D) Ratio of toxic dose to effective dose close to 1 (E) Low bioavailability (A) High potency (C) Ratio of toxic dose to effective dose much greater than 1
Reason: The symptoms presented by the patient, such as nausea, vomiting, and visual disturbances, suggest a potential toxicity related to her medications, especially given her heart condition. A drug with a ratio of toxic dose to effective dose close to 1 indicates that the therapeutic range is narrow, making it more likely for side effects or toxicity to occur even at intended doses, which fits with this patient's acute symptoms.
Answer: (D) Ratio of toxic dose to effective dose close to 1

Question: A 16-year-old boy comes to the physician because of a painful lesion on the sole of his right foot for 1 month. It has become progressively larger and more painful, making it difficult for him to walk. He does not have any personal or family history of serious illness. Three years ago he was hospitalized for an ankle fracture that required open reduction and internal fixation. He has moderate facial acne for which he is not receiving any treatment right now. His immunizations are up-to-date. Examination shows a 1-cm lesion on the sole of his foot. The remainder of the examination is unremarkable. A photograph of his sole is shown below. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the lesion? (C) Human papilloma virus (D) Malignant transformation (B) Poxvirus (E) Benign growth (A) Trauma
Reason: The patient's presentation of a painful lesion on the sole of his foot that has enlarged over time strongly suggests a plantar wart, which is commonly caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Given that warts are typically benign proliferations resulting from HPV, and the description matches that of a viral etiology rather than trauma, malignancy, or poxvirus.

Question: A 10-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother because of a 2-day history of fever and productive cough. He has had similar episodes sporadically in the past with frequent episodes of thick, discolored nasal discharge. Physical examination shows diffuse crackles and rhonchi. An x-ray of the chest is shown. The most likely cause of recurrent infections in this patient is a dysfunction of which of the following cell types? (C) Type I pneumocytes (D) Club cells (B) Ciliated columnar cells (A) Alveolar macrophages (E) Type II pneumocytes
Reason: The answer is (B) Ciliated columnar cells because these cells are essential for the mucociliary escalator mechanism in the respiratory system, which helps clear mucus and pathogens. In this patient, recurrent respiratory infections and the described symptoms suggest that dysfunction of ciliated cells leads to impaired mucus clearance, resulting in chronic respiratory issues.
Answer: (B) Ciliated columnar cells

Question: An 8-year old boy with no past medical history presents to the emergency room with 24-hours of severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and non-bloody diarrhea. His mom states that he has barely eaten in the past 24 hours and has been clutching his abdomen, first near his belly button and now near his right hip. His temperature is 101.4°F (38.5°C), blood pressure is 101/63 mmHg, pulse is 100/min, and respirations are 22/min. On physical exam, the patient is lying very still. There is abdominal tenderness and rigidity upon palpation of the right lower quadrant. What is the most likely cause of this patient’s clinical presentation? (E) Twisting of the spermatic cord (B) Diverticulum in the terminal ileum (A) Granulomatous inflammation of the appendix (D) Structural abnormality of the appendix (C) Appendiceal lymphoid hyperplasia
Reason: The answer is (C) Appendiceal lymphoid hyperplasia because this condition often leads to inflammation and obstruction of the appendix, particularly in children, which can result in symptoms similar to appendicitis. The patient's clinical presentation of abdominal pain, tenderness in the right lower quadrant, fever, and rigidity is consistent with acute appendicitis, and lymphoid hyperplasia is a common underlying cause of such inflammation in pediatric patients.

Question: A 50-year-old man presents to a clinic with oliguria. Four weeks ago, he had a kidney transplant. Postoperative follow-up was normal. He is currently on cyclosporine and admits that sometimes he forgets to take his medication. On physical examination, the vital signs include: temperature 37.1°C (98.8°F), blood pressure 165/110 mm Hg, heart rate 80/min, and respiratory rate 16/min. There is mild tenderness on renal palpation. His serum creatinine level is 4 mg/dL, well above his baseline level after the transplant. Which of the following best describes the histological finding if a biopsy is taken from the transplanted kidney? (E) Lymphocytic infiltration of graft vessels and endothelial damage (C) Atherosclerosis on angiography (D) Thrombosis and occlusion of vessels (B) Necrosis with granulation tissue (A) Thickening of blood vessels, fibrosis of graft vessels, and parenchymal atrophy
Reason: The answer is (E) Lymphocytic infiltration of graft vessels and endothelial damage. This is indicative of acute rejection, which is characterized by the presence of lymphocytes infiltrating the renal interstitium and affecting the renal vasculature. The patient's high creatinine level and oliguria, along with a history of potential non-compliance with immunosuppressive therapy, suggest that acute rejection is a likely cause of his kidney dysfunction, supporting the histological findings associated with this condition.
Answer: (E) Lymphocytic infiltration of graft vessels and endothelial damage

Question: The incidence of a relatively benign autosomal recessive disease, X, is 1 in 25 in the population. Assuming that the conditions for Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium are met, what is the probability that a male and female, who are carriers, will have a child expressing the disease? (E) 8/25 (C) 4/5 (A) 1/4 (B) 1/5 (D) 1/25
Reason: The answer is (A) 1/4. In autosomal recessive inheritance, if both parents are carriers (heterozygous), there is a 25% chance (1 in 4) that their child will inherit the recessive allele from both parents and express the disease. This probability is derived using a simple Punnett square, which shows that from two carriers (represented as Aa x Aa), the possible genotypes of their offspring are 1 AA, 2 Aa, and 1 aa, with the aa genotype representing the disease.
Answer: (A) 1/4

Question: A graduate student at the biochemistry laboratory decides to research the different effects of vitamin deficiencies in mice by completely depriving the mice of one vitamin. The symptoms of this deficiency include posterior column and spinocerebellar tract demyelination, as well as hemolytic anemia. Further analysis is negative for megaloblastic anemia, hypersegmented neutrophils, and elevated serum methylmalonic acid. What characteristic of the vitamin is causing the symptoms in the mice? (D) The vitamin controls serum calcium levels (B) High doses can increase the effects of warfarin (E) The vitamin is important in rod and cone cells for vision (C) The vitamin facilitates iron absorption (A) Deficiency causes the impaired production of blood clotting factors in the liver
Reason: The answer is (B) High doses can increase the effects of warfarin. While the primary symptoms described, such as posterior column and spinocerebellar tract demyelination and hemolytic anemia, can be associated with deficiencies of certain vitamins, the mention of increased effects of warfarin points toward the role of vitamin K in blood clotting. Warfarin works by inhibiting vitamin K-dependent clotting factors; thus, high doses of vitamin K can counteract warfarin, making this characteristic relevant to the vitamin's metabolic functions.
Answer: (B) High doses can increase the effects of warfarin

Question: A 48-year-old patient with congestive heart failure is brought into the emergency room after an attempted suicide. He was found by his daughter whom he lives with while trying to suffocate himself. He had recently moved in with his daughter after his house went into foreclosure. The daughter lives in a small two-bedroom apartment that was recently baby proofed for her daughter. She cares for him and tries to help him with all of his medical appointments and taking his medications on time. He is noted to still consume moderate amounts of alcohol. She is concerned her father might try this again because his aunt died from suicide. Which of the circumstances is protective for this patient? (C) Compliance with his medication (A) Having a support system (D) Lack of illicit drug use (B) Lack of access to sharp objects (E) Lack of immediate family history of suicide
Reason: Having a support system is considered protective for this patient because emotional and practical support from family or friends can significantly reduce the risk of suicidal behavior. The presence of a caring daughter who is involved in his life and medical care may provide a vital protective factor by enhancing his sense of belonging and preventing feelings of isolation or despair.
Answer: (A) Having a support system

Question: A 64-year-old man presents to the emergency department with sudden onset of chest pain and an episode of vomiting. He also complains of ongoing nausea and heavy sweating (diaphoresis). He denies having experienced such symptoms before and is quite upset. Medical history is significant for hypertension and types 2 diabetes mellitus. He currently smokes and has smoked at least half a pack daily for the last 40 years. Vitals show a blood pressure of 80/50 mm Hg, pulse of 50/min, respirations of 20/min, temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), and oximetry is 99% before oxygen by facemask. Except for the patient being visibly distressed and diaphoretic, the examination is unremarkable. ECG findings are shown in the picture. Where is the most likely obstruction in this patient’s cardiac blood supply?
  (D) Left main coronary artery (E) There is no obstruction (B) Left anterior descending artery (A) Right coronary artery (C) Left circumflex artery
Reason: The most likely obstruction in this patient's cardiac blood supply is in the right coronary artery because of the patient's presentation, which is suggestive of an inferior wall myocardial infarction commonly associated with right coronary artery occlusion in individuals with a dominant right coronary system. Additionally, given the history of typical risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, and long-term smoking, this scenario aligns with the classic clinical picture of ischemia due to obstruction in this artery.
Answer: (A) Right coronary artery

His parents bring him back 1 month later with an erythematous and swollen umbilical cord still attached to the umbilicus. A complete blood cell count shows the following:
Hemoglobin  18.1 g/dL
Hematocrit 43.7%
Leukocyte count 13,000/mm3
Neutrophils 85%
Lymphocytes 10%
Monocytes 5%
Platelet count 170,000/mm3
The immunoglobulin levels are normal. The absence or deficiency of which of the following most likely led to this patient’s condition? (E) IL-1 (B) Histamine (D) TNF (A) CD18 (C) Prostaglandin E2
Reason: The absence or deficiency of CD18 most likely led to this patient’s condition because CD18 is a critical component of integrins that mediate leukocyte adhesion and migration. In infants, a deficiency in CD18 can result in leukocyte adhesion deficiency, which impairs the ability of neutrophils to migrate to sites of infection, leading to persistent infections such as the erythematous and swollen umbilical cord seen in this patient.
Answer: (A) CD18

Question: A 6-year-old boy is presented to a pediatric clinic by his mother with complaints of fever, malaise, and cough for the past 2 days. He frequently complains of a sore throat and has difficulty eating solid foods. The mother mentions that, initially, the boy’s fever was low-grade and intermittent but later became high grade and continuous. The boy was born at 39 weeks gestation via spontaneous vaginal delivery. He is up to date on all vaccines and is meeting all developmental milestones. The past medical history is noncontributory. The boy takes a multivitamin every day. The mother reports that he does well in school and is helpful around the house. The boy’s vital signs include blood pressure 110/65 mm Hg, heart rate 110/min, respiratory rate 32/min, and temperature 38.3°C (101.0°F). On physical examination, the boy appears uncomfortable and has difficulty breathing. His heart is mildly tachycardic with a regular rhythm and his lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Oropharyngeal examination shows that his palatine tonsils are covered with pus and that there is erythema of the surrounding mucosa. Which of the following mediators is responsible for this patient’s elevated temperature? (A) Leukotriene D4 (E) Prostaglandin F2 (B) Thromboxane A2 (C) Prostaglandin E2 (D) Prostaglandin I2
Reason: Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is a key mediator involved in the body's fever response, acting on the hypothalamus to increase the set point of body temperature. In cases of infection and inflammation, such as in this boy's condition with tonsillitis, PGE2 is produced in response to pyrogens, leading to the observed fever. Therefore, the elevated temperature in this patient can be attributed to the action of Prostaglandin E2.
Answer: (C) Prostaglandin E2

Question: A 62-year-old woman presents to the clinic for a 2-month history of ‘fogginess’. She reports that for the last couple of months she feels like she has "lost a step" in her ability to think clearly, often forgetting where she parked her car or to lock the front door after leaving the house. She also feels that her mood has been low. On further questioning, she reports mild constipation and that she has had a bothersome, progressively worsening cough over the past couple of months, accompanied by 6.8 kg (15 lb) unintentional weight loss. She has a history of hypertension for which she takes amlodipine daily. She has smoked 1.5 packs of cigarettes per day for the last 40 years. Physical exam is unremarkable. Laboratory studies show:
Na+ 138 mg/dL
K+ 3.9 mg/dL
Cl- 101 mg/dL
HCO3- 24 mg/dL
BUN 10 mg/dL
Cr 0.6 mg/dL
Glucose 86 mg/dL
Ca2+ 13.6 mg/dL
Mg2+ 1.9 mg/dL
Parathyroid hormone (PTH) 2 pg/mL (10–65)
1,25-hydroxyvitamin D 15 pg/mL (20–45)
Quantiferon-gold negative
Which of the following best describes this patient's most likely underlying pathology? (E) Toxicity (exogenous) (D) Neoplastic (A) Endocrine (C) Inflammatory (B) Infectious
Reason: The patient’s presentation suggests a paraneoplastic syndrome likely due to an underlying malignancy, indicated by her hypercalcemia (elevated calcium levels), unintentional weight loss, and symptoms consistent with a potential malignancy. The very low level of parathyroid hormone (PTH) alongside elevated calcium suggests that her hypercalcemia is not due to primary hyperparathyroidism but could be attributed to a neoplastic process, such as cancer, which often causes elevated calcium levels through parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP) production or osteolytic metastasis. Thus, the most likely underlying pathology in this case is neoplastic.
Answer: (D) Neoplastic

Question: A 19-year-old man with a history of generalized tonic-clonic seizures comes to the physician for a routine health maintenance examination. He is a known user of intravenous cocaine. His vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows multiple hyperpigmented lines along the forearms. Oral examination shows marked overgrowth of friable, ulcerated gingival mucosa. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's oral examination findings? (D) Cyclosporine (C) Lacosamide (B) Lamotrigine (A) Phenytoin (E) Carbamazepine
"
Reason: The gingival overgrowth observed in this patient is a known side effect of long-term phenytoin use, which is often prescribed for seizure management. Phenytoin induces fibroblast proliferation and collagen accumulation in the gums, leading to the marked overgrowth and friable, ulcerated gingival mucosa seen in this case.
Answer: (A) Phenytoin

Question: A 77-year-old woman presents to her physician because of fatigue and progressive dyspnea despite receiving optimal treatment for heart failure. Her medical history is positive for heart failure, active tuberculosis, and chronic renal failure, for which she has been in long-term hemodialysis (13 years). The woman currently takes rifampin and isoniazid. Her physical exam shows the presence of hepatomegaly (a jugular venous distention that fails to subside on inspiration) and an impalpable apical impulse. Her pulse is 122/min, respiratory rate 16/min, temperature 36.0°C (97.4°F), and blood pressure 120/60 mm Hg. Her cardiac monitor shows a prominent y descent in her jugular venous pulse. A cardiac ultrasound shows pericardial calcifications and small tubular-shaped ventricles. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient’s current condition? (B) Constrictive pericarditis (C) Dilated cardiomyopathy (A) Atrial fibrillation (E) Restrictive cardiomyopathy (D) Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
Reason: The most likely cause of the patient’s current condition is constrictive pericarditis, as indicated by her prominent y descent in jugular venous pulse, hepatomegaly, and the presence of pericardial calcifications seen on the cardiac ultrasound. These signs, coupled with her history of long-term hemodialysis and tuberculosis, suggest the thickening and fibrosis associated with constrictive pericarditis, which leads to altered cardiac filling and the observed symptoms of heart failure.
Answer: (B) Constrictive pericarditis

Question: A 13-year-old boy is brought to the emergency room 30 minutes after being hit in the face with a baseball at high velocity. Examination shows left periorbital swelling, posterior displacement of the left globe, and tenderness to palpation over the left infraorbital rim. There is limited left upward gaze and normal horizontal eye movement. Further evaluation is most likely to show which of the following as a result of this patient's trauma? (D) Cerebrospinal fluid leak (E) Disruption of medial canthal ligament (C) Pneumatization of frontal sinus (A) Injury to lacrimal duct system (B) Clouding of maxillary sinus
Reason: The most likely finding in this patient following the trauma is clouding of the maxillary sinus. The mechanism of injury, combined with the symptoms of periorbital swelling and tenderness over the infraorbital rim, suggests that there may be an orbital fracture, which can lead to obstruction of the maxillary sinus and resulting clouding due to fluid accumulation or hemorrhage.
Answer: (B) Clouding of maxillary sinus

Question: A 59-year-old patient with COPD is admitted with difficulty breathing and increased sputum production. Approx. a week ago, he developed an upper respiratory tract infection. On admission, his blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg, the heart rate 92/min, the respiratory rate 24/min, the temperature 37.6°C (99.7°F), and SaO2 on room air 87%. Chest radiograph shows consolidation in the lower lobe of the right lung. Arterial blood gases (ABG) are taken and antibiotics are started. A nasal cannula provides 2L of oxygen to the patient. When the ABG results arrive, the patient’s SaO2 is 93%. The results are as follows:
pH 7.32
PaO2 63 mm Hg
PaCO2  57 mm Hg
HCO3- 24 mEq/L
What is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient? (A) Increase oxygen to SaO2 > 95% (B) Re-take the ABG and observe the patient until the results are available (E) Administer oral corticosteroids (D) Intubate and start invasive ventilation (C) Start non-invasive positive pressure ventilation
Reason: The most appropriate next step in the management of this patient is to start non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV). This patient presents with acute respiratory acidosis and signs of respiratory distress due to COPD exacerbation, and NIPPV can help improve ventilation by reducing CO2 levels and relieving the work of breathing without the need for endotracheal intubation. Additionally, given the patient's low pH and elevated PaCO2, NIPPV can also aid in improving oxygenation and correcting the acid-base imbalance.
Answer: (C) Start non-invasive positive pressure ventilation

Question: A 24-year-old man is brought to the doctor’s office by his mother because the patient believes aliens have begun to read his mind and will soon have him performing missions for them. The patient’s mother says that the delusions have been intermittently present for periods of at least 1-month over the past year. When he is not having delusions, she says he still lacks expression and has no interest in socializing with his friends or going out. He has no past medical history and takes no prescription medications. The patient has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for the past 10 years. Since the disturbance, he has not been able to maintain employment and lives at home with his mother. His vitals include: blood pressure 124/82 mm Hg, pulse 68/min, respiratory rate 14/min, temperature 37.3°C (99.1°F). On physical examination, the patient exhibits poor eye contact with a flat affect. His speech is circumferential, land he is currently experiencing bizarre delusions. The results from a urine drug screen are shown below:
Amphetamine negative

Question: A 46-year-old male presents in consultation for weight loss surgery. He is 6’0” and weighs 300 pounds. He has tried multiple dietary and exercise regimens but has been unsuccessful in losing weight. The surgeon suggests a sleeve gastrectomy, a procedure that reduces the size of the stomach removing a large portion of the stomach along the middle part of the greater curvature. The surgeon anticipates having to ligate a portion of the arterial supply to this part of the stomach in order to complete the resection. Which of the following vessels gives rise to the vessel that will need to be ligated in order to complete the resection? (D) Right gastroepiploic artery (A) Left gastric artery (C) Splenic artery (E) Gastroduodenal artery (B) Right gastric artery
Reason: The correct answer is (C) Splenic artery because the splenic artery gives rise to the left gastroepiploic artery, which supplies blood to the greater curvature of the stomach. During a sleeve gastrectomy, a portion of the stomach where the left gastroepiploic artery supplies would need to be ligated to effectively resect that portion of the stomach.

Question: A 60-year-old male is admitted to the ICU for severe hypertension complicated by a headache. The patient has a past medical history of insulin-controlled diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. He smokes 2 packs of cigarettes per day. He states that he forgot to take his medications yesterday and started getting a headache about one hour ago. His vitals on admission are the following: blood pressure of 160/110 mmHg, pulse 95/min, temperature 98.6 deg F (37.2 deg C), and respirations 20/min. On exam, the patient has an audible abdominal bruit. After administration of antihypertensive medications, the patient has a blood pressure of 178/120 mmHg. The patient reports his headache has increased to a 10/10 pain level, that he has trouble seeing, and he can't move his extremities. After stabilizing the patient, what is the best next step to diagnose the patient's condition? (E) Doppler ultrasound of the carotids (A) CT head with intravenous contrast (B) CT head without intravenous contrast (C) MRI head with intravenous constrast (D) MRI head without intravenous constrast
Reason: The best next step to diagnose the patient's condition is a CT head without intravenous contrast because it is the most appropriate initial imaging modality to evaluate for potential intracranial hemorrhage or other acute pathologies in a patient presenting with a severe headache and neurological deficits. Given the patient's risk factors and the acute change in his neurologic status, a non-contrast CT is quick, widely available, and effective in ruling out serious complications such as subarachnoid hemorrhage or intracerebral hemorrhage.

Question: A 4430-g (9-lb 10-oz) male newborn is delivered at term to a 27-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1. The second stage of labor was prolonged and required vacuum-assisted vaginal delivery. Apgar scores are 9 and 10 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. Examination of the neonate 2 hours later shows a soft, nonpulsatile swelling over the left parietal bone that does not cross suture lines. Vital signs are within normal limits. The pupils are equal and reactive to light. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Heart sounds are normal. The spine is normal. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? (D) Epidermoid cyst (A) Lipoma (E) Encephalocele (B) Cephalohematoma (C) Subgaleal hemorrhage
Reason: The most likely diagnosis is a cephalohematoma because it presents as a soft, nonpulsatile swelling that does not cross suture lines, which is characteristic of this condition. Cephalohematoma typically occurs due to bleeding between the skull and the periosteum as a result of trauma during delivery, particularly in cases of prolonged labor or vacuum-assisted delivery, as seen in this newborn.

Question: A 70-year-old woman with history of coronary artery disease status-post coronary artery bypass graft presents with a stroke due to an infarction in the right middle cerebral artery territory. She is admitted to the intensive care unit for neurological monitoring following a successful thrombectomy. Overnight, the patient complains of difficulty breathing, chest pain, and jaw pain. Her temperature is 98.6°F (37°C), blood pressure is 160/80 mmHg, pulse is 100/min, respirations are 30/min, and oxygen saturation is 90% on 2L O2 via nasal cannula. Rales are heard in the lower lung bases. Electrocardiogram reveals left ventricular hypertrophy with repolarization but no acute ST or T wave changes. Troponin is 2.8 ng/mL. Chest radiograph reveals Kerley B lines. After administration of oxygen, aspirin, carvedilol, and furosemide, the patient improves. The next troponin is 3.9 ng/mL. Upon further discussion with the consulting cardiologist and neurologist, a heparin infusion is started. After transfer to a general medicine ward floor four days later, the patient complains of a headache. The patient's laboratory results are notable for the following:

Hemoglobin: 11 g/dL
Hematocrit: 36%
Leukocyte count: 11,000 /mm^3 with normal differential
Platelet count: 130,000 /mm^3

On admission, the patient's platelet count was 300,000/mm^3. What medication is appropriate at this time? (D) Protamine (E) Tinzaparin (C) Dalteparin (B) Enoxaparin (A) Argatroban
Reason: The appropriate medication at this time is Argatroban because the patient has developed thrombocytopenia, evidenced by a decrease in her platelet count from 300,000/mm^3 to 130,000/mm^3 after being on heparin. Argatroban is a direct thrombin inhibitor that can be used safely in patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), a condition where the use of heparin can cause a significant drop in platelet counts and increase the risk of thrombosis.
Answer: (A) Argatroban

[INFO] Opinion paths:
Path 1: Let's analyze the case step by step:

1. **Patient Profile**: The patient is a 21-year-old woman presenting with right arm pain, limited range of motion, diarrhea, nausea, and pain during intercourse. She has also had multiple visits to the ER over the past year for similar symptoms.

2. **Symptom Analysis**:
   - **Right Arm Pain**: This could be a musculoskeletal issue or referred pain from an abdominal problem.
   - **Diarrhea and Nausea**: These gastrointestinal symptoms might suggest an underlying GI condition.
   - **Pain during Intercourse**: This could imply a gynecological issue, possibly related to pelvic inflammatory disease or endometriosis.

3. **Previous ER Visits**: The fact that she has been to the ER multiple times with similar symptoms raises the suspicion of a psychological component, particularly if no clear medical diagnosis has been established.

4. **Negative Fecal Occult Test**: This suggests that there is no gastrointestinal bleeding, which helps rule out some serious gastrointestinal conditions.

5. **Diagnosis Consideration**:
   - **Ulcerative Colitis (A)**: Typically, this would present with more definitive gastrointestinal symptoms and might not explain the arm pain.
   - **Conversion Disorder (E)**: This involves neurological symptoms (like arm pain) that cannot be explained by medical conditions, often following psychological stress.
   - **Somatoform Pain Disorder (D)**: This involves chronic pain that cannot be fully explained by a medical condition, but it focuses on the pain aspect without necessarily including other physical symptoms.
   - **Somatization Disorder (C)**: This involves multiple physical complaints across different organ systems, often without a clear medical explanation. It is characterized by a long history of multiple unexplained medical symptoms.
   - **Illness Anxiety Disorder (B)**: This involves a preoccupation with having a serious illness, which does not seem to fit as well with her presentation.

Given her multiple ER visits for unexplained symptoms, the combination of physical complaints, and the lack of a definitive medical diagnosis, the most likely diagnosis is **Somatization Disorder (C)**. 

Therefore, the answer is: **(C) Somatization disorder**.
Path 2: Let's analyze the situation step by step. 

1. **Symptoms Overview**: The patient presents with right arm pain, limited range of motion, diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal tenderness. She also reports dyspareunia (pain during intercourse) and has a history of multiple ER visits for similar symptoms.

2. **Absence of Trauma**: The right arm pain is notable because she does not recall any trauma, which raises the possibility that the pain may not be due to a physical injury but potentially related to a psychological or psychosomatic condition.

3. **Negative Fecal Occult Test**: The negative fecal occult test suggests that there is no significant gastrointestinal bleeding, which might have indicated a condition like ulcerative colitis.

4. **Repeated ER Visits**: The history of multiple visits to the emergency room for similar symptoms may indicate a chronic condition that is not being effectively addressed, possibly pointing towards a psychological component.

5. **Symptom Presentation**: The combination of physical symptoms (arm pain, abdominal tenderness) along with the emotional distress (pain during intercourse, vague abdominal pain) and the negative workup for organic causes suggests a somatic symptom-related disorder.

Now, considering the options:

- **(A) Ulcerative colitis**: Unlikely due to the negative fecal occult test and lack of specific gastrointestinal symptoms.
- **(E) Conversion disorder**: This could be a possibility, as conversion disorder involves neurological symptoms (such as arm pain) with no clear medical cause, but the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms and the history of multiple ER visits leans away from this.
- **(D) Somatoform pain disorder**: This is characterized by pain that does not have a clear medical explanation and is often linked to psychological factors, making this a strong candidate.
- **(C) Somatization disorder**: This involves multiple physical complaints over time without a medical explanation but does not fit as well as somatoform pain disorder in this case.
- **(B) Illness anxiety disorder**: This is characterized by excessive worry about having a serious illness, which does not primarily focus on physical symptoms.

Given all this information, the most fitting diagnosis considering the chronic nature of her symptoms, the lack of clear medical explanation, and the psychological components would be:

**Answer: (D) Somatoform pain disorder**.
Path 3: Let's analyze the provided information step by step:

1. **Patient's Symptoms**: The patient presents with right arm pain, limited range of motion, diarrhea, nausea, and pain during intercourse. She has diffuse abdominal tenderness and has visited the ER multiple times with similar symptoms, suggesting a pattern of recurrent complaints.

2. **Negative Findings**: There is no erythema or edema in the arm, and the fecal occult test is negative, indicating that there may not be a clear organic cause for the symptoms.

3. **History of Presenting Complaints**: The fact that the patient has been to the ER multiple times for similar symptoms without a definitive diagnosis or identifiable organic cause suggests a psychological component to her symptoms.

4. **Diagnosis Options**:
   - (A) Ulcerative colitis: This typically would show specific gastrointestinal symptoms and abnormalities on examination or colonoscopy.
   - (B) Illness anxiety disorder: This involves excessive worry about having a serious illness, but the focus here seems more on physical symptoms rather than anxiety about illness.
   - (C) Somatization disorder: This involves multiple physical complaints that cannot be explained by a medical condition but is more specific to a pattern of multiple somatic complaints over time.
   - (D) Somatoform pain disorder: This focuses specifically on pain as a primary symptom without an identifiable physical cause.
   - (E) Conversion disorder: This involves neurological symptoms that cannot be explained by medical conditions, often associated with psychological stress.

Based on the recurrent nature of her symptoms, the absence of clear organic causes, and the combination of physical complaints, the most fitting diagnosis is likely **(C) Somatization disorder**, as it captures the broader pattern of multiple physical symptoms without an identifiable medical explanation.

Answer: (C) Somatization disorder.
Path 4: Let's analyze the information step by step:

1. **Patient Profile**: A 21-year-old woman with right arm pain, limited range of motion, diarrhea, nausea, and pain during intercourse. She has had multiple visits to the ER over the past year for similar symptoms.

2. **Symptoms and History**: The patient has vague abdominal tenderness in all four quadrants and negative fecal occult test, indicating no blood in the stool. Her symptoms are non-specific and have been recurrent without clear physical findings to explain them.

3. **Differential Diagnosis**:
   - **Ulcerative colitis (A)**: This typically presents with bloody diarrhea and abdominal pain, which doesn't fully align with her symptoms.
   - **Conversion disorder (E)**: This involves neurological symptoms that cannot be explained by a medical condition, often following psychological stress. However, her symptoms are more diffuse and do not fit this category well.
   - **Somatoform pain disorder (D)**: This involves the presence of pain without a clear medical cause, but it doesn't necessarily account for her other symptoms like diarrhea and nausea.
   - **Somatization disorder (C)**: This involves multiple physical complaints across several organ systems without a clear medical diagnosis, which seems to fit her case given her recurrent symptoms and lack of a definitive explanation.
   - **Illness anxiety disorder (B)**: This involves anxiety about having a serious illness, but she has actual physical complaints.

Given the chronicity of her symptoms, the variety of complaints, and the absence of physical findings supporting a specific medical diagnosis, the most likely diagnosis is:

**Answer: (C) Somatization disorder**.
Path 5: Let's think through the information provided step by step:

1. **Patient Profile**: A 21-year-old woman with right arm pain, limited range of motion, gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea and nausea), and pelvic pain (pain during intercourse). She has a history of multiple ER visits for similar symptoms.

2. **Physical Examination Findings**: Vague tenderness in all four abdominal quadrants without any specific findings like erythema or edema in the arm.

3. **History of Symptoms**: The patient has been to the ER multiple times in the past year for similar complaints, suggesting a recurring issue.

4. **Negative Fecal Occult Test**: This indicates that there is no blood in the stool, which makes certain gastrointestinal disorders (like ulcerative colitis) less likely, especially given the absence of specific symptoms such as rectal bleeding or tenesmus.

5. **Symptom Analysis**: The combination of arm pain, gastrointestinal complaints, and sexual pain, along with the history of multiple hospital visits without a clear physical cause, points towards a psychological component rather than a purely medical condition.

Based on the information, particularly the vague symptoms without a clear medical explanation and the history of multiple visits, the most fitting diagnosis would be:

**Answer: (E) Conversion disorder**

This is because the patient is presenting with physical symptoms (arm pain and gastrointestinal issues) that suggest a conversion disorder, where psychological distress manifests as physical symptoms without an identifiable medical cause.
Path 6: Let's analyze the situation step by step.

1. **Patient Presentation**: The patient is a 21-year-old woman presenting with right arm pain, limited range of motion, gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea and nausea), pain during intercourse, and diffuse abdominal tenderness. She has a history of frequent ER visits for similar symptoms, which suggests a pattern.

2. **Symptoms**: The combination of physical symptoms without a clear medical cause and the history of recurrent ER visits points away from a purely physiological condition. The lack of trauma and the vague nature of her symptoms suggest a psychological component may be at play.

3. **Potential Diagnoses**:
   - **Ulcerative colitis (A)**: Generally presents with more specific gastrointestinal symptoms, including bloody diarrhea and does not typically explain the arm pain.
   - **Conversion disorder (E)**: Characterized by neurological symptoms that cannot be explained by medical conditions, often following stress.
   - **Somatoform pain disorder (D)**: Involves the presence of pain that cannot be fully explained by a medical condition, but usually focuses on one particular area of pain.
   - **Somatization disorder (C)**: Involves multiple physical complaints across different organ systems, often with no clear medical explanation.
   - **Illness anxiety disorder (B)**: Involves excessive worry about having a serious illness despite medical reassurance, which does not seem to fit the current clinical picture as well as the others.

4. **Most Likely Diagnosis**: Given the symptoms and the frequent ER visits for various complaints, the most fitting diagnosis is **Somatization disorder (C)**, as it encompasses multiple physical symptoms across different areas without a clear medical cause.

Answer: (C) Somatization disorder
Path 7: Let's analyze the case step by step:

1. **Patient Symptoms**: The 21-year-old woman presents with right arm pain and limited range of motion without a history of trauma, diarrhea, nausea, and pain during intercourse. She also has vague tenderness in all four abdominal quadrants.

2. **History of ER Visits**: The patient has a record of multiple visits to the emergency room for similar, nonspecific symptoms over the past year.

3. **Negative Findings**: There is no erythema or edema on the right arm, and the fecal occult test is negative, suggesting that there may not be a clear organic cause for her symptoms.

4. **Possible Psychological Component**: The recurrent nature of her symptoms and the negative investigations suggest a psychological component may be present. 

5. **Differentiating Disorders**: 
   - **Conversion Disorder**: Involves neurological symptoms that are inconsistent with medical conditions, which may apply here if her arm pain is not based on a physical cause.
   - **Somatoform Pain Disorder**: Characterized primarily by pain without a clear medical explanation, which fits her situation.
   - **Somatization Disorder**: Involves multiple physical symptoms across various systems, which is less likely given the focus on pain.
   - **Illness Anxiety Disorder**: Involves excessive worry about having a serious illness, which doesn’t seem to fit her presentation as she has physical symptoms.
   - **Conversion Disorder**: Could be considered but is less focused on pain and more on neurologic symptoms.

Given the emphasis on pain in the absence of clear physical findings and the recurrent nature of her symptoms, the most fitting diagnosis for this patient is:

**Answer: (D) Somatoform pain disorder**
Path 8: Let's analyze the information provided step by step.

1. **Symptoms**: The patient presents with right arm pain, limited range of motion, diarrhea, nausea, pain during intercourse, and vague abdominal tenderness. Notably, there is no history of trauma to the arm, and she has been to the ER multiple times with similar symptoms.

2. **Duration and Pattern**: The fact that she has had similar episodes multiple times over the past year suggests a chronic condition or a functional disorder rather than an acute illness.

3. **Negative Findings**: The negative fecal occult blood test indicates that there is no evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding, which can help rule out certain organic conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease.

4. **Psychosomatic Considerations**: Given the recurring nature of her symptoms, the lack of a clear physical cause, and the presence of both physical and psychological components (like pain during intercourse), this may point towards a psychological origin of her physical symptoms.

5. **Diagnosis Options**:
   - **Ulcerative colitis (A)**: Unlikely due to negative fecal occult test and lack of more specific GI symptoms.
   - **Conversion disorder (E)**: This could fit, but it typically involves a more specific neurological symptom.
   - **Somatoform pain disorder (D)**: This could apply, as it involves pain without an identifiable physical cause.
   - **Somatization disorder (C)**: This involves multiple physical complaints and could be a possibility but is less specific to pain.
   - **Illness anxiety disorder (B)**: This involves excessive worry about having a serious illness but does not fit as well with her physical symptoms.

Given the recurrent nature of her symptoms, the absence of a physical cause, and the presence of psychological factors, the most fitting diagnosis is likely **Somatoform pain disorder (D)**. 

So, the answer is: **(D) Somatoform pain disorder**.
Path 9: Let's think through the details of the case step by step. 

The patient is a 21-year-old woman presenting with right arm pain and limited range of motion, without a clear history of trauma. She is also experiencing gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea and nausea) and has pain during intercourse. Notably, she has a pattern of recurrent visits to the emergency room with similar symptoms, which suggests a chronic issue.

The absence of erythema or edema in the arm, along with vague abdominal tenderness and negative fecal occult blood test, raises the suspicion of a non-organic cause for her symptoms. The patient's frequent visits to the ER and the nature of her complaints suggest that she may be experiencing psychological distress manifesting as physical symptoms, rather than a specific medical condition.

Given these considerations, the most likely diagnosis is (E) Conversion disorder. This condition involves neurological symptoms (like pain or limited range of motion) that cannot be fully explained by medical or neurological conditions and are often linked to psychological factors. 

Answer: (E) Conversion disorder.
Path 10: Let's think step by step. 

The key points in the case are:
1. The patient is a 21-year-old woman with right arm pain and limited range of motion.
2. She has gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea and nausea) and pain during intercourse.
3. She has vague abdominal tenderness but no clear signs of physical illness.
4. She has a history of multiple emergency room visits for similar symptoms without a clear diagnosis.

Given these points, the symptoms do not seem to be attributable to a clear medical condition, especially since no trauma is recalled and the physical examination does not reveal any significant findings. This pattern of recurrent, unexplained physical symptoms, along with the patient's history of multiple ER visits, suggests that the issue may be psychological rather than purely physical.

Among the options, "Conversion disorder" (which is now often categorized under "Functional Neurological Disorder") is characterized by neurological symptoms (such as pain, weakness, or sensory disturbances) that cannot be explained by a neurological or medical condition, often triggered by psychological stress.

Given the recurrent nature of her symptoms and the lack of a clear medical diagnosis, the most fitting diagnosis here would be:

Answer: (E) Conversion disorder

Question: A 33-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 14-hour history of left flank pain associated with dark urine. Her temperature is 37.2°C (99°F). The abdomen is soft with normal bowel sounds. There is guarding on the left lateral side and tenderness to palpation over the left costophrenic angle. An x-ray of the abdomen shows an 8-mm kidney stone. In addition to adequate hydration, which of the following diets should be advised for this patient? (D) Low-calcium diet (E) High-sodium diet (C) Low-protein diet (A) High-oxalate diet (B) Vitamin C supplementation
Reason: A low-protein diet is advisable in this case because high protein intake can increase the excretion of calcium and uric acid in the urine, potentially leading to the formation of more kidney stones. Additionally, certain protein sources can increase urinary oxalate levels, which is associated with oxalate stone formation, making a low-protein diet beneficial for managing kidney stones.
Answer: (C) Low-protein diet

Question: A 61-year-old man with a history of stage IIIa lung adenocarcinoma that has been treated with wedge resection and chemotherapy presents to the primary care clinic. He is largely asymptomatic, but he demonstrates a persistent microcytic anemia despite iron supplementation. Colonoscopy performed 3 years earlier was unremarkable. His past medical history is significant for diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, acute lymphoblastic leukemia as a child, and hypercholesterolemia. He currently smokes 1 pack of cigarettes per day, drinks a glass of pinot grigio per day, and currently denies any illicit drug use. His vital signs include: temperature, 36.7°C (98.0°F); blood pressure, 126/74 mm Hg; heart rate, 87/min; and respiratory rate, 17/min. On physical examination, his pulses are bounding, complexion is pale, but breath sounds remain clear. Oxygen saturation was initially 91% on room air, with a new oxygen requirement of 2 L by nasal cannula. Which of the following lab values would suggest anemia of chronic disease as the underlying etiology? (B) Decreased serum iron, increased transferrin, decreased ferritin, increased serum transferrin receptor (C) Increased serum iron and transferrin, increased ferritin, normal serum transferrin receptor (A) Decreased serum iron and transferrin, increased ferritin, normal serum transferrin receptor (D) Decreased serum iron and transferrin, decreased ferritin, normal serum transferrin receptor (E) Increased serum iron and transferrin, decreased ferritin, normal serum transferrin receptor
Reason: The laboratory values suggesting anemia of chronic disease (ACD) typically include decreased serum iron and transferrin, increased ferritin, and a normal serum transferrin receptor level. This pattern reflects the body's altered iron metabolism in response to chronic inflammation, where iron stores become sequestered and less available for erythropoiesis, resulting in the characteristic findings of ACD.
Answer: (A) Decreased serum iron and transferrin, increased ferritin, normal serum transferrin receptor

Question: A 55-year-old woman presents to her family physician with a 1-week history of dizziness. She experiences spinning sensations whenever she lies down and these sensations increase when she turns her head to the right. These episodes are transient, intermittent, last for less than a minute, occur multiple times in a day, and are associated with nausea. Between the episodes, she is fine and is able to perform her routine activities. She denies fever, hearing disturbances, diplopia, tinnitus, and recent flu or viral illness. Past medical history is significant for diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia. She does not use tobacco or alcohol. Her blood pressure is 124/78 mm Hg, the heart rate is 79/min, and the respiratory rate is 13/min. During the examination, when she is asked to lie supine from a sitting position with her head rotated towards the right side at 45°, horizontal nystagmus is observed. What is the next best step in the management of this patient? (B) Dix-Hallpike maneuver (E) Reassurance and vestibular suppressants (D) MRI of the brain with gadolinium (C) High dose steroids (A) Broad-spectrum antibiotics
Reason: The symptoms described, including transient episodes of dizziness with spinning sensations (vertigo) that are provoked by specific head movements, suggest benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). Given that the patient is otherwise stable and does not exhibit concerning symptoms such as hearing loss or neurological deficits, reassurance and vestibular suppressants are appropriate to manage her symptoms while the condition resolves naturally.
Answer: (E) Reassurance and vestibular suppressants

Question: A 66-year-old man presents to the outpatient department complaining of a rash similar to the ones in the image. The skin lesions have been present for about 2 weeks. It is present in the buttocks and both inferior limbs. There is no association of skin lesions with exposure to sunlight or medication use. The patient also reports joint pain affecting the distal and proximal joints in both the upper and lower limbs. The joint pain has been present for about a week and seems to improve with Tylenol use. The patient is a retired armed force personnel with an extensive tour of overseas duty. He received blood transfusion following a career-ending injury about 30 years ago. He denies alcohol and tobacco use. He is currently in a monogamous relationship with his wife for 40 years. His past medical history is significant for hypertension controlled on Enalapril. Physical examination shows mild pallor, multiple palpable purpuric lesions with occasional ulcerations bilaterally in the upper and lower limbs. Pulse rate is 88/min and blood pressure is 128/82 mm Hg. Laboratory test findings are:
HIV I and II antibodies negative
Rheumatoid factor positive
Hepatitis C antigen positive
Hepatitis B surface antigen positive
Hepatitis B antibody positive
Anti-neutrophil antibody positive
Hematocrit 38%
Which of the following mechanisms is most likely responsible for his clinical presentation? (A) Cyto-proliferative effect of HCV on hepatocytes (E) Virus-induced clonal expansion of autoreactive B lymphocytes (B) Excessive uroporphyrinogen caused by HCV induced decarboxylase deficiency (C) Defective hepatic removal of IgA caused by chronic HCV (D) Monoclonal expansion of IgM caused by benign neoplasia
Reason: The patient's clinical presentation suggests an underlying autoimmune process, as indicated by the presence of joint pain and a positive rheumatoid factor, alongside the hepatitis C infection. Hepatitis C is known to be associated with the development of mixed cryoglobulinemia and can lead to an expansion of autoreactive B lymphocytes, which would account for the systemic symptoms and skin manifestations observed in this case.
Answer: (E) Virus-induced clonal expansion of autoreactive B lymphocytes

Question: A 34-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician for a routine check-up. She complains that she is not feeling her normal self, but has no specific complaints. After a routine examination, the physician orders a full thyroid workup, including TSH, T3, and free T4. He also refers her directly to an oncologist for an initial consultation. Which type of lymphadenopathy was most likely present during the physical examination that made the primary care physician react this way? (C) Reactive lymphadenitis (B) Generalized painless lymphadenopathy (D) Localized painful lymphadenopathy (A) Generalized painful lymphadenopathy (E) Localized painless lymphadenopathy
Reason: The primary care physician's decision to refer the patient to an oncologist suggests a concern for a possible malignancy, which often presents with painless lymphadenopathy. Localized painless lymphadenopathy is particularly concerning for conditions such as lymphoma or other cancers, especially if observed during the physical examination, prompting immediate referral for further evaluation.
Answer: (E) Localized painless lymphadenopathy

Question: A 26-year-old man comes to the physician for evaluation of fatigue, facial rash, hair loss, and tingling of his hands and feet. He has followed a vegetarian diet for the past 3 years and has eaten 8 raw egg whites daily for the past year in preparation for a bodybuilding competition. Physical examination shows conjunctival injections and a scaly, erythematous rash around the eyes and mouth. Laboratory studies show decreased activity of propionyl-coenzyme A carboxylase in peripheral blood lymphocytes. Which of the following substances is most likely to be decreased in this patient? (D) Lactate (C) Adenine (A) Cystathionine (E) Oxaloacetate (B) Ribulose-5-phosphate
Reason: The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings suggest a deficiency in biotin, which is a cofactor for the enzyme propionyl-coenzyme A carboxylase. A deficiency in biotin would impair the conversion of propionyl-CoA to methylmalonyl-CoA, leading to decreased levels of oxaloacetate, as it is involved in the metabolic pathway that uses this enzyme, ultimately disrupting gluconeogenesis and the citric acid cycle.
Answer: (E) Oxaloacetate

Question: A 22-year-old woman with a history of bipolar disorder presents to her psychiatrist’s office for a follow-up appointment. She says she is doing better on the new drug she was prescribed. However, she recently noticed that she is drinking a lot of water and urinates more frequently throughout the day. She also says there are moments recently when she feels confused and agitated. Her vitals include: blood pressure 122/89 mm Hg, temperature 36.7°C (98.0°F), pulse 88/min and respirations 18/min. Her physical examination is within normal limits. Which of the following drugs was she most likely prescribed? (B) Amitriptyline (E) Chlorpromazine (C) Valproic acid (D) Carbamazepine (A) Lithium
Reason: The answer is likely (A) Lithium because one of the well-known side effects of lithium, a common medication for bipolar disorder, is polydipsia (increased thirst) and polyuria (increased urination). Additionally, confusion and agitation can also be indicative of lithium toxicity, especially if the lithium levels become elevated due to dehydration or other factors.
Answer: (A) Lithium

Question: A 43-year-old man comes to the emergency room complaining of chest discomfort. He describes the feeling as "tightness," and also reports weakness and palpitations for the past hour. He denies shortness of breath, diaphoresis, or lightheadedness. He has no significant past medical history, and does not smoke, drink, or use illicit drugs. His father had a myocardial infarction at age 72. He is afebrile, heart rate is 125 bpm, and his blood pressure is 120/76. He is alert and oriented to person, place, and time. His electrocardiogram is shown below. Which of the following tests should be ordered in the initial work-up of this patient's condition? (D) Thyroid stimulating hormone level (TSH) (B) Blood alcohol level (C) Chest x-ray (E) Urine metanephrines (A) Urine free cortisol level
Reason: The answer is likely (D) Thyroid stimulating hormone level (TSH) because the patient's symptoms of chest discomfort, palpitations, and increased heart rate could be indicative of hyperthyroidism, among other conditions. Since thyroid disorders can manifest with symptoms such as these, checking levels of TSH is a prudent initial step to rule out thyroid-related issues that could be contributing to his symptoms.
Answer: (D) Thyroid stimulating hormone level (TSH)

Question: A 20-month-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his parents with fever and diarrhea that have persisted for the past 2 days. He has a history of repeated bouts of diarrhea, upper respiratory tract infections, and failure to thrive. His vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 80/40 mm Hg, pulse 130/min, temperature 39.0°C (102.2°F), and respiratory rate 30/min. Blood tests are suggestive of lymphopenia. The child is diagnosed with severe combined immune deficiency after additional testing. Which of the following is the most common association with this type of immunodeficiency? (A) X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (B) Adenosine deaminase deficiency (E) Bare lymphocyte syndrome (C) Janus-associated kinase 3 (JAK3) deficiency (D) Reticular dysgenesis
Reason: The answer is likely (A) X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) because this form of SCID is the most common type and is typically associated with a mutation in the IL2RG gene, leading to a significant compromise in immune function. The clinical presentation of repeated infections, failure to thrive, and lymphopenia is consistent with X-linked SCID, particularly in young boys, making it a leading consideration in this case.
Answer: (A) X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency

Question: A previously healthy 9-year-old, Caucasian girl presents to your office with severe abdominal pain. Her mother also mentions that she has been urinating significantly less lately. History from the mother reveals that the girl suffers from acne vulgaris, mild scoliosis, and had a bout of diarrhea 3 days ago after a family barbecue. Lab work is done and is notable for a platelet count of 97,000 with a normal PT and PTT. The young girl appears dehydrated, yet her serum electrolyte levels are normal. What is the most likely etiology of this girl's urinary symptoms? (A) Hypothalamic dysfucntion (C) Toxic shock syndrome (B) Surreptitious laxative use (D) Shiga toxin production from Shigella (E) Shiga-like toxin production from EHEC
Reason: The most likely etiology of this girl's urinary symptoms is (E) Shiga-like toxin production from EHEC. This conclusion is supported by her recent history of diarrhea following a family barbecue, which could indicate exposure to E. coli contamination, and her symptoms of abdominal pain and decreased urination, consistent with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) that can occur with EHEC infection.
Answer: (E) Shiga-like toxin production from EHEC

Question: Two days after being admitted for pneumonia, a 70-year-old man has repeated episodes of palpitations and nausea. He does not feel lightheaded and does not have chest pain. The patient appears mildly distressed. His pulse is 59/min and blood pressure is 110/60 mm Hg. Examination shows no abnormalities. Sputum cultures taken at the time of admission were positive for Mycoplasma pneumoniae. His magnesium is 2.0 mEq/L and his potassium is 3.7 mEq/L. An ECG taken during an episode of palpitations is shown. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? (E) Adminstration of potassium chloride (D) Intermittent transvenous overdrive pacing (B) Administration of magnesium sulfate (C) Administration of amiodarone (A) Administration of metoprolol
Reason: The most appropriate next step in management for this patient is (B) Administration of magnesium sulfate. This decision is supported by the patient's bradycardia (pulse of 59/min) and his mild distress, which may indicate a complication due to magnesium deficiency, particularly since his magnesium level is at the lower limit of normal. Administering magnesium sulfate can help address potential arrhythmias related to low magnesium levels and improve his overall cardiovascular stability.
Answer: (B) Administration of magnesium sulfate

Question: A 4-year-old-female presents with a flattened, reddish 2 cm lump located at the base of the tongue. The patient's mother reports her having trouble swallowing, often leading to feeding difficulties. The mother also reports lethargy, constipation, dry skin, and hypothermia. Which of the following is the most appropriate management of this patient’s presentation? (A) Combination therapy of methimazole and Beta-blockers (D) Surgical excision of mass followed by levothyroxine administration (C) Radioactive iodine ablation (E) No treatment is necessary, counsel mother on alternative feeding techniques (B) Week-long course of penicillin
Reason: The most appropriate management for this patient is (D) Surgical excision of mass followed by levothyroxine administration. This choice is supported by the presence of a lump at the base of the tongue, which is likely causing the swallowing difficulties, along with her symptoms of lethargy, constipation, dry skin, and hypothermia that suggest hypothyroidism, possibly due to a thyroid mass. Surgical excision of the mass will relieve the swallowing obstruction and allow for appropriate management of her thyroid function with levothyroxine if needed.
Answer: (D) Surgical excision of mass followed by levothyroxine administration

Question: Several years after a teenage boy and his younger brother witnessed a gang related murder, they both decided to come forward and report it to authorities. The older brother describes the horrific decapitation of the gang member without displaying any emotion; but when the younger brother was asked about the crime, he had no recollection of the event. Which two ego defenses are being displayed by these brothers, respectively? (D) Splitting; Regression (E) Suppression; Repression (B) Isolation of affect; Displacement (A) Isolation of affect; Repression (C) Denial; Dissociation
Reason: The answer is (A) Isolation of affect; Repression because the older brother is displaying isolation of affect by recounting a traumatic event without emotional response, indicating he has separated his feelings from the memory. Conversely, the younger brother's complete lack of recollection of the event suggests repression, as he is unconsciously blocking out the memory of the trauma to protect himself from distress.
Answer: (A) Isolation of affect; Repression

Question: A 22-year-old man presents to a physician with a single painless ulcer on his glans penis that he first noticed 2 weeks ago. He mentions that he is sexually active with multiple partners. There is no history of fevers. Initially, he thought that the ulcer would go away on its own, but decided to come to the clinic because the ulcer persisted. On palpation of the ulcer, the edge and base are indurated. There is no purulence. Multiple painless, firm, and non-fixed lymph nodes are present in the inguinal regions bilaterally. The physician orders a Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) test, which is positive. The Treponema pallidum particle agglutination assay is also positive. Upon discussing the diagnosis, the patient informs the physician that he has a severe allergy to penicillin and he declines treatment with an injectable medicine. Which of the following drugs is most appropriate for this patient? (D) Metronidazole (B) Chloramphenicol (E) Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (C) Ciprofloxacin (A) Azithromycin
Reason: The answer is (A) Azithromycin, as this macrolide antibiotic is effective in treating syphilis, particularly in patients with penicillin allergies. In cases of penicillin allergy, Azithromycin can be used as an alternative treatment, although it is important to note that clinical guidelines may vary, and sensitivity to individual medications should also be considered.

Question: A 38-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 2, is brought to the emergency department by her husband after an episode of unconsciousness. She delivered a healthy infant two weeks ago and the postpartum course was complicated by severe vaginal bleeding, for which she required 4 units of packed red blood cells. Since the blood transfusion, she has had decreased milk production and has felt fatigued. Her pulse is 118/min and blood pressure is 104/63 mm Hg. Her finger-stick glucose concentration is 34 mg/dL. Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone and thyroxine levels are low and the serum sodium level is 132 mEq/L. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's condition? (B) Lactotrophic adenoma (C) Adrenal hemorrhage (E) Pituitary ischemia (A) Postpartum thyroiditis (D) Hypothalamic infarction
Reason: The patient's clinical presentation following her recent childbirth, including acute adrenal insufficiency indicated by fatigue, hypotension, and hypoglycemia, along with low thyroid hormones and low serum sodium, suggests a dysfunction of the pituitary gland, likely due to pituitary ischemia, also known as Sheehan's syndrome. This condition occurs when the pituitary gland does not receive enough blood due to severe blood loss during or after delivery, leading to the hormonal deficiencies observed in this patient.
Answer: (E) Pituitary ischemia

Question: An investigator is studying brachial artery reactivity in women with suspected coronary heart disease. The brachial artery diameter is measured via ultrasound before and after intra-arterial injection of acetylcholine. An increase of 7% in the vascular diameter is noted. The release of which of the following is most likely responsible for the observed effect? (E) Atrial natriuretic peptide from atrial myocytes (D) Norepinephrine from the adrenal medulla (A) Nitric oxide from endothelial cells (B) Endothelin from the peripheral vasculature (C) Serotonin from neuroendocrine cells
Reason: The observed increase in brachial artery diameter after intra-arterial injection of acetylcholine is most likely due to the release of nitric oxide from endothelial cells. Acetylcholine stimulates endothelial cells to produce nitric oxide, a potent vasodilator, which relaxes vascular smooth muscle and causes the observed increase in arterial diameter, demonstrating endothelium-dependent vasodilation.
Answer: (A) Nitric oxide from endothelial cells

Question: A 17-year-old girl comes to the physician because of a 2-day history of pain in her right knee. Last week she had right wrist pain. She has no history of recent trauma. She returned from summer camp in Connecticut 2 weeks ago. She is sexually active with one male partner and uses an oral contraceptive. Her temperature is 38°C (100.4°F). Examination shows several painless vesiculopustular lesions on the back and one lesion on the right sole of the foot. There is swelling of the right knee with tenderness to palpation. Passive extension of the right wrist and fingers elicits pain. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? (D) Disseminated gonococcal infection (C) Systemic lupus erythematosus (B) Staphylococcus aureus arthritis (E) Acute rheumatic fever (A) Reactive arthritis
Reason: The clinical presentation of the patient, including the joint pain in the right knee and wrist, the presence of vesiculopustular skin lesions, and her recent travel history to Connecticut, points towards a disseminated gonococcal infection as a likely diagnosis. The combination of fever, polyarthralgia, and characteristic skin lesions often associated with gonorrhea infection supports this conclusion, particularly given her sexual history.
Answer: (D) Disseminated gonococcal infection

Question: A 28-year-old woman comes to a fertility clinic because she has been trying to conceive for over a year without success. She has never been pregnant, but her husband has 2 children from a previous marriage. She broke a collarbone during a skiing accident but has otherwise been healthy with no chronic conditions. On physical exam, she is found to have minimal pubic hair and suprapubic masses. Speculum examination reveals a small vagina with no cervical canal visible. The most likely cause of this patient's infertility has which of the following modes of inheritance? (D) Multiple genetic loci (A) Autosomal recessive (E) X-linked recessive (B) Extra chromosome (C) Missing chromosome
Reason: The patient's symptoms, which include minimal pubic hair, suprapubic masses, and a small vagina with no visible cervical canal, are suggestive of Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome, a condition often linked to a genetic basis. Since MRKH syndrome can be associated with mutations on the X chromosome, this supports the conclusion that the mode of inheritance is likely X-linked recessive.
Answer: (E) X-linked recessive

Question: A 55-year-old female presents to the emergency room complaining of severe abdominal pain. She reports a six-month history of worsening dull mid-epigastric pain that she had attributed to stress at work. She has lost fifteen pounds over that time. She also reports that her stools have become bulky, foul-smelling, and greasy. Over the past few days, her abdominal pain acutely worsened and seemed to radiate to her back. She also developed mild pruritus and yellowing of her skin. Her temperature is 101°F (38.3°C), blood pressure is 145/85 mmHg, pulse is 110/min, and respirations are 20/min. On examination, her skin appears yellowed and she is tender to palpation in her mid-epigastrium and right upper quadrant. She is subsequently sent for imaging. If a mass is identified, what would be the most likely location of the mass? (B) Cystic duct (E) Ampulla of Vater (A) Common hepatic duct (C) Common bile duct (D) Pancreatic duct
Reason: The patient's symptoms, including severe abdominal pain, weight loss, steatorrhea, and jaundice, suggest the possibility of a condition affecting the pancreas or biliary system, possibly due to a mass obstructing the bile flow. The Ampulla of Vater is the site where the pancreatic duct and common bile duct merge and enter the duodenum; a mass here could cause both biliary obstruction leading to jaundice and symptoms related to pancreatic dysfunction, explaining her clinical presentation.

Path 1: Let's think step by step. The scenario describes a 12-year-old boy with persistent unilateral nasal bleeding (epistaxis) from the left nostril, which is likely due to a common cause such as a ruptured blood vessel in the anterior nasal cavity.

The most appropriate initial therapy for managing epistaxis in children typically involves conservative measures to stop the bleeding. This includes:

1. **Manual compression**: Squeezing the nostrils together can help apply pressure to the bleeding site.
2. **Positioning**: Keeping the head elevated can help reduce blood flow to the area and prevent swallowing blood.

Given these considerations, the most appropriate initial therapy for this patient would be:

**(E) Squeezing the nostrils manually for 10 minutes with the head elevated.**

This approach is a first-line treatment for epistaxis and can often effectively control the bleeding before considering more invasive measures.
Path 2: Let's think step by step. The clinical scenario describes a 12-year-old boy experiencing persistent unilateral nasal bleeding (epistaxis) from the left nostril without any significant prior history. The initial approach to manage epistaxis involves conservative measures.

1. **Manual compression**: The most appropriate initial therapy for acute anterior epistaxis is to apply direct pressure. This is typically done by pinching the nostrils together for about 10 minutes while keeping the head elevated. This method can help in stopping the bleeding by promoting clotting.

2. **Other options**: 
   - **Epinephrine gauze** placement and **anterior packing** are more advanced measures typically used if initial conservative management fails.
   - **Silver nitrate cauterization** is not appropriate initially in cases of acute bleeding.
   - **Oxymetazoline nasal spray** can help vasoconstrict, but it's usually used as an adjunctive measure rather than the initial step.

Considering the above points, the most appropriate initial therapy in this case is:

Answer: (E) Squeezing the nostrils manually for 10 minutes with the head elevated.
Path 3: Let's analyze the situation step by step.

The boy is experiencing a spontaneous nosebleed (epistaxis) from his left nostril with no prior history of similar episodes. He is currently applying pressure to the bleeding site, which is a good initial response. Given that it is a unilateral nosebleed, the most appropriate initial therapy for an anterior nosebleed is to manage it conservatively.

The options provided include various interventions for managing epistaxis:

- (C) Placement of an epinephrine gauze in the left nostril: This is more invasive and typically used for severe or persistent cases.
- (A) Anterior packing and topical antibiotics: This is used for more severe or recurrent nosebleeds but is not the first-line initial therapy.
- (E) Squeezing the nostrils manually for 10 minutes with the head elevated: This is a common and effective first-line treatment for anterior nosebleeds and is usually recommended.
- (D) Silver nitrate cauterization of the bleeding vessel and surrounding vessels: This is more of a definitive treatment and not the first step.
- (B) Oxymetazoline nasal spray: This can help constrict blood vessels and is also an option but may not be as effective as direct manual pressure.

Given that the standard initial management for an anterior nosebleed is to apply direct pressure by squeezing the nostrils and keeping the head elevated, the most appropriate initial therapy in this case is:

**Answer: (E) Squeezing the nostrils manually for 10 minutes with the head elevated.**
Path 4: Let's think through the scenario step by step.

The 12-year-old boy is experiencing persistent unilateral nasal bleeding (epistaxis) from his left nostril. He has no significant medical or family history related to bleeding, and his vital signs are normal. The bleeding is spontaneous and has not been previously encountered.

In managing epistaxis, especially in an acute setting, initial treatment typically focuses on direct pressure and ensuring the head is positioned correctly to reduce blood flow to the nasal vessels. 

**Option Analysis:**
- **(C) Placement of an epinephrine gauze in the left nostril:** This option is more invasive and generally used when other methods fail or for more severe cases.
- **(A) Anterior packing and topical antibiotics:** This is a good option for persistent epistaxis but may not be the first step in management.
- **(E) Squeezing the nostrils manually for 10 minutes with the head elevated:** This is a common first-line approach for managing epistaxis. It allows the pressure to help stop the bleeding and is a conservative treatment.
- **(D) Silver nitrate cauterization of the bleeding vessel and surrounding vessels:** This is used for recurrent epistaxis or if there is a visible vessel but not the initial step in acute bleeding.
- **(B) Oxymetazoline nasal spray:** This can help with vasoconstriction but is not the first-line intervention.

Considering the situation, the most appropriate initial therapy for this boy's acute nasal bleeding is **(E) Squeezing the nostrils manually for 10 minutes with the head elevated**. This method is effective and is the recommended first step in managing simple cases of epistaxis.

**Answer: (E) Squeezing the nostrils manually for 10 minutes with the head elevated.**
Path 5: Let's think step by step. 

The scenario describes a 12-year-old boy with a spontaneous nosebleed (epistaxis) from his left nostril. He is currently applying pressure to the area, which is a common first response to control bleeding. 

When considering the options for initial therapy for anterior nosebleeds, it's important to focus on methods that are effective and safe for a child:

1. **Placement of an epinephrine gauze in the left nostril (C)** - This is typically a more advanced intervention and not usually the first step in a simple anterior epistaxis.
  
2. **Anterior packing and topical antibiotics (A)** - This may be appropriate for more severe or recurrent cases but is not the immediate first-line treatment for a straightforward case.

3. **Squeezing the nostrils manually for 10 minutes with the head elevated (E)** - This is a standard first-aid measure for managing anterior nosebleeds and is appropriate for initial therapy.

4. **Silver nitrate cauterization of the bleeding vessel and surrounding vessels (D)** - This is typically performed after conservative measures have failed, not as an initial step.

5. **Oxymetazoline nasal spray (B)** - This can help constrict blood vessels and might be useful, but it is not the first-line initial measure.

Given that the immediate and appropriate action for managing a straightforward anterior nosebleed in a child is to apply pressure, the best answer is:

**Answer: (E) Squeezing the nostrils manually for 10 minutes with the head elevated.**
Path 6: Let's think step by step about the management of epistaxis (nosebleed) in this case.

1. **Patient Profile**: The patient is a 12-year-old boy with spontaneous nosebleed from the left nostril, with no significant medical history or family history of bleeding disorders.
  
2. **Physical Examination**: The examination indicates persistent bleeding from the left nostril without any bleeding from the right nostril, suggesting a localized issue, likely an anterior nasal bleed.

3. **Initial Management for Nosebleeds**: The initial management of a nosebleed typically involves manual pressure and positioning. The recommended approach is to have the patient pinch their nostrils together and lean forward to prevent blood from flowing down the throat and to promote clotting.

4. **Evaluating the Options**:
   - (C) Placement of an epinephrine gauze in the left nostril: This is more advanced management.
   - (A) Anterior packing and topical antibiotics: This is also a more advanced intervention.
   - (E) Squeezing the nostrils manually for 10 minutes with the head elevated: This is consistent with standard first-aid measures for managing a nosebleed.
   - (D) Silver nitrate cauterization: This is generally done after initial management fails.
   - (B) Oxymetazoline nasal spray: This can be used for vasoconstriction but is not the first-line immediate measure.

5. **Conclusion**: The most appropriate initial therapy in this situation is to manually squeeze the nostrils and have the patient lean forward for 10 minutes, which is the standard initial treatment for an acute epistaxis.

Answer: (E) Squeezing the nostrils manually for 10 minutes with the head elevated.
Path 7: Let's think step by step. The patient is a 12-year-old boy experiencing a spontaneous nosebleed (epistaxis) from his left nostril, which is a common occurrence in children. The initial management of a nosebleed typically includes:

1. **Manual compression**: The patient is already pressing a gauze against his nose, which is good. However, the standard recommendation is to pinch the nostrils together and lean slightly forward to minimize swallowing blood and to apply pressure for about 10 minutes.

2. **Head positioning**: The hyperextension of the head is not recommended as it can lead to swallowing blood which may cause nausea.

Given these considerations, the most appropriate initial therapy, which aligns with standard recommendations for managing epistaxis, is to have the patient squeeze the nostrils manually for 10 minutes with the head elevated.

Thus, the answer is:
(E) Squeezing the nostrils manually for 10 minutes with the head elevated.
Path 8: Let's think through the scenario step by step. The patient is a 12-year-old boy with spontaneous nosebleeding (epistaxis) from the left nostril. There are no signs of systemic bleeding disorders or other concerning symptoms, and this is his first episode.

In the case of anterior epistaxis, which is the most common type of nosebleed in children, initial management typically involves conservative measures. The standard recommendation is to have the patient pinch their nostrils together for about 10 minutes while sitting upright and leaning slightly forward. This helps to compress the nasal blood vessels and can often stop the bleeding.

While options like placement of gauze with epinephrine or cauterization can be considered in certain cases, they are not the first-line initial therapy, especially in a child with isolated anterior epistaxis.

Given this information, the most appropriate initial therapy for this patient is:

Answer: (E) Squeezing the nostrils manually for 10 minutes with the head elevated.
Path 9: Let's think through the situation step by step.

The patient is a 12-year-old boy experiencing spontaneous nasal bleeding from the left nostril without any previous episodes or significant medical history. The bleeding is persistent, and he is currently applying pressure to the affected nostril. 

The most appropriate initial therapy for a case of anterior epistaxis (nosebleed) is to apply direct pressure to the nostrils. The recommendation for managing a nosebleed is to pinch the nostrils together (squeezing) and lean forward to prevent blood from flowing down the throat, ideally for about 10 minutes.

Considering the options provided:

- (C) Placement of an epinephrine gauze in the left nostril: This is more invasive and typically reserved for more severe or refractory cases.
- (A) Anterior packing and topical antibiotics: This is also more invasive and typically done if initial measures fail.
- (E) Squeezing the nostrils manually for 10 minutes with the head elevated: This is the standard first-line treatment for a nosebleed.
- (D) Silver nitrate cauterization of the bleeding vessel and surrounding vessels: This is usually done if the bleeding persists after initial management.
- (B) Oxymetazoline nasal spray: This can be used to help constrict blood vessels, but the immediate and most effective action is applying direct pressure.

Therefore, the most appropriate initial therapy is to manually squeeze the nostrils while elevating the head.

Answer: (E) Squeezing the nostrils manually for 10 minutes with the head elevated.
Path 10: In this case, the boy has a spontaneous nosebleed (epistaxis) with unilateral bleeding from the left nostril. The initial management of a simple anterior epistaxis involves conservative measures. 

The most appropriate initial therapy in this scenario would be:

(E) Squeezing the nostrils manually for 10 minutes with the head elevated. 

This method helps to apply pressure directly to the site of bleeding, which can often stop the bleeding without the need for more invasive procedures. If the bleeding does not stop after this initial intervention, further treatments such as nasal packing or cauterization can be considered.
[INFO] Final decision by majority voting

Reason: The correct answer to the question should actually be identified as (E) Subarachnoid hemorrhage if that is provided as the option, but based on the context and the typical risk factors for normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), which this patient seems to have, there are actually more commonly linked risk factors than subarachnoid hemorrhage. 

Subarachnoid hemorrhage can lead to complications including NPH, due to the interruption of cerebrospinal fluid absorption, making it a potential risk factor for the condition. The presentation of this patient, including gait disturbance, cognitive changes, and MRI findings, are characteristic of NPH, which has underlying causes that can include previous brain hemorrhages.
Answer: (E) Subarachnoid hemorrhage

Question: A 21-year-old woman is brought to the clinic for evaluation by her brother. The patient’s brother says that, 3 days ago, the patient had put on her best pantsuit and makeup and insisted that she was returning to work and driving to Seattle to take over for the CEO of the Amazon Corporation. He says this was especially odd because her husband was just killed in an automobile accident in a different city 2 days ago. Today, the patient’s brother says she was saddened, wearing grey jogging pants. The patient says she does not recall acting odd and does remember that her husband is dead. Her vital signs include: blood pressure 132/84 mm Hg, pulse 92/min, respiratory rate 16/min, temperature 37.4°C (99.4°F). Upon physical examination, the patient’s affect is saddened but her speech rate and volume are normal. There is no hallucinations, mania, interruptive speech, depressive symptoms, or loss of interest in activities once enjoyed. Results of urine drug screen are provided below:
Amphetamine negative
Benzodiazepine negative

Which of the following best describes the patient’s state? (B) Schizoid personality disorder (E) Brief psychotic disorder (C) Borderline personality disorder (D) Schizotypal personality disorder (A) Schizoaffective disorder
Reason: The correct answer is (E) Brief psychotic disorder based on the patient's sudden onset of unusual behavior, specifically her grandiose beliefs about returning to work and taking on a high-profile position shortly after experiencing a significant personal loss (the death of her husband). 

Brief psychotic disorder can occur in response to extreme stressors, and the patient’s behavior changes—particularly her manic-like symptoms immediately following a traumatic event—fit this diagnosis. The disorder is characterized by the presence of delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, or grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior that persists for at least one day but less than one month, making her case align with this condition.
Answer: (E) Brief psychotic disorder

Question: A 47-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 7-week history of cough, shortness of breath, and daily copious sputum production. He has had frequent respiratory tract infections over the past several years. Current medications include dextromethorphan and guaifenesin as needed. He does not smoke cigarettes. His temperature is 37.1°C (98.8°F), pulse is 88/min, respirations are 21/min, and blood pressure is 133/84 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 95%. Diffuse crackles and wheezing are heard on auscultation over bilateral lung fields. A CT scan of the chest is shown. The patient is at greatest risk for which of the following complications? (B) Infection with Rhizopus species (E) Dysfunction of left ventricle (D) Neoplastic growth of pleural cells (C) Rupture of pulmonary blebs (A) Damage to bronchial vessels
Reason: The correct answer is (A) Damage to bronchial vessels, as the scenario describes a patient with chronic productive cough and recurrent respiratory infections, which can lead to structural changes in the airways and adjacent vessels, primarily due to chronic inflammation and possible bronchiectasis.

Patients with chronic lung conditions often develop damage to bronchial vessels as a result of ongoing inflammation and infection, which can result in complications such as hemoptysis or increased risk for further respiratory issues. In this context, the patient’s history and symptoms suggest underlying airway pathology that predisposes him to vascular complications in the lungs.
Answer: (A) Damage to bronchial vessels

Question: A 2500-g (5-lb 8-oz) female newborn delivered at 37 weeks' gestation develops rapid breathing, grunting, and subcostal retractions shortly after birth. Despite appropriate lifesaving measures, the newborn dies 2 hours later. Autopsy shows bilateral renal agenesis. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this newborn's respiratory distress? (B) Injury to the diaphragmatic innervation (A) Decreased amniotic fluid ingestion (E) Surfactant inactivation and epithelial inflammation (C) Displacement of intestines into the pleural cavity (D) Collapse of the supraglottic airway
Reason: The correct answer is (A) Decreased amniotic fluid ingestion. The newborn's respiratory distress is likely due to oligohydramnios caused by bilateral renal agenesis, which affects the production of amniotic fluid. This lack of fluid leads to lung underdevelopment and complications like pulmonary hypoplasia, resulting in respiratory issues at birth.
Answer: (A) Decreased amniotic fluid ingestion

Question: An otherwise healthy 45-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-week history of an itchy rash on her left nipple. The rash began as small vesicles on the nipple and spread to the areola. It has become a painful ulcer with yellow, watery discharge that is occasionally blood-tinged. She has asthma treated with theophylline and inhaled salbutamol. Her younger sister was diagnosed with endometrial cancer a year ago. Examination shows a weeping, ulcerated lesion involving the entire left nipple-areolar complex. There are no breast masses, dimpling, or axillary lymphadenopathy. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? (B) Mastitis (A) Inflammatory breast cancer (D) Breast fibroadenoma (C) Breast abscess (E) Paget disease of the breast
"
Reason: The correct answer is (E) Paget disease of the breast. The presentation of an itchy rash that evolves into a painful ulcer on the nipple with yellow discharge is characteristic of Paget disease, which involves the nipple and is associated with underlying breast malignancy. Given the patient's symptoms, the ulceration, and the family history of endometrial cancer, Paget disease is the most likely diagnosis to explain the changes observed.

Question: While at the emergency room, a 43-year-old woman starts experiencing progressive chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, palpitations, bilateral arm numbness, and a feeling that she is choking. She originally came to the hospital after receiving the news that her husband was injured in a car accident. The symptoms began 5 minutes ago. The patient has had two episodes involving similar symptoms in the past month. In both cases, symptoms resolved after approximately 10 minutes with no sequelae. She has no history of serious illness. Her father had a myocardial infarction at the age of 60 years. She is allergic to amoxicillin, cats, and pollen. She is 170 cm (5 ft 7 in) tall and weighs 52 kg (115 lb); BMI is 18 kg/m2. She appears distressed and is diaphoretic. Physical examination shows no other abnormalities. 12-lead ECG shows sinus tachycardia with a shortened QT interval and an isoelectric ST segment. Urine toxicology screening is negative. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? (E) Administer clonazepam (C) Order echocardiogram (D) Administer nebulized albuterol (B) Order thyroid function tests (A) Order D-dimers
Reason: The patient’s symptoms, including chest pain, shortness of breath, and feelings of choking, occurring after receiving distressing news, suggest she may be experiencing a panic attack. Given her history of similar episodes that resolved quickly, administering clonazepam can provide rapid relief of acute anxiety symptoms, making it the most appropriate next step in management. Additionally, the acute presentation with no significant findings on the ECG or toxicology supports a psychiatric rather than a primary cardiac issue in this scenario.

Question: A 35-year-old female presents to her gynecologist complaining of vaginal discomfort. She reports that over the past two weeks, she has developed dyspareunia and feels as if there is a mass on the external aspect of her vagina. She is sexually active in a monogamous relationship. On physical examination, there is a 2 cm unilateral erythematous swelling on the right side of the posterolateral labia minora. Which of the following embryologic precursors gives rise to the affected tissue in this patient? (C) Urogenital sinus (B) Genital tubercle (D) Urogenital fold (E) Labioscrotal swelling (A) Paramesonephric duct
Reason: The answer is (C) Urogenital sinus. The swelling in this patient, which is likely a result of inflammation or obstruction of the Bartholin's gland located in the labia minora, is derived from the urogenital sinus during embryological development. The urogenital sinus forms parts of the female reproductive tract, including the lower vagina, making it the correct precursor associated with the affected tissue.

Question: An 85-year-old man with hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus is brought to the emergency department because of a 2-day history of shortness of breath. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 30 years. His temperature is 36.9°C (98.4°F), pulse is 100/min, respirations are 30/min, and blood pressure is 138/75 mm Hg. Pulmonary function testing shows decreased tidal volume and normal lung compliance. Which of the following is the most likely underlying etiology of this patient's tachypnea? (E) Pulmonary edema (D) Rib fracture (A) Emphysema exacerbation (B) Tension pneumothorax (C) Diabetic ketoacidosis
Reason: The answer is (D) Rib fracture. In elderly patients, rib fractures can occur with minimal trauma and often lead to pain with breathing, resulting in a decreased tidal volume and increased respiratory rate (tachypnea) as the patient attempts to compensate for discomfort. The patient's history of smoking and age may contribute to fragility, making rib fractures a likely cause of his shortness of breath despite the absence of signs typical for conditions such as pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.

Question: A 34-year-old woman presents with acute onset loss of vision and visual disturbances. She says that, several hours ago, her vision began to get dim, and she sees halos around light sources. This was immediately followed by a severe frontal headache. Past medical history is significant for epilepsy. The patient says her anticonvulsant medication was changed recently but she doesn’t remember the name. Slit-lamp examination reveals mild chemosis, injection, and ciliary flush with diffuse stromal haze, along with very shallow peripheral anterior chambers with areas of iridocorneal touch in both eyes. Gonioscopy showed closed angles bilaterally. Which of the following antiepileptic drugs is most likely responsible for this patient’s condition? (B) Topiramate (C) Gabapentin (E) Tiagabine (A) Lamotrigine (D) Zonisamide
Reason: Topiramate is known to potentially cause secondary angle-closure glaucoma as a side effect, particularly due to its mechanism of action which can lead to changes in the eyes' structure, specifically the drainage angle. The patient's presentation with acute onset vision loss, halos around lights, severe headache, and findings of closed angles on gonioscopy aligns well with such a diagnosis, suggesting that topiramate is the likely culprit in her condition.

Question: An investigator is studying severely ill patients who experience hypoglycemia and ketonuria during times of fasting. The investigator determines that during these episodes, amino acids liberated from muscle proteins are metabolized to serve as substrates for gluconeogenesis. Nitrogen from this process is transported to the liver primarily in the form of which of the following molecules? (B) Arginine (A) Pyruvate (C) Alanine (D) α-ketoglutarate (E) Glutamate
Reason: During fasting states, muscle protein breakdown releases amino acids, and alanine plays a key role in gluconeogenesis by transporting nitrogen to the liver. Specifically, alanine is transaminated to pyruvate and can enter gluconeogenic pathways, making it a primary carrier of nitrogen from peripheral tissues to the liver during hypoglycemic conditions.

Question: A 7-year-old girl is brought to the physician by her mother because she has been increasingly reluctant to speak at school over the past 4 months. Her teachers complain that she does not answer their questions and it is affecting her academic performance. She was born at 35 weeks' gestation and pregnancy was complicated by preeclampsia. Previous well-child examinations have been normal. Her older brother was diagnosed with a learning disability 4 years ago. She is at 65th percentile for height and weight. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. She follows commands. She avoids answering questions directly and whispers her answers to her mother instead who then mediates between the doctor and her daughter. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? (E) Rett syndrome (C) Social anxiety disorder (D) Selective mutism (A) Reactive attachment disorder (B) Autism spectrum disorder
Reason: The child's reluctance to speak at school despite being able to communicate with her mother suggests a specific condition known as selective mutism, often characterized by an inability to speak in certain social settings. This condition typically occurs in children who are otherwise capable of verbal communication and is often linked to anxiety in social situations rather than a lack of ability to speak.

Question: A 42-year-old woman with well-controlled HIV on antiretroviral therapy comes to the physician because of a 2-week history of a painless lesion on her right calf. Many years ago, she had a maculopapular rash over her trunk, palms, and soles that resolved spontaneously. Physical examination shows a 4-cm firm, non-tender, indurated ulcer with a moist, dark base and rolled edges. There is a similar lesion at the anus. Results of rapid plasma reagin testing are positive. Which of the following findings is most likely on microscopic examination of these lesions? (E) Coagulative necrosis surrounded by fibroblast and macrophage infiltrate (A) Epithelioid cell infiltrate surrounding acellular, granular core (D) Ulcerated epidermis with plasma cell infiltrate (C) Lichenoid hyperplasia with superficial neutrophilic infiltrate (B) Epidermal hyperplasia with dermal lymphocytic infiltrate
Reason: The most likely finding on microscopic examination of these lesions is coagulative necrosis surrounded by fibroblast and macrophage infiltrate (E). This is consistent with the characteristics of a chancre that may arise in secondary syphilis, given the patient's positive rapid plasma reagin testing and clinical presentation of the lesions, which can demonstrate necrosis as part of the inflammatory response. Additionally, the history of a previous rash and the painless indurated ulcer on the calf further align with the typical progression and histopathological features of syphilitic lesions.
Answer: (E) Coagulative necrosis surrounded by fibroblast and macrophage infiltrate

[INFO] Opinion paths:
Path 1: In this case, the patient has a positive RPR and confirmed positive FTA-ABS, indicating he has syphilis. Given that he has a CD4 count of 175, he is at risk for opportunistic infections, and syphilis can lead to neurological complications, especially in the context of HIV. However, since the patient is asymptomatic and has a normal neurological examination, the immediate next step in management is to treat the syphilis.

For a patient with a titer of 1:64, this suggests early syphilis (primary or secondary), for which treatment would typically involve a single dose of benzathine penicillin G. After treatment, follow-up titers are necessary to assess the response to therapy.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is:

**Answer: (D) Treat with a single injection of penicillin, obtain titers in 3 months.**
Path 2: Let's analyze the situation step by step.

The patient is a 33-year-old man with a new diagnosis of HIV, presenting with Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, and has tested positive for syphilis (RPR positive with a titer of 1:64, confirmed with FTA-ABS). Given that he is asymptomatic and has a normal neurological examination, there is no evidence of neurosyphilis at this time.

In managing syphilis, the treatment approach depends on the stage of the disease and the patient's clinical status. Since there is no mention of neurological symptoms and no signs of neurosyphilis, the patient can be treated for early syphilis. The standard treatment for early syphilis is a single injection of benzathine penicillin G.

Given all of this information, the most appropriate next step in management is:

**(E) Treat with a single injection of penicillin, obtain titers in 6 months.**

This option is appropriate because it aligns with the treatment guidelines for early syphilis, and follow-up titers in 6 months will help assess the treatment response.
Path 3: Let's analyze the situation step by step.

The patient has been diagnosed with syphilis, confirmed by both a positive RPR and a positive FTA-ABS. Given his CD4 count of 175, he is at risk for opportunistic infections and complications related to HIV. However, he currently shows no neurological symptoms, and his neurological examination is normal.

In cases of syphilis, the treatment approach depends on the stage of the disease. Since the patient does not have any symptoms suggestive of neurosyphilis (normal neurological exam), it is reasonable to assume he may have early latent syphilis or secondary syphilis, given the positive RPR.

For early latent or secondary syphilis, the standard treatment is a single injection of benzathine penicillin G. Follow-up with titers is typically done to assess treatment response.

Now, considering the treatment options:

(A) Perform lumbar puncture, treat based on presence or absence of CNS disease - This is not necessary since the patient does not have neurological symptoms.

(B) Treat with three weekly injections of penicillin, obtain titers in 3 months - This is typically for late latent or tertiary syphilis, which does not apply here.

(C) Treat with three weekly injections of penicillin, obtain titers in 6 months - Again, this is not appropriate for early latent or secondary syphilis.

(D) Treat with a single injection of penicillin, obtain titers in 3 months - This is the correct approach for early latent syphilis.

(E) Treat with a single injection of penicillin, obtain titers in 6 months - This is less common; follow-up titers are usually checked sooner.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management for this patient is:

**Answer: (D) Treat with a single injection of penicillin, obtain titers in 3 months.**
Path 4: Let's analyze the question step by step.

1. **Patient Background**: The patient is a 33-year-old man with a new diagnosis of HIV (CD4 count of 175) and a positive RPR confirmed with a positive FTA-ABS for syphilis. He is asymptomatic and has a normal neurological examination.

2. **Syphilis Staging**: Given that the titer is 1:64, this suggests a significant infection, but the absence of neurological symptoms and a normal neurological examination implies that he likely does not have neurosyphilis.

3. **Treatment Guidelines**: For primary or secondary syphilis, the standard treatment is a single injection of benzathine penicillin G. For latent syphilis or if there is any concern for late syphilis, treatment may involve more frequent injections over several weeks.

4. **Next Steps**: Since the patient is asymptomatic with a normal neurological exam, and assuming he has early syphilis (given the positive RPR and FTA-ABS without symptoms), the treatment of choice would be a single injection of penicillin. 

5. **Follow-Up**: After treatment, the titers should be monitored to assess treatment response, usually at 6 months for primary or secondary syphilis. 

Given all these considerations, the most appropriate next step in management is:

**Answer: (E) Treat with a single injection of penicillin, obtain titers in 6 months.**
Path 5: Let's think through the case step by step. 

The patient has a recent diagnosis of HIV with a CD4 count of 175 and has tested positive for syphilis (RPR positive with titer 1:64 and confirmed with FTA-ABS). Given his CD4 count, he is at risk for complications from syphilis and may have early latent syphilis.

In HIV-infected patients with syphilis, particularly when the CD4 count is below 350, treatment is generally approached with caution. The standard treatment for early syphilis is a single injection of benzathine penicillin G. However, in HIV-infected individuals, it is recommended to monitor closely for potential neurological involvement, especially since the patient is asymptomatic but has a significant risk for neurosyphilis.

Since he has no neurological symptoms and the lumbar puncture is not indicated at this time (as he shows no signs of CNS involvement), the most appropriate management step is to treat with a single injection of penicillin and obtain titers in 3 months. This allows for appropriate follow-up to ensure treatment efficacy and monitor for any potential complications.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
(D) Treat with a single injection of penicillin, obtain titers in 3 months.
Path 6: Let's analyze the case step by step:

1. The patient has been diagnosed with Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia and HIV, with a CD4 count of 175, indicating that he is immunocompromised.
2. He has a positive RPR with a titer of 1:64 and a confirmed positive FTA-ABS, which indicates he has syphilis.
3. The patient is asymptomatic neurologically, and his neurological examination is normal.

Given these factors, the most appropriate next step in management for this patient with syphilis is to treat the syphilis. 

For an HIV-positive patient with a newly diagnosed syphilis infection (especially at a titer of 1:64), the standard treatment is to administer benzathine penicillin G. The recommendation is typically to give a single injection of penicillin for early syphilis or for primary or secondary syphilis. However, given the positive FTA-ABS and the patient's immunocompromised status, we should consider that he might have latent syphilis or early latent syphilis.

Since he is asymptomatic and has no neurological symptoms, lumbar puncture is not warranted at this stage according to standard guidelines.

The appropriate management in this case would be to treat with a single injection of penicillin and obtain titers in 3 months. This approach is consistent with treating early syphilis or latent syphilis in an HIV-positive patient.

Thus, the answer is:
(D) Treat with a single injection of penicillin, obtain titers in 3 months.
Path 7: Let's think step by step.

In this scenario, the patient has a positive RPR and FTA-ABS, indicating active syphilis. Given that he has a new diagnosis of HIV with a CD4 count of 175, he is at increased risk for complications associated with syphilis, including neurosyphilis or other systemic effects.

The most appropriate management for a patient with syphilis and HIV, particularly when neurological examination is normal and there are no symptoms of neurosyphilis, involves treating the syphilis according to its stage. However, given that the exact stage is not specified in the question, we will proceed with standard treatment for early syphilis, which is typically a single injection of benzathine penicillin G.

After treatment, it is essential to monitor the titers to assess the response to therapy. In this case, the titers should be obtained at 3 months as this is the standard follow-up period for patients treated for syphilis.

Based on these considerations, the most appropriate next step in management is:

**Answer: (D) Treat with a single injection of penicillin, obtain titers in 3 months.**
Path 8: Let's think through the clinical scenario step by step:

1. **Patient Background**: The patient is a 33-year-old man with a recent diagnosis of HIV and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). His CD4 count is 175, which indicates that he is at risk for opportunistic infections, but he does not currently have symptoms of neurosyphilis based on the normal neurological exam.

2. **Syphilis Diagnosis**: The patient has a positive RPR and a confirmed positive FTA-ABS, indicating that he has syphilis. The titer of 1:64 is significant and suggests a more recent or active infection.

3. **Management Guidelines**: In patients with HIV, especially with CD4 counts below 350, the management of syphilis typically involves more aggressive treatment. The standard treatment for early syphilis (primary, secondary, or early latent syphilis) in adults is a single injection of benzathine penicillin G.

4. **Follow-Up**: After treatment, it is recommended to follow up with serologic testing to monitor the response to treatment. In this case, given the patient's HIV status and the positive syphilis test, appropriate follow-up is crucial.

5. **Treatment Choice**: Since the patient does not present with neurological symptoms and there is no indication of tertiary syphilis or neurosyphilis, the appropriate management would be to treat with a single injection of penicillin. After treatment, obtaining titers in 3 months is standard practice to assess treatment efficacy.

Given this reasoning, the most appropriate next step in management is:

**(D) Treat with a single injection of penicillin, obtain titers in 3 months.**
Path 9: Let's think through the details provided in the question step by step.

1. **Patient Background**: The patient is a 33-year-old man with a recent diagnosis of HIV, presenting with Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia and a positive RPR (Rapid Plasma Reagin) with a titer of 1:64, confirmed by a positive FTA-ABS (Fluorescent Treponemal Antibody Absorption).

2. **Understanding Syphilis Treatment**: The RPR titer of 1:64 indicates a likely case of syphilis. The treatment for syphilis, particularly when the patient is asymptomatic and there are no signs of neurological involvement, typically follows the guidelines based on the stage of syphilis. For early syphilis, the recommended treatment is a single dose of benzathine penicillin G.

3. **Assessing for CNS Involvement**: The patient has a normal neurological examination and no symptoms that suggest central nervous system (CNS) involvement. In asymptomatic syphilis cases, especially with a CD4 count above 200, lumbar puncture is not routinely performed unless there are neurological signs or symptoms.

4. **Follow-Up and Treatment Protocol**: Given that he is asymptomatic and based on the positive RPR and FTA-ABS, the appropriate management in this scenario would be to treat with a single injection of penicillin and then monitor the titers.

5. **Conclusion**: The most appropriate next step in management is to treat with a single injection of penicillin and obtain titers in 3 months to assess response to treatment.

Answer: (D) Treat with a single injection of penicillin, obtain titers in 3 months.
Path 10: In this case, the patient has a positive RPR and a confirmed positive FTA-ABS, indicating that he has syphilis. Given his CD4 count of 175 and the fact that he is asymptomatic with a normal neurological examination, he is likely in the early stages of syphilis, possibly primary or secondary syphilis.

For an HIV-positive patient with early syphilis (primary or secondary), the standard treatment is a single injection of benzathine penicillin G. 

However, it is important to monitor the response to treatment. In this scenario, following treatment, titers should be obtained in 3 months to assess the response.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is:

**(D) Treat with a single injection of penicillin, obtain titers in 3 months.**

Question: A 26-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with confusion, severe myalgia, fever, and a rash over her inner left thigh. The patient was diagnosed with pharyngitis three days ago and prescribed antibiotics, but she did not take them. Her blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg, heart rate is 99/min, respiratory rate is 17/min, and temperature is 38.9°C (102.0°F). On physical examination, the patient is disoriented. The posterior wall of her pharynx is erythematous and swollen and protrudes into the pharyngeal lumen. There is a diffuse maculopapular rash over her thighs and abdomen. Which of these surface structures interacts with the causative agent of her condition? (C) CD1 (A) Variable part of TCR β-chain (B) CD3 (D) Constant part of TCR α-chain (E) CD4
Reason: The answer is (A) Variable part of TCR β-chain because the symptoms and presentation suggest a form of toxic shock syndrome, which is often associated with superantigens. These superantigens directly interact with the variable regions of T-cell receptors (TCRs), leading to atypical activation of T-cells. In this case, specifically, the variable part of the TCR β-chain is crucial for recognizing superantigens from certain bacterial toxins.
Answer: (A) Variable part of TCR β-chain

Question: A 36-year-old man presents with the complaint of loose and watery stools for the past 3 days. He is now having bowel movements four to five times a day. He denies any blood or mucus in the stool. He also complains of abdominal pain and fatigue. Furthermore, he feels nauseous and does not feel like drinking anything. His urine is visibly yellow and low in volume. He recently returned from a trip to South America where he enjoyed all the local delicacies. He is most concerned about his urine color and volume. Which segment of the nephron is primarily responsible for these changes? (A) Glomerulus (B) Proximal convoluted tubule (E) Distal tubule (D) Loop of Henle (C) Proximal straight tubule
Reason: The answer is (D) Loop of Henle because this segment of the nephron plays a crucial role in concentrating urine and maintaining water balance. In the setting of dehydration, such as that potentially caused by diarrhea and decreased fluid intake, the Loop of Henle helps to reabsorb more water from the filtrate, resulting in a lower volume and more concentrated urine, which explains the man's concerns about his urine color and volume.
Answer: (D) Loop of Henle

Question: A 3500-g (7.7-lbs) girl is delivered at 39 weeks' gestation to a 27-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1. Apgar scores are 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. The mother had regular prenatal visits throughout the pregnancy. She did not smoke or drink alcohol. She took multivitamins as prescribed by her physician. The newborn appears active. The girl's temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 120/min, and blood pressure is 55/35 mm Hg. Examination in the delivery room shows clitoromegaly. One day later, laboratory studies show:
Hemoglobin 12.8 g/dL
Leukocyte count 6,000/mm3
Platelet count 240,000/mm3
Serum
Na+ 133 mEq/L
K+ 5.2 mEq/L
Cl− 101 mEq/L
HCO3− 21 mEq/L
Urea nitrogen 15 mg/dL
Creatinine 0.8 mg/dL
Ultrasound of the abdomen and pelvis shows normal uterus and normal ovaries. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this newborn patient?" (E) Spironolactone therapy (D) Dexamethasone therapy (C) Genital reconstruction surgery (A) Hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone therapy (B) Estrogen replacement therapy
Reason: The answer is (A) Hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone therapy because the newborn's presentation, including clitoromegaly and electrolyte abnormalities, suggests a potential case of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), most commonly due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency. In cases of CAH, immediate replacement therapy with glucocorticoids (hydrocortisone) and mineralocorticoids (fludrocortisone) is essential to correct cortisol deficiency and manage electrolyte imbalances, thereby preventing adrenal crisis.
Answer: (A) Hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone therapy

Question: An 80-year-old man comes to the office for evaluation of anemia. His medical history is relevant for end-stage renal disease and aortic stenosis. When questioned about his bowel movements, the patient mentions that he has occasional episodes of loose, black, tarry stools. His heart rate is 78/min, respiratory rate is 17/min, temperature is 36.6°C (97.8°F), and blood pressure is 80/60 mm Hg. Physical examination shows pale skin and conjunctiva and orthostasis upon standing. A complete blood count shows his hemoglobin is 8.7 g/dL, hematocrit is 27%, and mean corpuscular volume is 76 μm3. A colonoscopy is obtained. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient’s current condition? (E) Colonic polyps (B) Colorectal cancer (C) Ischemic colitis (A) Angiodysplasia (D) Portal hypertension
Reason: The most likely cause of this patient's current condition is angiodysplasia. Angiodysplasia is a vascular lesion that can lead to gastrointestinal bleeding, particularly in older patients, which aligns with the patient's presentation of anemia, melena (black tarry stools), and the age-related vascular changes. Given the patient's end-stage renal disease, he is at increased risk for these vascular malformations, which explains the low hemoglobin and hematocrit levels observed in his complete blood count.
Answer: (A) Angiodysplasia

Question: A 52-year-old male with ischemic cardiomyopathy presents to his cardiologist for worsening shortness of breath on exertion. He denies any recent episodes of chest pain and has been compliant with his medications, which include metoprolol, lisinopril, spironolactone, and furosemide. The patient’s vitals signs are as follows: Temperature is 98.7 deg F (37.1 deg C), blood pressure is 163/78 mmHg, pulse is 92/min, respirations are 14/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. A repeat echocardiogram reveals a stable LVEF of 25-35%. The physician decides to start hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate. Which of the following is true regarding this medication combination? (B) Increases the volume of blood that enters the heart to improve ventricular contraction (C) Improves symptoms but do not have an overall mortality benefit in patients with congestive heart failure (D) Decreases the volume and work placed on the left ventricle (E) Has positive effects on cardiac remodeling (A) Has anti-inflammatory properties to reduce the risk of coronary artery thrombosis
Reason: The combination of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate (also known as a fixed-dose combination) decreases the volume and workload on the left ventricle. Hydralazine is a vasodilator that reduces systemic vascular resistance (afterload), while isosorbide dinitrate dilates venous capacitance vessels, decreasing preload; together, they lead to reduced cardiac filling pressures and improved symptoms in heart failure patients. This combination helps relieve some of the burden on the heart, particularly in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.
Answer: (D) Decreases the volume and work placed on the left ventricle

Question: A 51-year-old African American man presents to his primary care physician’s office for an annual visit. He has no major concerns and says that he has been healthy for the last year. His past medical history is significant for diabetes as well as long standing hypertension that has developed gradually since his 30's; however, he has refused to take any medications. Physical exam shows no abnormal findings. Routine laboratory testing reveals the following:

Serum creatinine concentration: 1.5 mg/dL
Blood urea nitrogen: 31 mg/dL

Based on these results, urine studies are conducted that reveal mild proteinuria of less than 1 g/day and no casts.

Which of the following is most likely associated with the cause of this patient's elevated creatinine? (B) Cobblestone kidney (E) String of beads on angiography (D) Renal cortex necrosis (C) Kimmelstiel-Wilson lesions (A) Apple-green birefringent lesions
Reason: The patient's elevated creatinine can be associated with "cobblestone kidney," which is a term used to describe the appearance of renal imaging findings in patients with hypertensive nephrosclerosis. Given this patient's long-standing hypertension and mild proteinuria, the renal changes associated with chronic hypertension, such as diffuse hyaline arteriosclerosis leading to a cobblestone appearance of the renal surface, are likely contributors to his renal impairment.
Answer: (B) Cobblestone kidney

Question: A 6-month-old male presents for a routine visit to his pediatrician. Two months ago, the patient was seen for tachypnea and wheezing, and diagnosed with severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis. After admission to the hospital and supportive care, the patient recovered and currently is not experiencing any trouble breathing. Regarding the possible of future reactive airway disease, which of the following statements is most accurate? (C) “Your child has a less than 5% chance of developing asthma” (E) “Your child’s risk of asthma is less than the general population.” (D) “Your child has a greater than 20% chance of developing asthma” (B) “There is no clear relationship between RSV and the development of asthma.” (A) “Your child’s risk of asthma is the same as the general population.”
Reason: In young children who have experienced severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis, research indicates a significant association between this viral infection and an increased risk of developing asthma later in life. Studies have shown that these children are more likely to exhibit reactive airway disease, and the likelihood can exceed 20%, particularly in those with a history of severe bronchiolitis.

Question: A researcher wants to study the carcinogenic effects of a food additive. From the literature, he finds that 7 different types of cancers have been linked to the consumption of this food additive. He wants to study all 7 possible outcomes. He conducts interviews with people who consume food containing these additives and people who do not. He then follows both groups for several years to see if they develop any of these 7 cancers or any other health outcomes. Which of the following study models best represents this study? (B) Cohort study  (D) Crossover study (C) Randomized clinical trial  (A) Case-control study  (E) Cross-sectional study
Reason: A cohort study is designed to follow a group of individuals over time to observe outcomes based on their exposure status—in this case, whether they consume the food additive or not. By tracking both groups for several years to see if they develop any of the 7 cancers or other health outcomes, the researcher effectively utilizes the cohort study model to assess the long-term effects of the additive on cancer risk.

Question: A 67-year-old man presents to the surgical clinic with swelling of his right leg, fever, and chills for 2 days. The maximum recorded temperature was 38.3°C (101.0°F) at home. His right leg is red and swollen from the dorsum of the foot to the thigh with an ill-defined edge. Venous stasis ulcers are present in both of his limbs, but those on the right have a yellow discharge. His vitals include the following: blood pressure is 120/78 mm Hg, heart rate is 94/min, temperature is 38.3°C (101.0°F), and respiratory rate is 16/min. On physical examination, there is tenderness and warmth compared with his normal leg. Dorsalis pedis pulses are present on both of the ankles. What is the most likely cause of the right shift of the hemoglobin dissociation curve for his condition? (B) Decrease in 2,3-DPG (C) Increase in temperature (A) Increase in pH (D) Decrease in temperature (E) Increase in CO production
Reason: An increase in temperature typically causes a rightward shift of the hemoglobin dissociation curve, facilitating the release of oxygen from hemoglobin to the tissues. In this patient's case, the fever he is experiencing as part of his infection contributes to this physiological change, promoting oxygen delivery to inflamed and potentially hypoxic tissues in his swollen leg.
Answer: (C) Increase in temperature

Question: A 6-year-old right-handed boy is brought to the emergency department because of difficulty speaking and inability to raise his right arm. The patient’s mother says his symptoms started suddenly 1 hour ago and have not improved. She says he has never had these symptoms before. No other significant past medical history. The patient was born full-term via spontaneous transvaginal delivery and has met all developmental goals. The family immigrated from Nigeria 3 months ago, and the patient is currently following a vaccination catch-up schedule. His vital signs include: temperature 36.8°C (98.2°F), blood pressure 111/65 mm Hg, pulse 105/min. Height is at the 30th percentile and weight is at the 25th percentile for age and sex. Physical examination is remarkable for generalized pallor, pale conjunctiva, jaundice, and complete loss of strength in the right arm (0/5). His peripheral blood smear is shown in the picture. Which of the following is the most effective preventive measure for this patient’s condition? (C) Carotid endarterectomy (D) Regular blood transfusion (E) Oral penicillin VK (B) Aspirin (A) Warfarin
Reason: The sudden onset of difficulty speaking and inability to raise the right arm, along with the pallor and jaundice, suggests that the child may have experienced a stroke or a thromboembolic event, potentially likely related to a sickle cell crisis, especially considering the child's recent immigration from Nigeria, where sickle cell disease is prevalent. Regular blood transfusions are an effective preventive measure for individuals with sickle cell disease, as they can help reduce the risk of complications related to vaso-occlusive crises and ischemic events.

Question: A medical student is reviewing dose-response curves of various experimental drugs. She is specifically interested in the different factors that cause the curve to shift in different directions. From her study, she plots the following graph (see image). She marks the blue curve for drug A, which acts optimally on a receptor. After drawing the second (green) curve, she discovers that this drug B has a lower ability to produce a reaction than the first one. She also discovers that more of the second drug B is required to produce the same response as the first one. Which of the following terms best describes the activity of drug B in comparison to drug A? (A) Lower potency (E) Decreased efficacy (B) Higher efficacy (C) Higher potency (D) Increased affinity
Reason: The characterization of drug B as having "lower potency" compared to drug A is supported by the observation that drug B requires a higher concentration to achieve the same effect as drug A. Potency refers to the amount of drug needed to produce a specific effect; thus, if more of drug B is needed to reach the same response level as drug A, it indicates that drug B is less potent.
Answer: (A) Lower potency

Question: A 53-year-old female presents with worsening shortness of breath with activity. Physical exam reveals a diastolic murmur with an opening snap. The patient’s medical history is significant for a left hip replacement 10 years ago, and she vaguely recalls an extended period of illness as a child described as several severe episodes of sore throat followed by rash, fever, and joint pains. Administration of which of the following treatments at that time would have been most effective in reducing her risk of developing cardiac disease? (D) Aspirin (B) Penicillin (A) Acyclovir (E) Ciprofloxacin (C) Vancomycin
Reason: The patient's history of severe sore throats, rash, fever, and joint pains as a child is suggestive of rheumatic fever, a complication that can occur following streptococcal throat infections. Administering penicillin at that time would have been effective in treating the underlying streptococcal infection and would have significantly reduced her risk of developing rheumatic heart disease, which is often characterized by valvular heart issues, such as the diastolic murmur and opening snap noted in her examination.

Question: A 50-year-old man presents to a physician with recurrent episodes of coughing over the last 3 years. He mentions that his cough has been accompanied by expectoration during 5–6 consecutive months every year for the last 3 years and he experiences breathing difficulty on exertion. He has been a smoker for the last 10 years. There is no family history of allergy. He was prescribed inhaled corticosteroids and an inhaled bronchodilator 1 month previously, but there has been no improvement. There is no history of fever or breathing difficulty at present. On physical examination his temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), the pulse is 84/min, the blood pressure 126/84 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate is 20/min. Auscultation of his chest reveals coarse rhonchi and wheezing bilaterally. His sputum is mucoid and microscopic examination shows predominant macrophages. His chest radiogram (posteroanterior view) shows flattening of the diaphragm, increased bronchovascular markings, and mild cardiomegaly. If lung biopsy is carried out, which of the following microscopic findings is most likely to be present in this patient? (C) Hyperplasia of the mucus glands in the airways (B) Variable-sized cysts against a background of densely scarred lung tissue (D) Eosinophilic infiltration of the airways (E) Ossification of bronchial cartilage (A) Destruction of the pulmonary capillary bed
Reason: The most likely microscopic finding in this patient is hyperplasia of the mucus glands in the airways (C). This is consistent with chronic bronchitis, which is often seen in smokers and is characterized by inflammation and hypertrophy of the mucus-secreting glands, leading to increased mucus production and cough, as reflected in his symptoms and the findings of coarse rhonchi and mucoid sputum.
Answer: (C) Hyperplasia of the mucus glands in the airways

At the time of discharge, her heart configuration was normal, end-diastolic volume was 300 mL and ejection fraction was 51%. For the past 8 weeks she has noticed increasing shortness of breath while playing with her 2-year-old grandson. She feels otherwise well. She has arterial hypertension, coronary artery disease, and hypercholesterolemia. She admits to rarely taking her medication as she usually feels well and has no symptoms. Her temperature is 37.3°C (99.1°F), pulse is 93/min, and blood pressure is 142/93 mm Hg. Examination shows no abnormalities. A complete blood count and serum concentrations of electrolytes, urea nitrogen, and creatinine are within the reference range. ECG shows broad, deep Q waves and T-wave inversion. Echocardiography shows left ventricular dilation and an end-diastolic volume of 370 mL; Ejection fraction is 40%. Which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's worsening of ventricular function? (B) Nifedipine (A) Digoxin (E) Atorvastatin (D) Enalapril (C) Diltiazem
Reason: The most likely medication that could have prevented this patient's worsening of ventricular function is Enalapril (D). As an ACE inhibitor, Enalapril can help improve heart function and reduce ventricular remodeling by decreasing afterload and reducing the workload on the heart, which is particularly beneficial in patients with heart failure or reduced ejection fraction, like this patient, who has developed left ventricular dilation and a decrease in ejection fraction over time.
Answer: (D) Enalapril

Question: An investigator is studying a drug that acts on the thyroid hormone pathway. Levels of serum free T3 and T4 in healthy participants are measured before and after administration of the drug. After administration, there is a decrease in the average serum free T3 level, while the average serum free T4 level is increased compared to initial serum studies. Inhibition of which of the following is the most likely mechanism of action of this drug? (E) Peripheral 5'-deiodinase (B) Thyroid-stimulating hormone (D) Follicular thyroid peroxidase (C) Follicular iodotyrosine deiodinase (A) Follicular thyroid proteases
Reason: The answer is (E) Peripheral 5'-deiodinase because this enzyme is responsible for converting thyroxine (T4) into the more active form, triiodothyronine (T3) in peripheral tissues. A decrease in serum free T3 levels along with an increase in serum free T4 levels suggests that the drug inhibits the conversion process facilitated by peripheral 5'-deiodinase, leading to an accumulation of T4 and a reduction in T3.
Answer: (E) Peripheral 5'-deiodinase

Question: A 14-year-old male is brought to your psychiatric clinic after he was caught stealing his peers’ belongings multiple times by his teacher. He is a straight-A student with many friends and is an outstanding football player. He describes his family as very loving and gets along with his older siblings. He also states that he has no ill will towards anyone he stole from in class. Although never caught, he admits that he would often steal things in stores or locker rooms when no one was looking in order to satisfy an intense impulse. Which of the following is the best diagnosis for this patient? (D) Kleptomania (B) Manic episode (A) Anger towards classmates (E) Schizophrenia (C) Conduct disorder
Reason: The answer is (D) Kleptomania because the patient exhibits a recurrent urge to steal items that are not needed for personal use or monetary gain, and describes the behavior as an intense impulse he cannot control. This aligns with the diagnostic criteria for kleptomania, which is characterized by a compulsive need to steal, often accompanied by feelings of tension before the theft and gratification or relief afterward, rather than malice or anger towards others.
Answer: (D) Kleptomania

Question: A 52-year-old man presents with 2 months of diarrhea, abdominal pain, and fatigue. He reports a weight loss of 4 kg (8 lb). He also says his joints have been hurting recently, as well. Past medical history is unremarkable. Review of systems is significant for problems with concentration and memory. Physical examination is unremarkable. A GI endoscopy is performed with a biopsy of the small bowel. Which of the following histologic finding would most likely be seen in this patient? (D) Absence of nerves in the myenteric plexus (C) Non-caseating granulomas in the small intestine (A) PAS positive macrophages (E) Presence of C. trachomatis in urine specimen (B) Blunting of the villi
Reason: The answer is (A) PAS positive macrophages because these findings are indicative of a condition such as Whipple's disease, which can cause gastrointestinal symptoms, arthralgia, and cognitive difficulties, as seen in this patient. The presence of PAS positive macrophages in the intestinal biopsy is characteristic of this malabsorption disorder, which results from the accumulation of Tropheryma whipplei bacteria within macrophages, leading to the clinical manifestations described.
Answer: (A) PAS positive macrophages

Question: A 75-year-old female comes to the physician’s office with complaints of right lower quadrant pain. She has been experiencing these symptoms for the last 6 months and they have progressively gotten worse. An ultrasound reveals a large ovarian mass and abdominal and pelvic CT reveals no metastases. Her serum levels of CA-125 are elevated and the biopsy reveals the primary neoplasm as ovarian in origin. Her cancer is characterized as invasive carcinoma without metastasis. Which of the following cellular changes is consistent with this diagnosis? (D) Seeding via capillaries (A) Appropriate basal to apical differentiation (C) Loss of E-cadherin (E) Increased proliferation of cells with preservation of size and shape (B) Intact basement membrane
Reason: The answer is (C) Loss of E-cadherin. This is because E-cadherin is a cell adhesion molecule that helps maintain the structure and integrity of the epithelial tissue. Invasive carcinoma, such as the ovarian cancer described, often involves a loss of E-cadherin, which facilitates the detachment of cancer cells from the primary tumor and their invasion into surrounding tissues.
Answer: (C) Loss of E-cadherin

Question: A 4-year-old boy is brought by his mother to the emergency room for malaise, dizziness, and sleepiness. The mother owns a dry cleaning shop and found her son in the back room with an open canister of carbon tetrachloride, one of their cleaning fluids. The boy reports feeling nauseous and has a mild headache. He has a history of spastic hemiplegic cerebral palsy and is seen regularly by a pediatric neurologist. He is otherwise healthy and takes no medications. His temperature is 98.6°F (37°C), blood pressure is 105/55 mmHg, pulse is 105/min, and respirations are 22/min. On exam, he appears tired and drowsy but is able to answer questions. He has increased tone in his left upper and lower extremities. Which of the following is most likely to be affected by this patient's exposure to the dry cleaning fluid? (E) Myocardium (D) Lung parenchyma (A) Bone marrow (B) Gastric mucosa (C) Hepatocytes
Reason: The answer is (C) Hepatocytes. This is because carbon tetrachloride is known to cause hepatotoxicity, resulting in damage to the liver cells (hepatocytes) through mechanisms that include oxidative stress and fatty degeneration. Given the child's exposure and the symptoms, liver function is likely compromised, making hepatocytes particularly vulnerable to injury from this chemical.
Answer: (C) Hepatocytes

Question: An excisional biopsy is performed and the diagnosis of superficial spreading melanoma is confirmed. The lesion is 1.1 mm thick. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? (C) Surgical excision with 1-2 cm safety margins and sentinel lymph node study (B) Surgical excision with 1-2 cm safety margins only (A) Surgical excision with 0.5-1 cm safety margins only (E) Surgical excision with 1 cm safety margins only
" (D) Surgical excision with 0.5-1 cm safety margins and sentinel lymph node study
Reason: The answer is (C) Surgical excision with 1-2 cm safety margins and sentinel lymph node study. This is the recommended management for a melanoma that is greater than 1 mm in thickness, as wider margins help reduce the risk of local recurrence, and a sentinel lymph node biopsy is important for assessing potential metastatic spread, particularly in cases with a thickness above 1 mm. These steps are part of the standard protocol for managing intermediate-thickness melanomas.
Answer: (C) Surgical excision with 1-2 cm safety margins and sentinel lymph node study

Question: A 17-year-old girl comes to the emergency department because of numbness around her mouth and uncontrolled twitching of the mouth for the past 30 minutes. Her symptoms began while she was at a concert. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 69/min, and respirations are 28/min. When the blood pressure cuff is inflated, painful contractions of the hand muscles occur. Arterial blood gas shows a pH of 7.53, pO2 of 100 mm Hg, and a pCO2 of 29 mm Hg. Which of the following additional findings is most likely in this patient? (E) Increased serum phosphate concentration (D) Increased serum potassium concentration (C) Decreased total serum calcium concentration (B) Increased peripheral oxygen unloading from hemoglobin (A) Decreased cerebral blood flow
Reason: This patient presents with symptoms suggestive of hyperventilation syndrome, which can lead to respiratory alkalosis (as indicated by the arterial blood gas with a pH of 7.53 and low pCO2). Hyperventilation can cause vasoconstriction of cerebral blood vessels, potentially leading to decreased cerebral blood flow, which aligns with the reported symptoms of numbness and twitching.
Answer: (A) Decreased cerebral blood flow

Question: A 42-year-old man presents to his family physician for evaluation of oral pain. He states that he has increasing pain in a molar on the top left of his mouth. The pain started 1 week ago and has been progressively worsening since then. His medical history is significant for hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus, both of which are currently controlled with lifestyle modifications. His blood pressure is 124/86 mm Hg, heart rate is 86/min, and respiratory rate is 14/min. Physical examination is notable for a yellow-black discoloration of the second molar on his left upper mouth. The decision is made to refer him to a dentist for further management of this cavity. The patient has never had any dental procedures and is nervous about what type of sedation will be used. Which of the following forms of anesthesia utilizes solely an oral or intravenous anti-anxiety medication? (D) Dissociation (E) Regional anesthesia (B) Epidural anesthesia (C) Deep sedation (A) Minimal Sedation
Reason: To support the choice of Minimal Sedation as the type of anesthesia that utilizes solely an oral or intravenous anti-anxiety medication, one can reason that minimal sedation is designed to relieve anxiety while still allowing the patient to maintain control over their own airway and respond to verbal commands. This approach typically involves the use of sedatives that can be administered orally or intravenously without the need for more invasive techniques.
Answer: (A) Minimal Sedation

Question: A 3-year-old African-American boy presents with a rapid onset of severe abdominal pain. He has a palpably enlarged mass in the left upper quadrant of his abdomen. Complete blood count is notable for a hemoglobin of 7.2 g/dL. Serum haptoglobin level returns normal. Serum unconjugated bilirubin is elevated. The corrected reticulocyte count is elevated. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for the findings above? (C) Renal infarction (B) Acute chest syndrome (E) Extravascular hemolysis (D) Intravascular hemolysis (A) Aplastic crisis
Reason: To support the choice of Extravascular hemolysis as the most likely explanation for the findings, one can reason that the combination of anemia (as indicated by low hemoglobin), elevated levels of unconjugated bilirubin, and an elevated corrected reticulocyte count suggests that the body is producing more red blood cells in response to hemolysis. Extravascular hemolysis, commonly seen in conditions like sickle cell disease, occurs when red blood cells are destroyed by the reticuloendothelial system (especially in the spleen), leading to elevated bilirubin and anemia.
Answer: (E) Extravascular hemolysis

Question: A 38-year-old G2P2 presents to her gynecologist to discuss the results of her diagnostic tests. She has no  current complaints or concurrent diseases. She underwent a tubal ligation after her last pregnancy. Her last Pap smear showed a high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion and a reflex HPV test was positive. Colposcopic examination reveals areas of thin acetowhite epithelium with diffuse borders and fine punctation. The biopsy obtained from the suspicious areas shows CIN 1. Which of the following is an appropriate next step in the management of this patient? (C) Cold-knife conization (D) Test for type 16 and 18 HPV (A) Cryoablation (B) Loop electrosurgical excision procedure (E) Repeat cytology and HPV co-testing in 6 months
Reason: The appropriate next step in managing this patient, who has a history of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) with positive HPV, would be a Loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP). This procedure allows for both diagnosis and treatment by excising the affected cervical tissue to remove potentially precancerous lesions. Given the findings of CIN 1 on biopsy and her previous HSIL, LEEP is indicated to ensure complete removal of abnormal cells, as she has a significant risk of progression to a higher-grade lesion due to the persistent HPV positivity.

Question: A 42-year-old woman, gravida 3, para 3 comes to the physician because of a 14-month history of prolonged and heavy menstrual bleeding. Menses occur at regular 28-day intervals and last 7 days with heavy flow. She also feels fatigued. She is sexually active with her husband and does not use contraception. Vital signs are within normal limits. Pelvic examination shows a firm, irregularly-shaped uterus consistent in size with a 16-week gestation. Her hemoglobin concentration is 9 g/dL, hematocrit is 30%, and mean corpuscular volume is 92 μm3. Pelvic ultrasound shows multiple intramural masses in an irregularly enlarged uterus. The ovaries appear normal bilaterally. The patient has completed childbearing and would like definitive treatment for her symptoms. Operative treatment is scheduled. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? (E) Estrogen-progestin contraceptive pills (C) Levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device (A) Progestin-only contraceptive pills (D) Tranexamic acid (B) Leuprolide
Reason: In this case, the most appropriate next step in management is using leuprolide, which is a GnRH agonist that can help shrink uterine fibroids effectively before surgery. Leuprolide can reduce fibroid size and alleviate symptoms such as heavy bleeding and pain, making the surgical procedure more manageable and potentially improving outcomes for the patient. Additionally, since she has completed childbearing and is seeking definitive treatment, leuprolide provides a temporary solution while preparing for the surgical intervention.

[INFO] Sampling path 10 completed.
[INFO] Opinion paths:
Path 1: Let's think through the details of the question. 

The patient is a 17-year-old woman with a history of missed menstrual periods (amenorrhea) and signs that suggest she may be suffering from bulimia nervosa, such as binge eating, enlarged cheeks (likely due to parotid gland enlargement), and calluses on the hands (from self-induced vomiting). 

In bulimia nervosa, one common dental finding is erosion of tooth enamel due to the repeated exposure to gastric acid from vomiting. 

Now, let's analyze the options:
- (D) Enlarged thyroid: This is not a typical finding associated with bulimia.
- (A) Malar rash: This is associated with lupus and not bulimia.
- (B) Increased blood glucose level: This is not characteristic of bulimia.
- (E) Elevated estrogen levels: This is not a direct consequence of bulimia.
- (C) Erosion of tooth enamel: This is a well-known consequence of repeated vomiting in bulimia.

Given these considerations, the most expected finding in this patient is:

**Answer: (C) Erosion of tooth enamel**
Path 2: Let's evaluate the details provided in the question step by step:

- The patient is a 17-year-old woman who has not had her menstrual period for 4 months, has a history of regular menstrual cycles, and denies sexual activity. 
- She has a negative urine pregnancy test, which rules out pregnancy as a cause of amenorrhea.
- She appears well-nourished with a BMI of 21 kg/m², indicating she is within a normal weight range.
- The examination reveals enlarged cheeks bilaterally (which can suggest a condition like Cushing's syndrome or effects of binge eating), and calluses on the dorsum of her hands, which are suggestive of repeated trauma or friction, commonly seen in patients who engage in binge eating behaviors (known as "Russell's sign").
- She has been under stress and has recently been binge eating.

Given these findings, the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings suggest that she may be experiencing complications related to binge eating disorder, particularly effects on her oral health.

One expected finding in patients who binge eat, particularly with self-induced vomiting (which is common in eating disorders), is erosion of tooth enamel due to exposure to stomach acid.

Therefore, the answer to the question is:
(C) Erosion of tooth enamel.
Path 3: Let's think step by step. The clinical presentation of the 17-year-old woman suggests that she may have bulimia nervosa, characterized by binge eating and potentially purging behaviors, which can lead to various physical findings.

1. **Enlarged cheeks** - This could indicate parotid gland enlargement, which is common in individuals with bulimia due to repeated vomiting or binge eating.
   
2. **Calluses on the dorsum of hands** - This is a sign of "Russell's sign," which occurs from self-induced vomiting.

3. **Menstrual irregularity** - This can be due to stress or the effects of eating disorders on hormonal levels.

Among the answer options provided, the most likely additional finding in a patient with bulimia nervosa would be:

**(C) Erosion of tooth enamel** - This is due to the exposure of teeth to gastric acid from vomiting, leading to dental erosion.

Thus, the correct answer is: **(C) Erosion of tooth enamel.**
Path 4: Let's analyze the information step by step. The patient is a 17-year-old woman with a history of amenorrhea (absence of menstrual periods) for 4 months, enlarged cheeks (which could indicate facial swelling or a "moon face"), and calluses on the dorsum of her hands, suggesting possible self-induced vomiting (associated with bulimia nervosa). She also reports binge eating and significant stress related to school.

Given these symptoms, the most likely diagnosis is bulimia nervosa. One common consequence of bulimia nervosa is dental erosion due to repeated exposure to stomach acid from vomiting. Thus, erosion of tooth enamel would be a typical finding to expect in a patient with bulimia nervosa.

Answer: (C) Erosion of tooth enamel.
Path 5: Let's analyze the scenario step by step.

The patient is a 17-year-old woman presenting with secondary amenorrhea for 4 months, enlarged cheeks, and calluses on the dorsum of her hands. Given her history of binge eating and the physical findings, this suggests a diagnosis consistent with bulimia nervosa. 

In bulimia nervosa, particularly due to the binge eating followed by compensatory behaviors (which could be inferred even if not explicitly mentioned), one of the common findings is erosion of tooth enamel due to repeated exposure to gastric acid from vomiting.

Now, looking at the options provided:

- (D) Enlarged thyroid: This is not a typical finding in bulimia.
- (A) Malar rash: This is more indicative of lupus or other autoimmune disorders, not bulimia.
- (B) Increased blood glucose level: This is not directly related to bulimia nervosa.
- (E) Elevated estrogen levels: These levels would not be elevated in the context of amenorrhea due to bulimia.
- (C) Erosion of tooth enamel: This is a common finding in patients with bulimia due to the effects of gastric acid from vomiting.

Based on this analysis, the best answer is:

**Answer: (C) Erosion of tooth enamel**.
Path 6: Let's analyze the information step by step.

The patient is a 17-year-old woman who has experienced amenorrhea (absence of menstruation) for 4 months, has enlarged cheeks (suggestive of possible chubby appearance), and calluses on the dorsum of her hands, which suggests that she may be engaging in behaviors associated with bulimia nervosa, particularly binge eating followed by compensatory behaviors (like inducing vomiting). 

In bulimia nervosa, frequent vomiting can lead to various complications, one of which is dental erosion due to the acidic nature of gastric contents. The calluses on the hands may also indicate she uses her hands to induce vomiting (Russell's sign).

Given these considerations, the most likely additional finding we would expect in this patient is:

(C) Erosion of tooth enamel.

This finding is common in individuals with bulimia nervosa due to repeated exposure of the teeth to stomach acid.

Answer: (C) Erosion of tooth enamel.
Path 7: Let's analyze the case step by step. The patient is a 17-year-old woman who has not had her menstrual period for 4 months, has enlarged cheeks (suggestive of possible parotid gland enlargement), and calluses on the dorsum of her hands. She reports binge eating and significant stress, which raises suspicion for bulimia nervosa, an eating disorder characterized by episodes of binge eating followed by compensatory behaviors (such as vomiting or excessive exercise).

In bulimia nervosa, one common finding is erosion of tooth enamel due to the exposure of teeth to gastric acid from vomiting. Since the patient has calluses on her hands, it may also indicate self-induced vomiting (a behavior often seen in bulimia). 

Based on this reasoning, the expected finding in this patient would be:

Answer: (C) Erosion of tooth enamel.
Path 8: Let's analyze the scenario step by step. The patient is a 17-year-old woman with amenorrhea (absence of menstruation), bilateral enlarged cheeks (which could indicate facial swelling), and calluses on her hands. The history of binge eating and the calluses suggest possible self-induced vomiting, which is often associated with bulimia nervosa. 

In bulimia nervosa, one of the common physical findings is erosion of tooth enamel due to the gastric acid from vomiting. This erosion can lead to increased sensitivity and a higher risk of cavities. 

Considering this information, the most likely additional finding in this patient would be:

Answer: (C) Erosion of tooth enamel.
Path 9: Let's analyze the information step by step.

1. **Patient Background**: The patient is a 17-year-old woman who has experienced amenorrhea (absence of menstruation) for 4 months. She has a history of regular menstrual cycles until recently, denies sexual activity, and has a negative pregnancy test.

2. **Physical Examination Findings**: The patient has enlarged cheeks bilaterally (which could indicate facial swelling or a condition like Cushing's syndrome) and calluses on the dorsum of her hands (often seen in individuals who induce vomiting or have frequent contact with surfaces, possibly indicating self-induced vomiting).

3. **Behavioral Symptoms**: The patient reports binge eating and stress related to school, which suggests possible eating disorders, specifically bulimia nervosa.

4. **Expected Findings**: In cases of bulimia nervosa, one common physical finding is erosion of tooth enamel due to repeated exposure to gastric acid from vomiting. This is because the acid can wear away the enamel of the teeth.

Given the connection between her behavioral symptoms, physical examination findings, and the diagnosis of bulimia nervosa, the most expected finding in this patient would be:

**Answer: (C) Erosion of tooth enamel**.
Path 10: Let's analyze the details of the case step by step.

The 17-year-old woman presents with amenorrhea (absence of menstruation) for 4 months, has a history of binge eating, and shows signs such as enlarged cheeks (which could suggest parotid gland enlargement) and calluses on the dorsum of her hands (which could indicate self-induced vomiting or "Russell's sign" commonly associated with bulimia nervosa).

Given her symptoms and the fact that she has been binge eating, we can suspect that she may have bulimia nervosa. In bulimia nervosa, repeated episodes of binge eating often lead to purging behaviors such as vomiting, which can result in dental erosion due to the exposure of teeth to stomach acid.

Thus, the expected finding in this patient, in line with bulimia nervosa, would be:

**Answer: (C) Erosion of tooth enamel**. 

This aligns with the typical dental findings seen in patients with bulimia nervosa.
[INFO] Final decision by majority voting
After reviewing the 10 different reasoning paths and their corresponding answers, it is clear that all paths consistently identify the expected finding in the patient as:

**(C) Erosion of tooth enamel.**

Each path provides a logical analysis of the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, leading to the conclusion that erosion of tooth enamel is a common consequence of bulimia nervosa due to repeated exposure to gastric acid from vomiting.

Since all paths unanimously agree on this answer, the final decision is:

**Final Decision: (C) Erosion of tooth enamel.**

Question: A 72-year-old woman presents to the clinic complaining of diarrhea for the past week. She mentions intense fatigue and intermittent, cramping abdominal pain. She has not noticed any blood in her stool. She recalls an episode of pneumonia last month for which she was hospitalized and treated with antibiotics. She has traveled recently to Florida to visit her family and friends. Her past medical history is significant for hypertension, peptic ulcer disease, and hypercholesterolemia for which she takes losartan, esomeprazole, and atorvastatin. She also has osteoporosis, for which she takes calcium and vitamin D and occasional constipation for which she takes an over the counter laxative as needed. Physical examination shows lower abdominal tenderness but is otherwise insignificant. Blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg, pulse is 80/min, and respiratory rate is 18/min. Stool testing is performed and reveals the presence of anaerobic, gram-positive bacilli. Which of the following increased this patient’s risk of developing this clinical presentation? (E) Osteoporosis treated with calcium and vitamin D (C) Peptic ulcer disease treated with esomeprazole (A) Recent travel to Florida (D) Hypercholesterolemia treated with atorvastatin (B) Constipation treated with laxatives
Reason: The answer is (C) Peptic ulcer disease treated with esomeprazole. The use of proton pump inhibitors like esomeprazole can disrupt the normal gastric environment and may lead to an overgrowth of bacteria, such as Clostridium difficile, especially after antibiotic treatment. This bacterial overgrowth can result in diarrhea, abdominal pain, and subsequent symptoms observed in this patient.
Answer: (C) Peptic ulcer disease treated with esomeprazole

Question: A 7-year-old boy presents to your office with facial eczema. He has a history of recurrent infections, including multiple episodes of pneumonia that lasted several weeks and otitis media. Laboratory measurements of serum immunoglobulins show increased IgE and IgA but decreased IgM. Which of the following additional abnormalities would you expect to observe in this patient? (E) NADPH oxidase deficiency (B) Leukopenia (A) Thrombocytopenia (C) Anemia (D) Pancreatic insufficiency
Reason: The answer is (A) Thrombocytopenia. Given this child's history of eczema, recurrent infections, and the specific immunoglobulin abnormalities (increased IgE and IgA with decreased IgM), these findings are suggestive of Hyper-IgE syndrome (Job syndrome). In this condition, thrombocytopenia can occur as part of the associated hematologic abnormalities, making it a reasonable expectation alongside the immunodeficiency symptoms presented.
Answer: (A) Thrombocytopenia

Question: A 51-year-old man is admitted to the hospital because of a 2-day history of fever, nausea, and abdominal pain. His temperature is 39.4°C (102.9°F) and pulse is 106/min. Physical examination shows tenderness in the right upper quadrant. Blood cultures grow nonhemolytic, gram-positive cocci that grow in hypertonic saline. Antibiotic sensitivity testing of the isolated organism shows that gentamicin has a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 16 μg/mL. The addition of ampicillin, which has an MIC of 2 μg/mL alone, decreases the MIC of gentamicin to 0.85 μg/mL. The decrease in the MIC of gentamicin with the addition of ampicillin is most likely due to which of the following mechanisms? (D) Inhibition of the acetylation of gentamicin (E) Sequential block of essential micronutrient synthesis (B) Increase in the intracellular uptake of gentamicin (C) Stabilization of gentamicin binding at the target site (A) Additive bacteriostatic effect of ampicillin
Reason: The answer is (B) Increase in the intracellular uptake of gentamicin because the presence of ampicillin can disrupt the bacterial cell wall, enhancing the permeability of the bacterial cell membrane. This allows for improved uptake of gentamicin, which is an aminoglycoside antibiotic that relies on efficient entry into the bacterial cell for its activity against gram-positive organisms.
Answer: (B) Increase in the intracellular uptake of gentamicin

Question: A 51-year-old woman presents for her annual wellness visit. She says she feels healthy and has no specific concerns. Past medical history is significant for bipolar disorder, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus type 2, managed with lithium, lisinopril, and metformin, respectively. Her family history is significant for hypertension and diabetes mellitus type 2 in her father, who died from lung cancer at age 67. Her vital signs include: temperature 36.8°C (98.2°F), pulse 97/min, respiratory rate 16/min, blood pressure 120/75 mm Hg. Physical examination is unremarkable. Mammogram findings are labeled breast imaging reporting and data system-3 (BIRADS-3) (probably benign). Which of the following is the next best step in management in this patient? (A) Follow-up mammogram in 1 year (D) Biopsy (E) Treatment (C) Breast MRI (B) Follow-up mammogram in 6 months
Reason: The answer is (B) Follow-up mammogram in 6 months because a BIRADS-3 designation indicates that the findings are probably benign, but additional imaging within a shorter time frame is recommended to ensure that there are no changes that might indicate a need for further investigation. This follow-up approach balances careful monitoring while minimizing unnecessary interventions.
Answer: (B) Follow-up mammogram in 6 months

Question: A 2-month-old boy is brought to the emergency department 25 minutes after having a seizure. He has had multiple seizures during the past week. His mother has noticed that he has become lethargic and has had a weak cry for the past month. He was born at 37 weeks' gestation. He is at the 20th percentile for height and 15th percentile for weight. His temperature is 36.7°C (98°F), respirations are 50/min, and pulse is 140/min. Examination shows a soft and nontender abdomen. The liver is palpated 4 cm below the right costal margin; there is no splenomegaly. Serum studies show:
Na+ 137 mEq/L
Cl- 103 mEq/L
K+ 3.9 mEq/L
Glucose 32 mg/dL
Calcium 9.6 mg/dL
Total cholesterol 202 mg/dL
Triglycerides 260 mg/dL

A deficiency of which of the following enzymes is the most likely cause of this infant's symptoms?" (B) Galactose 1-phosphate uridyltransferase (A) Glycogen branching enzyme (C) Fructokinase (E) Acid maltase
" (D) Glucose 6-phosphatase
Reason: The answer is (D) Glucose 6-phosphatase because the infant's hypoglycemia (low blood glucose level) and lactic acidosis, along with hepatomegaly (enlarged liver), are indicative of a glycogen storage disease, specifically Von Gierke disease, which is caused by a deficiency in glucose 6-phosphatase. This enzyme's deficiency leads to the inability to convert glycogen to glucose, resulting in the accumulation of glycogen in the liver and consequent metabolic disturbances, including seizures from hypoglycemia.
Answer: (D) Glucose 6-phosphatase

Question: A 27-year-old man presents to the emergency department with general weakness and fatigue. He states that he has not felt well for several days and can't take care of himself anymore due to fatigue. The patient has a past medical history of IV drug abuse, alcohol abuse, and multiple minor traumas associated with intoxication. His temperature is 104°F (40°C), blood pressure is 127/68 mmHg, pulse is 120/min, respirations are 19/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. A murmur is heard on cardiac exam. The patient is treated appropriately and transferred to the inpatient floor and recovers over the next several days. The patient has been unable to eat solids, though he has been drinking large amounts of juice. On day 5 of his stay, the patient states he feels much better. He is no longer febrile. His only concern is profuse and watery diarrhea and severe abdominal pain which he has been experiencing since yesterday. The patient is started on IV fluids and given oral fluid replacement as well. Which of the following is associated with the most likely underlying diagnosis? (B) Ascitic fluid infection (A) Anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody positivity (ASCA) (E) Schistocytes on peripheral smear (C) Pseudomembranes of fibrin (D) Increased osmotic load
Reason: The patient's clinical presentation, including recent antibiotic treatment for an infection, severe diarrhea, and abdominal pain, suggests a diagnosis of Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). The formation of pseudomembranes in the colon, which consist of fibrin, dead cells, and inflammatory cells, is characteristic of CDI and is often seen on endoscopic examination or biopsy in affected patients.

Question: A 48-year-old male presents to his primary care provider with a two-week history of low back pain and left leg pain. He reports that his symptoms started while he was working at his job as a construction worker. He has since experienced intermittent achy pain over his lumbar spine. He has also noticed pain radiating into his left leg and weakness in left ankle dorsiflexion. On exam, he demonstrates the following findings on strength testing of the left leg: 5/5 in knee extension, 4/5 in ankle dorsiflexion, 4/5 in great toe extension, 5/5 in ankle plantarflexion, and 5/5 in great toe flexion. The patellar reflexes are 5/5 bilaterally. He is able to toe walk but has difficulty with heel walking. Weakness in which of the following compartments of the leg is most likely causing this patient’s foot drop? (E) Medial compartment (C) Anterior compartment (D) Lateral compartment (A) Superficial posterior compartment (B) Deep posterior compartment
Reason: The answer is (C) Anterior compartment because the symptoms of weakness in ankle dorsiflexion, as indicated by a strength rating of 4/5 in that area, suggest dysfunction of the muscles responsible for lifting the foot, primarily the tibialis anterior, which is located in the anterior compartment of the leg. This weakness results in foot drop, a condition where the patient struggles to lift the front of the foot, leading to difficulty in heel walking as noted in the evaluation.
Answer: (C) Anterior compartment

Question: A 5-year-old boy presents to the pediatrician for a well child visit. He is meeting his developmental milestones and is in the 15th percentile for height and 70th percentile for weight. His parents report that he complains of fatiguing easily and having trouble participating in sports. They are concerned he is not getting enough sleep and state that sometimes they hear him snore. The patient has a past medical history of a supracondylar fracture of the humerus, which was appropriately treated. He is doing well in school but is sometimes bullied for being small. The patient eats a balanced diet of milk, fruit, and some vegetables. His parents have been trying to get him to drink more milk so he can grow taller. His temperature is 99.5°F (37.5°C), blood pressure is 90/48 mmHg, pulse is 100/min, respirations are 19/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. On physical exam, the patient appears well. HEENT exam is notable for conjunctival pallor and a unilateral clear middle ear effusion. Cardiac exam reveals a benign flow murmur. Pulmonary exam is clear to auscultation bilaterally. The patient's gait is stable and he is able to jump up and down. A full set of labs are ordered as requested by the parents including a serum vitamin D level, B12 level, and IGF level. A selection of these lab values are seen below.

Serum:
Na+: 139 mEq/L
Cl-: 100 mEq/L
K+: 4.3 mEq/L
HCO3-: 25 mEq/L
BUN: 20 mg/dL
Glucose: 99 mg/dL
Creatinine: 1.1 mg/dL
Ca2+: 9.9 mg/dL
AST: 12 U/L
ALT: 10 U/L

Which of the following would you expect to find in this patient? (D) Increased RDW and TIBC (C) Decreased vitamin D level (A) Decreased IGF levels (B) Decreased oxygen saturation when the patient sleeps (E) Increased MCV
Reason: The most likely findings in this patient would be increased RDW (Red Cell Distribution Width) and TIBC (Total Iron Binding Capacity) due to his conjunctival pallor, which suggests a possible iron deficiency anemia. These lab values can reflect the body's response to anemia; increased RDW indicates greater variability in red blood cell size, commonly seen in iron deficiency, and increased TIBC corresponds to the body's attempt to transport more iron in response to low iron stores.
Answer: (D) Increased RDW and TIBC

Question: You would like to conduct a study investigating potential risk factors that predispose patients to develop cirrhosis. Using a registry of admitted patients over the last 10 years at your local hospital, you isolate all patients who have been diagnosed with cirrhosis. Subsequently, you contact this group of patients, asking them to complete a survey assessing their prior exposure to alcohol use, intravenous drug abuse, blood transfusions, personal history of cancer, and other medical comorbidities. An identical survey is given to an equal number of patients in the registry who do not carry a prior diagnosis of cirrhosis. Which of the following best describes the type of study you are attempting to conduct? (A) Cohort study (C) Case-control study (B) Meta-analysis (D) Cross-sectional study (E) Randomized controlled trial
Reason: Reasoning: In this scenario, you are comparing a group of patients with a specific outcome (cirrhosis) to a group without that outcome. Since the study examines prior exposures in the past to identify potential risk factors, it aligns with the definition of a case-control study, where cases (patients with the condition) are compared to controls (patients without the condition) based on their past experiences or exposures.

Question: A 54-year-old gardener with diabetes mellitus from the Northeast Jillin Province in China acquired a small scratch from a thorn while working in his flower garden. After 3 weeks, he noticed a small pink, painless bump at the site of a scratch. He was not concerned by the bump; however, additional linearly-distributed bumps that resembled boils began to appear 1 week later that were quite painful. When the changes took on the appearance of open sores that drained clear fluid without any evidence of healing (as shown on the image), he finally visited his physician. The physician referred to the gardener for a skin biopsy to confirm his working diagnosis and to start treatment as soon as possible. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis for this patient? (C) Cat scratch disease (D) Leishmaniasis (E) Sporotrichosis (A) Paracoccidioidomycosis (B) Blastomycosis
Reason: Reasoning: The patient's presentation of a small painless bump at the site of a scratch, followed by the development of painful, linearly-distributed bumps that resemble boils and eventually form open sores, is characteristic of sporotrichosis. This fungal infection is often associated with gardening activities and can occur after skin trauma, leading to cutaneous manifestations that progress in this manner.

Question: A 55-year-old man presents to the emergency department for chest pain. He states that the pain started last night and has persisted until this morning. He describes the pain as in his chest and radiating into his back between his scapulae. The patient has a past medical history of alcohol abuse and cocaine abuse. He recently returned from vacation on a transatlantic flight. The patient has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes per day for the past 20 years. His temperature is 99.5°F (37.5°C), blood pressure is 167/118 mmHg, pulse is 120/min, and respirations are 22/min. Physical exam reveals tachycardia and clear air movement bilaterally on cardiopulmonary exam. Which of the following is also likely to be found in this patient? (B) Coronary artery thrombus (D) Elevated lipase (C) Coronary artery vasospasm (A) Asymmetric blood pressures in the upper extremities (E) Pulmonary artery thrombus
Reason: Reasoning: The patient’s presentation of chest pain that radiates to the back, along with his history of cocaine use, raises suspicion for aortic dissection, which can lead to asymmetric blood pressures in the upper extremities due to differential blood flow past the dissection site. In aortic dissection, the dissection can extend and compromise blood flow to one arm or the other, resulting in a significant difference in blood pressure readings between the arms.
Answer: (A) Asymmetric blood pressures in the upper extremities

Question: A 14-year-old teenager is brought to the physician by her mother who seems extremely concerned that her daughter is unable to sleep at night and has become increasingly irritated and aggressive. She has been noticing changes in her daughter’s behavior recently. She had no idea what was going on until she found pills hidden in her daughter’s room a week ago. Her daughter confessed that she tried these drugs once with her friends and started using them since then. Her mother threw away all the pills and prevented her daughter from seeing her friends. This is when she started to notice her tear often and sweat. She is seeking a quick and effective treatment for her daughter. Which drug was the teenager most likely using? (E) Cocaine (A) Atomoxetine (C) Naloxone (D) Marijuana (B) Oxycodone
Reason: The teenager's symptoms, such as irritability, aggression, sweating, and tearing after her mother disposed of the pills, suggest withdrawal signs commonly associated with opioid use, particularly oxycodone. These symptoms align with the known effects of opioid dependency, making oxycodone the most likely substance the teenager was using.

Question: A 46-year-old premenopausal woman undergoes lumpectomy after a diagnosis of invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast is made. Pathologic examination of the surgical specimen shows that the breast cancer cells stain positive for estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor, and negative for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2. Which of the following characteristics applies to the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient's condition? (D) Monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor (A) Selective agonist at estrogen receptors in bone tissue (E) Selective antagonist at estrogen receptors in endometrium
" (C) Monoclonal antibody against tyrosine kinase receptor (B) Selective agonist at progesterone receptors in mammary tissue
Reason: The patient's breast cancer is hormone receptor-positive, meaning it relies on estrogen for growth. In premenopausal women with this type of breast cancer, treatments often involve the use of selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) or aromatase inhibitors to block the effects of estrogen; however, since the question specifically asks for a characteristic of the pharmacotherapy, a selective agonist at estrogen receptors in bone tissue suggests that the drug may help mitigate bone density loss, which is important for women on anti-estrogen therapy.

Question: A 34-year-old man presents to the emergency department by ambulance after being involved in a fight. On arrival, there is obvious trauma to his face and neck, and his mouth is full of blood. Seconds after suctioning the blood, his mouth rapidly fills up with blood again. As a result, he is unable to speak to you. An attempt at direct laryngoscopy fails as a result of his injuries. His vital signs are pulse 102/min, blood pressure 110/75 mmHg, and O2 saturation 97%. Which of the following is indicated at this time? (B) Cricothyroidotomy (E) Cardiopulmonary resusication (C) Nasogastric tube (D) Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) (A) Endotracheal intubation
Reason: Given the severe trauma to the man's face and neck, direct laryngoscopy is indicated as unsuccessful for airway management. Since he is unable to maintain his airway due to blood filling his mouth repeatedly, performing a cricothyroidotomy is warranted as it provides a surgical airway that bypasses the obstructed route, allowing ventilatory support in an emergency setting.

Question: A 30-year-old woman comes to the physician because of increased urinary frequency over the past month. She also reports having dry mouth and feeling thirsty all the time despite drinking several liters of water per day. She has not had any weight changes and her appetite is normal. She has a history of obsessive compulsive disorder treated with citalopram. She drinks 1–2 cans of beer per day. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show:
Serum
Na+ 130 mEq/L
Glucose 110 mg/dL
Osmolality 265 mOsmol/kg
Urine
Osmolality 230 mOsmol/kg
The patient is asked to stop drinking water for 3 hours. Following water restriction, urine osmolality is measured every hour, whereas serum osmolality is measured every 2 hours. Repeated laboratory measurements show a serum osmolality of 280 mOsmol/kg and a urine osmolality of 650 mOsmol/kg. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?" (E) Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (A) Cerebral salt wasting (D) Primary polydipsia (B) Central diabetes insipidus (C) Diabetes mellitus
Reason: The symptoms and laboratory findings suggest primary polydipsia as the most likely diagnosis. In this case, the patient exhibits increased thirst and urinary frequency, typical of polydipsia, and the water restriction test shows significant urine concentration (650 mOsmol/kg) indicating the kidneys can concentrate urine effectively when excess water intake is limited. The lower baseline urine osmolality (230 mOsmol/kg) prior to restriction suggests an inability to concentrate urine due to excess water intake, characteristic of primary polydipsia rather than other conditions such as diabetes insipidus, which would show persistently low urine osmolality despite water restriction.

Question: A previously healthy 23-year-old African-American man comes to the physician because of a painless swelling on the left side of his jaw for 2 months. It has been progressively increasing in size and is draining thick, foul-smelling fluid. He does not have fever or weight loss. He had a molar extracted around 3 months ago. One year ago, he developed a generalized rash after receiving amoxicillin for streptococcal pharyngitis; the rash was managed with oral steroids. There is no family history of serious illness. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows a 4-cm, tender, erythematous mass in the left submandibular region that has a sinus draining purulent material at its lower border. Submandibular lymphadenopathy is present. His hemoglobin is 14.5 g/dL, leukocyte count is 12,300/mm3, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate is 45 mm/h. A Gram stain of the purulent material shows gram-positive filamentous rods. Which of the following is the next best step in management? (D) Penicillin V (C) Trimethoprim-sulfamethaxazole (B) Doxycycline (E) Cephalexin
" (A) Surgical resection of the mass
Reason: The presence of a painless swelling in the jaw, along with the draining of thick, foul-smelling fluid and the identification of gram-positive filamentous rods, suggests a possible actinomycosis infection, which is often associated with prior dental procedures. Doxycycline is effective against the bacteria typically responsible for actinomycosis, making it the most appropriate next step in management for this patient's condition.

Question: An 8-year-old girl presents to the psychiatrist to discuss the recent divorce of her parents. The girl explains that her mother is the most caring and loving mother anyone could ever have and that she will be spending the majority of her time with her mother. On the other hand, she exclaims that her father is an evil person and hates him. Which of the following ego defenses is best demonstrated by this girl? (C) Projection (D) Regression (E) Splitting (A) Acting out (B) Denial
Reason: The girl's stark contrast in feelings toward her parents—viewing her mother as all-good and her father as all-bad—demonstrates the defense mechanism known as splitting. This occurs when an individual is unable to integrate positive and negative aspects of themselves or others, leading to polarized perceptions, which is typical in children grappling with complex emotions regarding family dynamics, particularly after a divorce.

A fecal occult blood test is pending. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition?" (E) Drug-induced bone marrow failure (D) Malignant plasma cell replication (C) Deficient vitamin B12 intake (B) Chronic occult blood loss (A) Decreased erythropoietin production
Reason: The most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition is decreased erythropoietin production (A). This is suggested by her anemia (low hemoglobin and reticulocyte count), renal impairment (elevated creatinine), and the history of type 1 diabetes, which can lead to renal dysfunction and consequently reduced erythropoietin synthesis, resulting in anemia of chronic disease.
Answer: (A) Decreased erythropoietin production

Question: A 63-year-old African American man presents to the emergency department with edema over his face and difficulty breathing. Past medical history is significant for hypertension and dyslipidemia. He recently began lisinopril and atorvastatin several weeks ago. His father died at 80 years from complications of a stroke and his mother lives in a nursing home. His blood pressure is 135/92 mm Hg, the heart rate is 101/min, the respiratory rate is 21/min, the temperature is 32.0°C (98.6°F). Clinical pathology results suggest a normal C1 esterase inhibitor level. Of the following options, which is the most likely diagnosis? (E) Contact dermatitis (D) Drug-induced angioedema (C) Facial lymphedema (B) Erysipelas (A) Scleredema
Reason: The most likely diagnosis for this patient is drug-induced angioedema (D). This conclusion is supported by the presentation of facial edema and difficulty breathing shortly after starting lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor known to cause angioedema in some patients, particularly in African American individuals who may have an increased risk of this side effect. Additionally, the absence of a normal C1 esterase inhibitor level makes hereditary angioedema less likely.
Answer: (D) Drug-induced angioedema

Question: A 60-year-old woman presents with progressive difficulty swallowing solid foods for the past 2 months. She also says her voice has gradually changed, and she has had recent episodes of vertigo associated with nausea and vomiting and oscillating eye movements while reading. She denies any problems with the movement of her face or extremities. Past medical history is significant for hypertension, managed with enalapril, and dyslipidemia, which she is managing with dietary modifications. The patient reports a 40-pack-year smoking history. Vital signs are within normal limits. On physical examination, there is decreased pain and temperature sensation on the right side of her body, and she cannot touch her nose with her eyes closed. Which of the following is the most likely site of vascular occlusion in this patient? (D) Anterior inferior cerebellar artery (E) Posterior inferior cerebellar artery (A) Anterior spinal artery (C) Middle cerebral artery (B) Anterior cerebral artery
Reason: The most likely site of vascular occlusion in this patient is the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (E). This conclusion is drawn from the combination of her symptoms, including dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), vertigo, oscillating eye movements, and decreased pain and temperature sensation on one side of her body, which suggests a brainstem involvement typical of lateral medullary syndrome (Wallenberg syndrome). This syndrome is often associated with occlusion of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery, which supplies the lateral medulla where these functions and symptoms are coordinated.
Answer: (E) Posterior inferior cerebellar artery

Question: A 24-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 30 minutes after being involved in a high-speed motor vehicle collision in which he was a restrained driver. On arrival, he is alert and oriented. His pulse is 112/min, respirations are 29/min, and blood pressure is 100/60 mm Hg. The pupils are equal and reactive to light. There is a 3-cm laceration over the forehead and multiple bruises over the trunk. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. The abdomen is soft and nontender. The right knee is swollen and tender; range of motion is limited by pain. Infusion of 0.9% saline is begun and intravenous acetaminophen is administered. Two hours later, blood-tinged fluid spontaneously drains from both nostrils, and is made worse by leaning forward. On a piece of gauze, it shows up as a rapidly-expanding clear ring of fluid surrounding blood. Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following? (C) Numbness of upper cheek area (E) Retroauricular ecchymosis
" (B) Bilateral periorbital ecchymosis (D) Carotid artery dissection (A) Cranial nerve XII palsy
Reason: The presence of blood-tinged fluid draining from the nostrils, combined with the mechanism of injury and physical examination findings, is suggestive of a skull base fracture, which may present with signs of periorbital ecchymosis (also known as "raccoon eyes"). This specific bruising occurs due to the pooling of blood from fractures that allow for blood to track into the orbit, supporting the likelihood of bilateral periorbital ecchymosis in this patient.
Answer: (B) Bilateral periorbital ecchymosis

Question: A 2-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of progressive headaches, dizziness, and recurrent episodes of vomiting for 3 weeks. He has a history of surgical removal of a sac-like protuberance on his lower back soon after birth. Neurologic examination shows ataxia. Fundoscopy shows bilateral optic disk swelling. An MRI of the brain is shown. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? (D) Vestibular schwannoma (C) Dandy-Walker malformation (B) Ependymoma (A) Chiari II malformation (E) Medulloblastoma
Reason: The clinical presentation of the 2-year-old boy, including progressive headaches, dizziness, vomiting, ataxia, and bilateral optic disk swelling, suggests increased intracranial pressure and possible structural brain abnormalities. Additionally, the history of a sac-like protuberance on his lower back indicates a possible connection to neural tube defects, which are often associated with Chiari II malformation, making it the most likely diagnosis in this case.
Answer: (A) Chiari II malformation

Question: A 65-year-old man comes to the physician because of double vision that began this morning. He has hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He has smoked two packs of cigarettes daily for 40 years. His current medications include lisinopril, metformin, and insulin. Physical examination shows the right eye is abducted and depressed with slight intorsion. Visual acuity is 20/20 in both eyes. Extraocular movements of the left eye are normal. Serum studies show a hemoglobin A1c of 11.5%. Which of the following additional findings is most likely in this patient? (E) Absent direct light reaction on the right eye (A) Absent consensual light reaction on the right eye (B) Loss of the right nasolabial fold (C) Upper eyelid droop on the right eye (D) Loss of smell
Reason: The findings of double vision with the right eye being abducted and depressed suggest involvement of the right cranial nerve III (oculomotor nerve), which controls multiple eye movements and also innervates levator palpebrae superioris, the muscle responsible for lifting the eyelid. This would likely lead to an upper eyelid droop (ptosis) on the affected side, making choice (C) the most likely additional finding in this patient.
Answer: (C) Upper eyelid droop on the right eye
[INFO] Sampling path 10 completed.
[INFO] Opinion paths:
Path 1: To analyze the situation step by step, we need to consider the guidelines set by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) regarding resident work hours and moonlighting.

1. **Current Work Hours**: The resident is currently working 60 hours per week in his residency program, which is already close to the maximum allowed hours for residents (typically 80 hours per week is the upper limit, including moonlighting).

2. **Moonlighting**: The resident is already working an additional 10-hour shift on Saturdays. This brings his total to 70 hours for that week.

3. **ACGME Guidelines**: The ACGME emphasizes the importance of patient safety and resident wellbeing. They set limits on how many hours a resident can work, including moonlighting.

4. **Free Time**: The resident has Sundays free and is considering working additional hours on that day. 

Now, evaluating the options:

- **(C) He may work longer shifts**: This is not necessarily true if it leads to exceeding the maximum allowed hours.
- **(A) He is already overcommitting and must reduce the number of hours**: He is not necessarily overcommitting if he is within the limit.
- **(D) He may work more hours on Sundays**: This could be possible, but he needs to be cautious about exceeding the 80 hours per week maximum.
- **(B) He is not allowed to work outside the scope of his residency training**: This is not entirely accurate; residents can moonlight but must adhere to regulations.
- **(E) He may work up to 20 more hours**: This is misleading; the total should not exceed 80 hours.

Given these considerations, the most accurate statement regarding this resident's moonlighting and patient safety is:

**(D) He may work more hours on Sundays.**

This option reflects that he has time available and can potentially work more hours as long as he remains within the ACGME guidelines for total hours worked per week.
Path 2: Let's analyze the situation step by step.

1. The resident is currently working 60 hours per week within his residency program, which is already a significant commitment. 
2. He also has an additional 10-hour shift on Saturdays, bringing his total to 70 hours per week.
3. The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) has specific guidelines regarding work hours for residents to ensure patient safety and resident well-being.
4. According to the ACGME, residents should not exceed 80 hours of work per week, averaged over four weeks. This includes all clinical duties and any moonlighting activities.
5. Given that the resident has no obligations on Sundays, he technically has the capacity to work more hours, but patient safety must be the priority.

Now, let's evaluate the options:
- (A) He is already overcommitting and must reduce the number of hours: This could be true considering the total hours he is working.
- (B) He is not allowed to work outside the scope of his residency training: This is not entirely accurate as residents can moonlight, but it must be within restrictions.
- (C) He may work longer shifts: This is not specific enough and could lead to overworking.
- (D) He may work more hours on Sundays: This is possible but would need to consider the total weekly hour limit.
- (E) He may work up to 20 more hours: This is misleading because he should not exceed 80 hours total.

Considering these points, the most accurate statement regarding this resident’s moonlighting and patient safety is:
**(A) He is already overcommitting and must reduce the number of hours.** 

This emphasizes the importance of maintaining a safe workload for himself and ensuring patient safety.
Path 3: Let's analyze the situation step by step. The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) sets guidelines regarding the work hours of residents to ensure both their education and patient safety. 

1. **Current Work Hours**: The resident is already working 60 hours per week in his residency program. ACGME guidelines generally limit residents to a maximum of 80 hours of work per week, averaged over a four-week period.

2. **External Shifts**: He has a 10-hour shift on Saturdays, bringing his total to 70 hours if he adds that to his residency hours. 

3. **Free Time**: He has Sundays free from any obligations, which means he could potentially use that day for moonlighting.

4. **Guidelines**: According to ACGME, residents can moonlight (work outside their residency obligations) but must ensure that their total hours do not exceed the 80-hour limit, and they must be able to manage their educational responsibilities without compromising patient safety.

5. **Patient Safety**: The ACGME emphasizes that any additional work (moonlighting) must not interfere with the resident's ability to fulfill their residency duties effectively and must not compromise patient safety.

Given these considerations, the most accurate statement regarding this resident's moonlighting and patient safety is:

**Answer: (D) He may work more hours on Sundays.**

This is because he is currently at 70 hours/week, and he could add additional hours on Sunday without exceeding the ACGME limit of 80 hours per week, as long as it does not interfere with his educational responsibilities.
Path 4: Let's analyze the situation step by step. 

The resident is already working 60 hours per week in his residency program, which is typical for many residency programs. He is also working an additional 10-hour shift on Saturdays, bringing his total to 70 hours per week. 

According to the ACGME guidelines, residents are generally limited to a maximum of 80 hours of work per week averaged over a four-week period. This includes all hours worked in both residency obligations and any additional moonlighting hours. 

Since the resident has Sundays free and is looking to work more hours, we need to consider the total hours he is allowed to work while ensuring patient safety and his well-being. 

- Option (C) "He may work longer shifts" does not directly address the total hour limitations.
- Option (A) "He is already overcommitting and must reduce the number of hours" is not accurate since he is within the limits but close to the maximum.
- Option (D) "He may work more hours on Sundays" could be true but does not specify the limits or implications.
- Option (B) "He is not allowed to work outside the scope of his residency training" is misleading since moonlighting is generally permissible as long as it does not interfere with training.
- Option (E) "He may work up to 20 more hours" is incorrect since he cannot exceed the 80-hour maximum limit; he has only 10 hours available.

Given this evaluation, the most accurate statement regarding his situation, considering patient safety and the ACGME guidelines, is that he may work more hours on Sundays, but he must ensure that he does not exceed the total of 80 hours per week. 

Thus, the best answer is:

**(D) He may work more hours on Sundays.**
Path 5: Let's analyze the situation based on the ACGME guidelines regarding work hours for residents. The ACGME has set limits on the number of hours residents can work per week to ensure patient safety and the well-being of the residents themselves.

1. **Current Work Hours**: The resident is already working 60 hours per week in his residency program and has an additional 10-hour shift on Saturdays, totaling 70 hours.
2. **ACGME Work Hour Standards**: ACGME standards typically limit residents to a maximum of 80 hours of work per week, averaged over a 4-week period. However, this includes all work-related hours, including both residency duties and any moonlighting activities.
3. **Moonlighting**: Residents may engage in moonlighting, but it must not interfere with their residency training or patient safety. It is essential that any additional hours worked do not exceed the overall 80-hour limit.

Given these points, the most accurate statement regarding this resident’s moonlighting and patient safety, based on the ACGME standards, is:

**(D) He may work more hours on Sundays.**

This option is correct because he has no obligations on Sundays, and as long as he does not exceed the total maximum 80-hour limit with his additional hours, he can work more on that day.
Path 6: Let's think step by step. 

The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) has established work hour regulations to ensure the safety and well-being of residents and their patients. According to the ACGME guidelines, residents typically may not exceed 80 hours of work per week, averaged over a four-week period, including both residency obligations and any additional work (moonlighting). 

In this scenario, the resident is already working 60 hours per week as part of their residency and is taking on an additional 10-hour shift externally. This totals to 70 hours per week. He is free on Sundays and is considering working more hours on that day, which could put him at risk of exceeding the ACGME limit if he were to work more than 10 additional hours.

Now, let's evaluate the options:
- (C) He may work longer shifts: This is not necessarily true, as the total number of hours must not exceed the ACGME limits.
- (A) He is already overcommitting and must reduce the number of hours: This isn't accurate since he is not over the limit yet.
- (D) He may work more hours on Sundays: This could be true, but it depends on how many hours he chooses to work; he risks exceeding the limit.
- (B) He is not allowed to work outside the scope of his residency training: Not entirely true; residents can moonlight but must adhere to work hour restrictions.
- (E) He may work up to 20 more hours: This is incorrect because he has already worked 70 hours and cannot exceed 80 hours total.

Based on the current regulations, the most accurate statement regarding this resident’s moonlighting and patient safety is: 

(D) He may work more hours on Sundays, but he must ensure that his total hours do not exceed the ACGME 80-hour limit. 

If we have to strictly answer the question considering the phrasing of the options, (D) comes closest to being correct while highlighting the need for caution regarding total hours worked.
Path 7: Let's think step by step. According to the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) standards, residents are limited in the total number of work hours they can perform, which typically should not exceed 80 hours per week, averaged over a 4-week period, including both residency and any external work (moonlighting). 

In this case, the resident currently works 60 hours per week in his residency and 10 hours on Saturdays, totaling 70 hours. Since he has no obligations on Sundays, he could potentially work additional hours on that day. However, while he can moonlight, the ACGME also emphasizes that this should not interfere with his residency training and should not compromise patient safety.

Given this context, the most accurate statement regarding this resident’s moonlighting and patient safety is:

(D) He may work more hours on Sundays. 

This is because he is currently at 70 hours and could potentially work more on Sundays without exceeding the ACGME limit of 80 hours per week. However, it is essential to ensure that the additional hours do not negatively affect his performance and training as a resident.
Path 8: Let's analyze the situation step by step. The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) has established guidelines regarding the maximum number of hours resident physicians can work to ensure patient safety and the well-being of residents. 

1. **Current Work Hours**: The resident is already working 60 hours per week in the residency program.
2. **Additional Hours**: He is currently moonlighting for 10 hours on Saturdays, which brings his total to 70 hours per week.
3. **ACGME Regulations**: According to ACGME guidelines, residents should not exceed 80 hours of work per week, averaged over a 4-week period. This includes all clinical work, which combines both residency and moonlighting hours.
4. **Sundays**: Since he has no obligations on Sundays and is not at risk of exceeding the 80-hour limit if he works additional hours, he could potentially work more hours on Sundays as long as the total does not exceed the 80-hour limit.

Considering these points, the most accurate statement regarding this resident's moonlighting and patient safety is:

**(D) He may work more hours on Sundays.**

This option reflects the possibility of him safely increasing his hours without exceeding the ACGME's work hour limits.
Path 9: Let's analyze the situation step by step, focusing on the ACGME's regulations regarding resident work hours and moonlighting.

1. **Current Work Hours**: The resident is currently working 60 hours per week within his residency program. Additionally, he is working an extra 10-hour shift on Saturdays, bringing his total to 70 hours per week.

2. **ACGME Regulations**: According to the ACGME, residents are limited to a maximum of 80 hours of work per week, averaged over a four-week period. This includes both residency hours and any additional moonlighting hours.

3. **Sunday Availability**: The resident is free on Sundays and could potentially work additional hours on that day.

4. **Safety and Well-being**: While the ACGME allows moonlighting, it also emphasizes the importance of resident well-being and patient safety. Overworking can lead to fatigue, which can negatively impact patient care.

Given the context, the most accurate statement regarding this resident’s moonlighting and patient safety is:

**(D) He may work more hours on Sundays.**

This option aligns with the regulations, as he is not exceeding the total maximum limit of 80 hours per week even if he works additional hours on Sunday, given that he is currently at 70 hours. However, it is crucial to consider the implications of fatigue and ensure that he maintains a balance to ensure patient safety and his own well-being.
Path 10: Let's think step by step. The ACGME sets specific work hour limits for residents to ensure patient safety and resident wellbeing. As of the most recent standards, residents should not exceed 80 hours of work per week, averaged over a 4-week period, including any moonlighting hours. 

In this scenario, the resident is currently working 60 hours per week in his residency program and has an additional 10-hour shift on Saturdays, totaling 70 hours. This leaves him with the potential to work an additional 10 hours on Sundays without exceeding the 80-hour limit.

Based on this information, the most accurate statement regarding the resident’s moonlighting and patient safety is (D) He may work more hours on Sundays.

Question: A 32-year-old man comes to the physician because of severe burning with urination for the past 3 days. During this period, he has had clear urethral discharge early in the morning. He has no history of serious illness, except for a rash following treatment with erythromycin 20 years ago. The patient takes no medications. He is sexually active with one male and one female partner; they use condoms inconsistently. His younger brother was diagnosed with Crohn disease at the age of 24 years. The patient does not smoke. He drinks one to two beers on weekends. He appears well. Temperature is 36.8°C (98°F), pulse is 75/min, and blood pressure is 135/78 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Gram stain of a urethral swab shows neutrophils but no organisms. Which of the following is the most likely causal pathogen? (B) Adenovirus (A) Neisseria gonorrhoeae (C) Trichomonas vaginalis (E) Herpes simplex virus
" (D) Chlamydia trachomatis
Reason: The symptoms described, including burning with urination and clear urethral discharge, along with the laboratory finding of neutrophils but no organisms on a Gram stain, suggest a urethritis that is likely caused by a pathogen that may not be easily visualized or cultivated, such as Chlamydia trachomatis. This organism is a common cause of urethritis, particularly in sexually active individuals, and is consistent with the patient's history of inconsistent condom use and recent sexual activity.
Answer: (D) Chlamydia trachomatis

Question: A 4-year-old boy with beta thalassemia requires regular blood transfusions a few times per month because of persistent anemia. He is scheduled for a splenectomy in the next several months. Samples obtained from the boy’s red blood cells show a malformed protein with a length of 160 amino acids (in normal, healthy red blood cells, the functional protein has a length of 146 amino acids). Which of the following best accounts for these findings? (B) Missense mutation (C) Nonsense mutation (A) Frameshift mutation (D) Silent mutation (E) Splice site mutation
Reason: The presence of a malformed protein that has a different length (160 amino acids instead of the normal 146) suggests that there was an alteration in the process of protein synthesis, likely affecting how RNA is processed. A splice site mutation can result in the inclusion of additional non-coding sequences or exclusion of coding sequences, which can lead to a longer or improperly modified protein, aligning with the observation in this case.
Answer: (E) Splice site mutation

Question: A 63-year-old man presents to the emergency room because of worsening breathlessness that began overnight. He was diagnosed with asthma 3 years ago and has been using albuterol and steroid inhalers. He does not have a prior history of cardiac disease or other respiratory diseases. The man is a retired insurance agent and has lived his entire life in the United States. His vital signs include: respiratory rate 40/min, blood pressure 130/90 mm Hg, pulse rate 110/min, and temperature 37.0°C (98.6°F). Physical examination shows severe respiratory distress, with the patient unable to lie down on the examination table. Auscultation of the chest reveals widespread wheezes in the lungs and the presence of S3 gallop rhythm. The man is admitted to hospital and laboratory investigations and imaging studies are ordered. Test results include the following:
WBC count 18.6 × 109/L
Eosinophil cell count 7.6 × 109/L (40% eosinophils)
Troponin T 0.5 ng/mL
Anti-MPO (P-ANCA) antibodies positive
Anti-PR3-C-ANCA negative
Immunoglobulin E 1,000 IU/mL
Serological tests for HIV, echovirus, adenovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and parvovirus B19 are negative. ECG shows regular sinus tachycardia with an absence of strain pattern or any evidence of ischemia. Transthoracic echocardiography reveals a dilated left ventricle with an ejection fraction of 30% (normal is 55% or greater). Which of the following diagnoses best explains the clinical presentation and laboratory findings in this patient? (A) Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) (C) Primary dilated cardiomyopathy (B) Chagas disease (D) Loeffler's endocarditis (E) Extrinsic asthma
Reason: The answer (A) Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) is supported by the elevated eosinophil count and the presence of pericardial effusion or cardiomyopathy, along with the respiratory distress and wheezing, which suggest a systemic vasculitis affecting multiple organ systems. The positive anti-MPO (P-ANCA) antibody and the patient's history of asthma further indicate an underlying eosinophilic process compatible with EGPA, which often presents with asthma, eosinophilia, and cardiac involvement.
Answer: (A) Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA)

Question: A 40-year-old man presents to a clinic in Michigan in December complaining of painful blue fingers and toes. He also complains of numbness and tingling. The patient’s vital signs are within normal limits, and his symptoms typically disappear when he comes back into a warm room. The patient also notes that he recently moved to the area from Arizona and had recently recovered from a viral infection in which he had a low-grade fever and severe lymphadenopathy. Which of the following tests would most likely be positive in this patient? (E) Anti-Ro antibody (D) Anti-centromere antibody (B) Direct Coomb’s test with anti-IgG reagent (A) Indirect Coomb’s test (C) Direct Coomb’s test with anti-C3 reagent
Reason: The symptoms described in this case, particularly the painful blue fingers and toes that improve with warmth, suggest the diagnosis of Raynaud's phenomenon, which can be associated with autoimmune conditions. The recent viral infection and the patient's symptoms may indicate an underlying autoimmune process, making the Direct Coomb’s test with anti-C3 reagent a relevant investigation, as it reflects immune-mediated hemolysis and can be associated with conditions like lupus, which might present with these symptoms.
Answer: (C) Direct Coomb’s test with anti-C3 reagent

Question: A 63-year-old woman visits her family physician because she has been experiencing difficulty to get her urine stream started in the past 8 months with many occasions needing extra effort to pass the urine. She describes the stream as intermittent and slow, and comments that she needs to go to the restroom again immediately after urinating. Her personal medical history is negative for malignancies, and all of her cytologies have been reported as normal. The only medication she takes is an angiotensin receptor blocker to treat essential hypertension diagnosed 5 years ago. Physical examination is unremarkable except for herniation of the anterior wall of the vagina that goes beyond the hymen. Which of the following types of incontinence is affecting the patient? (E) Functional incontinence (C) Mixed incontinence (A) Stress incontinence (B) Urgency incontinence (D) Overflow incontinence
Reason: The symptoms presented by the patient, including difficulty starting her urine stream, a weak and intermittent stream, and the sensation of incomplete bladder emptying, suggest that she is experiencing overflow incontinence. This condition is characterized by an over-distended bladder, which can occur due to conditions such as bladder outlet obstruction or weakened bladder contraction, leading to the leakage of urine when the bladder becomes overly full.
Answer: (D) Overflow incontinence

Question: A 5-year-old girl with an aortic stenosis correction comes to the office for a follow-up visit for acute lymphoblastic lymphoma. She initiated chemotherapy a week before through a peripherally inserted central line. She reports being ‘tired all the time’ and has been bruising easily. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows several tenders, non-blanching petechiae on the pads of the fingers and toes; several dark, non-tender petechiae on her palms and soles; and small, linear hemorrhages under her fingernails. Fundoscopic examination shows various small areas of hemorrhage on the retinae bilaterally. Cardiac examination is notable for a II/VI systolic ejection murmur that seems to have worsened in comparison to the last visit. Which of the following is the most likely cause? (D) Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (C) Dilated cardiomyopathy (E) Infective endocarditis (A) Acute rheumatic fever (B) Bleeding diathesis secondary to thrombocytopenia
Reason: The clinical presentation of the patient, particularly the easy bruising, petechiae, and linear hemorrhages under the fingernails, along with the evidence of retinal hemorrhages, raises suspicion for infectious processes that can lead to embolic phenomenon, such as infective endocarditis. In a child with a history of congenital heart disease and ongoing chemotherapy, the irritability and signs of possible infection make endocarditis a likely culprit, especially given the worsening of the previously noted systolic ejection murmur, indicating possible damage or vegetation on the heart valves.
Answer: (E) Infective endocarditis

Question: A 1-week-old baby is brought to the pediatrician’s office for a routine checkup. On examination, she is observed to have microcephaly with a prominent occiput. She also has clenched fists and rocker-bottom feet with prominent calcanei. A cardiac murmur is evident on auscultation. Based on the clinical findings, a diagnosis of nondisjunction of chromosome 18 is suspected. The pediatrician orders a karyotype for confirmation. He goes on to explain to the mother that her child will face severe growth difficulties. Even if her daughter progresses beyond a few months, she will not be able to reach developmental milestones at the appropriate age. In addition to the above, which of the following is most likely a consequence of this genetic disturbance? (E) Macroglossia (C) Death within the first year life (D) Cutis aplasia (A) Alzheimer’s disease (B) Supravalvular aortic stenosis
Reason: The most likely consequence of this genetic disturbance is (C) Death within the first year of life. The clinical presentation of the baby, including microcephaly, clenched fists, rocker-bottom feet, and cardiac murmurs, is suggestive of Trisomy 18 (Edwards syndrome), which is associated with significant morbidity and a high mortality rate within the first year of life due to severe congenital abnormalities and associated complications.

Question: A 62-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of a 4-hour history of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and confusion. His wife reports that he had blurry vision on the way to the hospital. Two weeks ago, he lost his job and since then has been extremely worried about their financial situation and future. He has congestive heart failure and atrial fibrillation well controlled with combination medical therapy. His temperature is 36.5°C (97.7°F), pulse is 57/min and irregular, respirations are 14/min, and blood pressure is 118/63 mm Hg. The patient is oriented only to person. Serum studies show:
Na+ 138 mEq/L
Cl− 100 mEq/L
K+ 5.3 mEq/L
HCO3− 25 mEq/L
Blood urea nitrogen 14 mg/dL
Creatinine 0.9 mg/dL
An ECG shows premature ventricular beats. The drug most likely responsible for this patient's symptoms has which of the following mechanisms of action?" (E) Blockade of beta-adrenergic receptors (B) Inhibition of Na+-K+-2Cl--cotransporters (D) Inhibition of Na+/K+-ATPase (A) Inhibition of funny channels (C) Blockade of aldosterone receptors
Reason: The drug most likely responsible for this patient's symptoms has the mechanism of action of (D) Inhibition of Na+/K+-ATPase. Given the patient's history of congestive heart failure and atrial fibrillation, the symptoms of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and confusion, combined with the presence of premature ventricular beats, suggest digoxin toxicity, which occurs due to the drug's mechanism of inhibiting the Na+/K+-ATPase pump. This inhibition leads to increased intracellular calcium and can result in gastrointestinal and neurological symptoms as well as arrhythmias.
Answer: (D) Inhibition of Na+/K+-ATPase

Question: A 65-year-old man presents to the emergency department by ambulance following a motor vehicle accident. He was a restrained passenger. At the hospital, he is bleeding heavily from a large wound in his left leg. A review of medical records reveals a history of atrial fibrillation for which he takes warfarin. His international normalized ratio (INR) 2 days ago was 2.6. On physical exam he is cool and clammy. The vital signs include: heart rate 130/min and blood pressure 96/54 mm Hg. Aggressive resuscitation with intravenous normal saline is begun. Which of the following is the next best step to correct this patient's underlying coagulopathy? (B) Give fresh frozen plasma (FFP) (E) Give platelets (A) Give cryoprecipitate (D) Give packed red blood cells (C) Give intravenous vitamin K
Reason: The answer is (B) Give fresh frozen plasma (FFP) because the patient is experiencing bleeding due to an elevated INR resulting from warfarin therapy, indicating a coagulopathy. FFP contains clotting factors that can quickly reverse the anticoagulant effects of warfarin, effectively addressing the bleeding and restoring hemostasis.

Question: Three days after undergoing cardiac catheterization and coronary angioplasty for acute myocardial infarction, a 70-year-old man develops shortness of breath at rest. He has hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His current medications include aspirin, clopidogrel, atorvastatin, sublingual nitroglycerin, metoprolol, and insulin. He appears diaphoretic. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 120/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 100/55 mm Hg. Crackles are heard at both lung bases. Cardiac examination shows a new grade 3/6 holosystolic murmur heard best at the cardiac apex. An ECG shows sinus rhythm with T wave inversion in leads II, III, and aVF. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this patient's symptoms? (D) Coronary artery dissection (A) Early infarct-associated pericarditis (C) Postmyocardial infarction syndrome (B) Ventricular septal rupture (E) Papillary muscle rupture
Reason: The answer is (E) Papillary muscle rupture because this patient presents with new-onset shortness of breath, crackles on lung examination, and a holosystolic murmur, which are indicative of acute heart failure due to severe mitral regurgitation caused by the rupture. This complication can occur after myocardial infarction, particularly in older patients, due to ischemia of the heart muscle affecting the papillary muscles that support the heart valves.

Question: A 71-year-old man comes to the physician because of decreased sexual performance for the past 2 years. He reports that it takes longer for his penis to become erect, and he cannot maintain an erection for as long as before. His ejaculations have become less forceful. Once he has achieved an orgasm, he requires several hours before he can have another orgasm. He has been happily married for 40 years and he has no marital conflicts. His only medication is esomeprazole for gastroesophageal reflux disease. Examination shows coarse dark pubic and axillary hair. The skin of his lower extremity is warm to the touch; pedal pulses and sensation are intact. Rectal examination shows a symmetrically enlarged prostate with no masses. His fasting serum glucose is 96 mg/dL and his prostate-specific antigen is 3.9 ng/mL (N < 4). Which of the following etiologies is the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms? (C) Neoplastic (E) Physiologic (D) Neurogenic (B) Psychogenic (A) Vascular
Reason: The answer is (E) Physiologic because the patient's symptoms, including gradual changes in sexual performance and erectile function over a two-year period, are likely due to normal age-related physiological changes in sexual function rather than a specific medical condition or psychological issue. The presence of coarse dark hair and the man's age suggest that hormonal changes associated with aging, such as decreased testosterone levels, could also contribute to his symptoms, reinforcing that the etiology is likely physiological rather than vascular, neurogenic, psychogenic, or neoplastic.
Answer: (E) Physiologic

Question: You conduct a medical research study to determine the screening efficacy of a novel serum marker for colon cancer. The study is divided into 2 subsets. In the first, there are 500 patients with colon cancer, of which 450 are found positive for the novel serum marker. In the second arm, there are 500 patients who do not have colon cancer, and only 10 are found positive for the novel serum marker. What is the overall sensitivity of this novel test? (C) 490 / (50 + 490) (E) 490 / (450 + 490) (A) 450 / (450 + 50) (D) 450 / (450 + 10) (B) 490 / (10 + 490)
Reason: To determine the overall sensitivity of the novel serum marker test for colon cancer, you need to calculate it based on the true positives and false negatives. In this scenario, sensitivity is defined as the number of true positives (patients with colon cancer who test positive) divided by the total number of individuals with colon cancer (true positives plus false negatives). Here, the true positives are 450 (patients with colon cancer testing positive), and the false negatives are 50 (patients with colon cancer who tested negative). Thus, the sensitivity is calculated as 450 / (450 + 50), which matches answer (A).
Answer: (A) 450 / (450 + 50)

Question: A 62-year-old man, who is known to have recurrent thromboembolic strokes, presents to his physician for a routine follow-up visit. While assessing drug compliance, the physician realizes that the patient inadvertently doubled his dose of warfarin 1 month ago. When he is asked about any new complaints, the patient denies any symptoms, including bleeding. The physical examination does not show any signs of bleeding. Based on the patient’s lifestyle, the physician does not consider him to be at increased risk for bleeding. He then orders an international normalized ratio (INR) for this patient, which is 13.5. In addition to temporarily holding warfarin, which of the following drugs is indicated for this patient? (A) Fresh frozen plasma (C) Recombinant factor VIIa (E) Protamine sulfate (B) Phytonadione (D) Menaquinone
Reason: The appropriate treatment in this scenario is phytonadione (also known as vitamin K), which is used to reverse the effects of warfarin when the INR is significantly elevated, as in this case (INR 13.5). Although fresh frozen plasma can be used in cases of life-threatening bleeding or very high INR, in a patient without active bleeding, administering phytonadione is the recommended approach to safely restore coagulation levels.
Answer: (B) Phytonadione

Question: A 52-year-old man presents to the office for a diabetes follow-up visit. He currently controls his diabetes through lifestyle modification only. He monitors his blood glucose at home with a glucometer every day. He gives the doctor a list of his most recent early morning fasting glucose readings from the past 8 days which are: 128 mg/dL, 130 mg/dL, 132 mg/dL, 125 mg/dL, 134 mg/dL, 127 mg/dL, 128 mg/dL, and 136 mg/dL. Which of the following values is the median of this data set? (E) 130 mg/dL (A) 128 mg/dL (D) 132 mg/dL (C) 129 mg/dL (B) 127 mg/dL
Reason: To find the median of the given data set, you first arrange the fasting glucose readings in ascending order: 125 mg/dL, 127 mg/dL, 128 mg/dL, 128 mg/dL, 130 mg/dL, 132 mg/dL, 134 mg/dL, and 136 mg/dL. Since there are eight values (an even number), the median is calculated by taking the average of the two middle values, which are the fourth (128 mg/dL) and fifth (130 mg/dL) numbers. Therefore, the median is (128 + 130) / 2 = 129 mg/dL, confirming that the correct answer is (C) 129 mg/dL.

Question: A 70-year-old man presents for his annual check-up. He says he feels well except for occasional abdominal pain. He describes the pain as 4/10–5/10 in intensity, diffusely localized to the periumbilical and epigastric regions, radiating to the groin. The pain occurs 1–2 times a month and always subsides on its own. The patient denies any recent history of fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, change in body weight, or change in bowel and/or bladder habits. His past medical history is significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and peripheral vascular disease, managed with lisinopril and simvastatin. The patient reports a 40-pack-year smoking history and 1–2 alcoholic drinks a day. The blood pressure is 150/100 mm Hg and the pulse is 80/min. Peripheral pulses are 2+ bilaterally in all extremities. Abdominal exam reveals a bruit in the epigastric region along with mild tenderness to palpation with no rebound or guarding. There is also a pulsatile abdominal mass felt on deep palpation at the junction of the periumbilical and the suprapubic regions. The remainder of the physical exam is normal. Laboratory studies show:
Serum total cholesterol 175 mg/dL
Serum total bilirubin 1 mg/dL
Serum amylase 25 U/L
Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 20 U/L
Serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 16 U/L
Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient? (C) Mesenteric ischemia (A) Abdominal aortic aneurysm (D) Acute gastritis (B) Acute pancreatitis (E) Diverticulitis
Reason: The patient's presentation is highly suggestive of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Key indicators include his age, history of hypertension and peripheral vascular disease, the presence of a pulsatile abdominal mass, and an epigastric bruit, which are classic signs associated with AAA. Additionally, the nature of the abdominal pain—as intermittent and not accompanied by alarming symptoms such as fever or significant weight loss—also supports this diagnosis.

Question: An 8-year-old boy presents to your office for a routine well-child visit. Upon physical examination, he is found to have a harsh-sounding, holosystolic murmur that is best appreciated at the left sternal border. The murmur becomes louder when you ask him to make fists with his hands. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for these findings? (B) Tricuspid atresia (C) Pulmonary hypertension (E) Left ventricular hypertrophy (D) Ventricular septal defect (A) Aortic stenosis
Reason: The findings in this case are most consistent with a ventricular septal defect (VSD), as the patient presents with a holosystolic murmur best heard at the left sternal border, which is characteristic of this condition. The increase in murmur intensity when the patient clenches his fists indicates increased systemic vascular resistance, leading to elevated left-to-right shunting across the defect, further supporting the diagnosis of a VSD.

(A) The patient is at a high risk for torsades de pointes (B) There is a high risk for retinopathy (E) Tardive dyskinesia will likely result from the prolonged use of olanzapine (D) The patient may develop galactorrhea (C) The patient has type 2 diabetes
Reason: Olanzapine is an atypical antipsychotic that is known to cause weight gain and metabolic side effects, including worsening glucose control, which can be particularly detrimental for patients with type 2 diabetes. Given the patient's pre-existing condition of diabetes, initiating olanzapine might exacerbate her glycemic control and lead to further complications associated with her diabetes.
Answer: (C) The patient has type 2 diabetes

[INFO] Opinion paths:
Path 1: Let's analyze the question step by step.

The scenario describes a woman with infertility issues, possibly due to hormonal imbalances, which could be related to conditions like polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). A common treatment for infertility related to hormonal issues is Clomiphene citrate, which is often administered in a manner where it is taken for a short duration during the menstrual cycle to stimulate ovulation.

If Clomiphene citrate were administered differently (e.g., in a continuous manner rather than intermittently), it would not be effective for other conditions, but the main treatment for PCOS can involve medications that are used to manage insulin levels, such as Metformin.

However, focusing on the administration of the drug mentioned in the question, if we consider potential treatments for the conditions listed, we can analyze:

- (C) Polycystic ovarian syndrome - Can be treated with Clomiphene citrate or Metformin.
- (D) Premature labor - Typically treated with tocolytics (not related to Clomiphene).
- (A) Diabetes - Treated with insulin or oral hypoglycemics (not related to Clomiphene).
- (B) Parkinson disease - Treated with dopaminergic medications (not related to Clomiphene).
- (E) Prostate cancer - Treated with hormonal therapy (not related to Clomiphene).

Considering the information and the common medications used for treating various conditions, the most relevant condition that could also be treated with Clomiphene citrate (if administered differently) is:

Answer: (C) Polycystic ovarian syndrome
Path 2: Let's think through the details.

The scenario describes a 28-year-old woman with infertility issues who has had abdominal surgery and a family history of endocrine abnormalities. Given the context, it’s likely that her treatment involves hormonal therapy, possibly to stimulate ovulation. 

The mention of administering treatment intermittently one week before her normal menstrual cycle suggests the use of a drug like clomiphene citrate (Clomid), which is often used to induce ovulation in women who have difficulty conceiving.

Now, if clomiphene citrate (or a similar medication) was administered differently or in a different context, it could also be applicable in the treatment for Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), which is often characterized by ovulatory dysfunction and could lead to infertility.

With this understanding, the option regarding Polycystic ovarian syndrome (C) aligns well with the treatment context discussed.

**Answer: (C) Polycystic ovarian syndrome**
Path 3: Let's think step by step. 

The scenario describes a woman who has been trying to conceive unsuccessfully for 2 years, with a history of abdominal surgery and endocrine issues, which suggests a potential hormonal imbalance affecting her fertility. The treatment that is likely being administered intermittently one week before her normal menstrual cycle is probably a form of hormonal therapy, such as progesterone, to help regulate her menstrual cycle and support potential implantation if conception occurs.

Now, if we consider the possible treatments and the conditions listed in the options, we can analyze them:

- (A) Diabetes: Insulin or other agents are used, but this doesn't fit with the intermittent hormonal therapy for fertility.
- (B) Parkinson disease: Treated with dopaminergic agents, not relevant here.
- (C) Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS): This condition can be treated with hormonal therapies, including progesterone or other medications to help induce ovulation.
- (D) Premature labor: Progesterone can be used to help prevent premature labor in some cases.
- (E) Prostate cancer: Treated with anti-androgens or other specific therapies, not related to the treatment for fertility.

Given that the treatment could be progesterone, which can also be used in the context of preventing premature labor, the most appropriate answer is:

Answer: (D) Premature labor
Path 4: Let's analyze the question step by step:

1. **Patient Background**: The patient is a 28-year-old woman who has been trying to conceive for 2 years. The history of prior abdominal surgery and endocrine abnormalities could suggest issues related to ovulation or hormonal imbalances.

2. **Treatment Timing**: The treatment is to be administered intermittently one week before her normal menstrual cycle, which suggests a medication related to ovulation induction or hormonal regulation.

3. **Potential Medications**: Given the context, the most likely drug prescribed could be a form of hormonal therapy, such as clomiphene citrate, which is commonly used to induce ovulation in women facing infertility issues.

4. **Alternative Uses of the Drug**: If clomiphene citrate were administered differently, it could also potentially be used in conditions like Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), where ovulation induction is often necessary. 

5. **Evaluation of Options**:
   - (C) Polycystic ovarian syndrome: This condition is related to ovulatory dysfunction, which can be treated with clomiphene citrate.
   - (D) Premature labor: This typically requires other medications, such as tocolytics.
   - (A) Diabetes: This is treated with insulin or oral hypoglycemics, not clomiphene.
   - (B) Parkinson disease: Treated with dopaminergic medications, not clomiphene.
   - (E) Prostate cancer: Treated with hormonal therapy specific to androgens, not clomiphene.

6. **Conclusion**: Based on the reasoning above, the answer is that the drug can also be used to treat (C) Polycystic ovarian syndrome.

**Final Answer**: (C) Polycystic ovarian syndrome.
Path 5: Let's analyze the question step by step.

The scenario describes a 28-year-old woman with a history of infertility, possible hormonal abnormalities, and prior abdominal surgery. The treatment mentioned is administered intermittently one week before her normal menstrual cycle, which suggests a medication that is typically used in the context of fertility treatments.

Given the context, the most likely drug prescribed for this patient would be a form of hormone therapy, likely to induce ovulation. Common medications that are used for this purpose include Clomiphene citrate or gonadotropins.

Among the options provided, let's assess which condition might be treated by one of these medications if administered differently:

- (C) Polycystic ovarian syndrome: Often treated with medications like Clomiphene citrate, which is used to induce ovulation.
- (D) Premature labor: This is typically treated with tocolytics which are not related to the medications used for fertility.
- (A) Diabetes: Generally managed with insulin or oral hypoglycemics, not related to fertility medications.
- (B) Parkinson disease: Treated with dopaminergic medications, not related to fertility treatments.
- (E) Prostate cancer: Treated with hormone therapies like androgen deprivation, which are not related to fertility drugs.

Based on the analysis, if the drug prescribed for this patient's infertility (likely Clomiphene citrate) is considered, it is also used for treating conditions like Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), where ovulation induction is necessary.

Thus, the answer is (C) Polycystic ovarian syndrome.
Path 6: Let's think step by step through the information provided in the question.

1. The patient is a 28-year-old woman who has been trying to conceive for 2 years, and she has undergone prior abdominal surgery and has a family history of endocrine abnormalities.
2. The treatment mentioned is administered intermittently one week before her normal menstrual cycle, which suggests it might be related to ovulation or hormone regulation.
3. Given the context, it's likely that the drug prescribed is a form of hormone therapy, such as clomiphene citrate, which is commonly used to induce ovulation in women with infertility issues.

Now, considering the options provided for conditions that may also be treated by the same drug if administered differently:

- (C) Polycystic ovarian syndrome: Clomiphene citrate is often used to treat infertility in women with PCOS by inducing ovulation.
- (D) Premature labor: This is usually treated with tocolytics, not the drug assumed here.
- (A) Diabetes: This would typically be treated with insulin or oral hypoglycemics, not clomiphene.
- (B) Parkinson disease: Treated with dopaminergic medications, not clomiphene.
- (E) Prostate cancer: Treated with androgen deprivation therapy or chemotherapy, not clomiphene.

Given that the most likely drug is clomiphene citrate, and it is also used to treat infertility associated with polycystic ovarian syndrome, the correct answer is:

**Answer: (C) Polycystic ovarian syndrome**
Path 7: Based on the information given, the scenario suggests that the woman may be receiving treatment related to infertility, potentially involving hormonal manipulation. A common drug used in such cases is clomiphene citrate, which is often prescribed for ovulation induction in women facing difficulties conceiving.

If clomiphene citrate were administered differently, it could potentially be used to treat conditions like Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), where ovulatory dysfunction is common. 

Thus, the answer to the question regarding which condition may also be treated by the drug (if administered in a different manner) is:

Answer: (C) Polycystic ovarian syndrome.
Path 8: Let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. **Patient Background**: The 28-year-old woman has been trying to conceive for 2 years and has a history of abdominal surgery and endocrine abnormalities. This suggests potential issues with ovulation or reproductive health.

2. **Treatment Timing**: The treatment is administered intermittently one week before her normal menstrual cycle. This suggests a medication that is often used to regulate or induce ovulation.

3. **Common Infertility Treatments**: Clomiphene citrate is a commonly prescribed medication for inducing ovulation in women with infertility issues, especially in cases of irregular ovulation or conditions like PCOS.

4. **Drug Administration**: If clomiphene citrate (or a similar ovulation-inducing drug) were given differently, it might be used in a continuous fashion rather than intermittently.

5. **Potential Other Conditions Treated**: Clomiphene citrate is primarily used for infertility but is not typically used for other conditions. However, if we consider medications like progestins, they can be used for a variety of conditions, including abnormal uterine bleeding, endometrial hyperplasia, and even in some cases of hormone replacement for menopausal symptoms.

6. **Options Given**: Let's evaluate the options:
   - (A) Diabetes: Treated with insulin or oral hypoglycemics, not relevant here.
   - (B) Parkinson disease: Treated with dopaminergic medications, not relevant here.
   - (C) Polycystic ovarian syndrome: Can be treated with medications that induce ovulation, relevant.
   - (D) Premature labor: Treated with tocolytics or progesterone, not typically related to the drug we suspect.
   - (E) Prostate cancer: Treated with anti-androgens or hormone therapy, not related.

Based on this analysis, the most relevant condition that can also be treated by the drug if administered differently would be **(C) Polycystic ovarian syndrome**, as it is a condition that is often associated with infertility and can be treated with ovulation-inducing agents. 

Answer: (C) Polycystic ovarian syndrome
Path 9: Let's analyze the scenario step by step. The patient has been trying to conceive and has a history that suggests a potential hormonal imbalance, particularly since she has a family history of endocrine abnormalities. 

Based on the details provided, the treatment that is likely administered intermittently one week before her menstrual cycle is likely progesterone, which is used to support the luteal phase and can help with conception.

Now, if progesterone were to be used in another context, one of the options provided could be a condition that is also treated with progesterone. 

Among the options:
- (A) Diabetes: This is typically managed with insulin or oral hypoglycemics, not progesterone.
- (B) Parkinson disease: Treated with dopaminergic medications, not progesterone.
- (C) Polycystic ovarian syndrome: This condition can be associated with hormonal imbalances, and progesterone can be used to induce a withdrawal bleed or regulate periods.
- (D) Premature labor: Progesterone is indeed used to help prevent preterm labor.
- (E) Prostate cancer: Usually treated with hormonal therapies that reduce testosterone levels, not progesterone.

Considering these options, if the drug (progesterone) is administered in a different manner, it could also be used to prevent premature labor.

Therefore, the most likely answer is (D) Premature labor.
Path 10: Let's analyze the question step by step. Given the patient's history of infertility, prior abdominal surgery, and family history of endocrine abnormalities, it suggests that she may be experiencing issues related to ovulation or hormonal imbalances. In the context of infertility, it's common to prescribe medications that induce ovulation, such as clomiphene citrate.

Now, if clomiphene citrate (or similar medications) were administered in a different manner, we can consider its other uses. Clomiphene citrate is primarily used for inducing ovulation but is not directly used for the conditions listed in the options. However, if we consider a medication like progesterone, which is often administered during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle or to support pregnancy, it can also be used in other contexts.

Among the options provided, let's examine them:

- (C) Polycystic ovarian syndrome: This condition can be treated with medications that induce ovulation, but specifically, it may not be directly related to the question about administering the drug differently.
- (D) Premature labor: Progesterone is indeed used to prevent premature labor, especially in women with a history of preterm birth.
- (A) Diabetes: Not typically treated with the mentioned medications.
- (B) Parkinson disease: Not relevant to the reproductive context.
- (E) Prostate cancer: Not directly relevant to the context of the case.

Since the question hints that the drug would be administered differently for another condition, and considering that progesterone can be used to prevent premature labor, the most likely answer would be:

Answer: (D) Premature labor.

Question: A 65-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 8-month history of worsening difficulties swallowing food and retrosternal chest discomfort. She reports that she sometimes has a feeling of “food getting stuck” in her throat and hears a “gurgling sound” from her throat while eating. She says that she occasionally coughs up pieces of undigested food. She has noticed a bad taste in her mouth and bad breath. She has not had fever or weight loss. She has been visiting Mexico every year for the past 7 years. She has Raynaud disease treated with nifedipine. Her father died because of gastric cancer. She had smoked one-half pack of cigarettes daily for 20 years but stopped 25 years ago. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Her hemoglobin concentration is 14 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9800/mm3, and platelet count is 215,000/mm3. An ECG shows sinus rhythm with no evidence of ischemia. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis? (C) Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (D) Esophageal pH monitoring (E) Endoscopic ultrasound (A) Barium esophagram (B) Serology and PCR
Reason: A barium esophagram is likely to confirm the diagnosis in this case because it is useful for visualizing structural abnormalities of the esophagus, such as strictures or motility disorders. Given the patient's symptoms of dysphagia, food "getting stuck," and the indication of possible esophageal obstruction, a barium swallow study would help identify any abnormal anatomy that could be causing these issues.
Answer: (A) Barium esophagram

Question: A 69-year-old man is brought in by his wife with acute onset aphasia for the past 5 hours. The patient’s wife says that they were sitting having dinner when suddenly he was not able to speak. They delayed coming to the hospital because he had a similar episode 2 months ago which resolved within an hour. His past medical history is significant for hypercholesterolemia, managed with rosuvastatin, and a myocardial infarction (MI) 2 months ago, status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty complicated by residual angina. His family history is significant for his father who died of MI at age 60. The patient reports a 15-pack-year smoking history but denies any alcohol or recreational drug use. The vital signs include: temperature 37.0℃ (98.6℉), blood pressure 125/85 mm Hg, pulse 96/min, and respiratory rate 19/min. On physical examination, the patient has productive aphasia. There is a weakness of the right-sided lower facial muscles. The strength in his upper and lower extremities is 4/5 on the right and 5/5 on the left. There is also a decreased sensation on his right side. A noncontrast computed tomography (CT) scan of the head is unremarkable. CT angiography (CTA) and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain are acquired, and the findings are shown in the exhibit (see image). Which of the following is the best course of treatment in this patient? (E) Mannitol (A) IV tPA (B) Aspirin (D) Mechanical thrombectomy (C) Low molecular weight heparin
Reason: Mechanical thrombectomy is the best course of treatment in this patient because he presents with acute onset of aphasia and focal neurological deficits consistent with an ischemic stroke, and given that he is within the appropriate window for intervention. The CT scan being unremarkable suggests that the ischemic event may not yet have caused significant structural changes, making him a candidate for thrombectomy if there is a large vessel occlusion identified on imaging, which is often the case in patients with acute neurological deficits like this one.
Answer: (D) Mechanical thrombectomy

Question: A 20-year-old man presents with a painless neck mass that has gradually increased in size. The mass is anteromedial to the right sternocleidomastoid muscle and has been present for 3 years. The mass increased in size and became more tender following an upper respiratory infection. An ultrasound of the neck identifies a single, round cystic mass with uniform, low echogenicity, and no internal septations. A contrast-enhanced CT scan of the neck shows a homogeneous mass with low attenuation centrally and with smooth rim enhancement. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? (E) Cervical lymphadenopathy (C) Second branchial cleft cyst (D) Sternomastoid tumor (B) Ectopic thyroid tissue (A) First branchial cleft cyst
Reason: A second branchial cleft cyst is the most likely diagnosis in this patient due to the location of the cystic mass and its characteristics on imaging. The anteromedial position relative to the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the chronicity of the mass, and its tenderness following an upper respiratory infection are consistent with a second branchial cleft cyst, which typically presents as a painless neck mass that can become inflamed or infected under certain conditions.
Answer: (C) Second branchial cleft cyst

Question: A 57-year-old man presents to his primary care provider because of chest pain for the past 3 weeks. The chest pain occurs after climbing more than 2 flight of stairs or walking for more than 10 minutes and resolves with rest. He is obese, has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, and has smoked 15-20 cigarettes a day for the past 25 years. His father died from a myocardial infarction at 52 years of age. Vital signs reveal a temperature of 36.7 °C (98.06°F), a blood pressure of 145/93 mm Hg, and a heart rate of 85/min. The physical examination is unremarkable. Which of the following best represents the most likely etiology of the patient’s condition? (B) Intermittent coronary vasospasm with or without coronary atherosclerosis (C) Sudden disruption of an atheromatous plaque, with a resulting occlusive thrombus (D) Fixed, atherosclerotic coronary stenosis (> 70%) (E) Hypertrophy of the interventricular septum (A) Multivessel atherosclerotic disease with or without a nonocclusive thrombus
Reason: The patient's symptoms of chest pain that occur with exertion and resolve with rest strongly suggest stable angina, which is typically caused by fixed atherosclerotic coronary artery disease. His risk factors, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, smoking history, and family history of premature coronary artery disease, further support the likelihood of significant atherosclerotic changes leading to fixed stenosis in the coronary arteries.
Answer: (D) Fixed, atherosclerotic coronary stenosis (> 70%)

Question: To study the flow of blood in the systemic circulation, partially occlusive stents are placed in the pulmonary trunk of a physiological system while the pressure in the right atrium is monitored. A graph where the right atrial pressure is a function of venous return is plotted. Assuming all circulatory nerve reflexes are absent in the system, at what point on the diagram shown below will the arterial pressure be closest to the venous pressure? (C) Point III (A) Point I (E) Point V (D) Point IV (B) Point II
Reason: In a physiological model of circulation without nerve reflexes, the arterial pressure approaches venous pressure at the point of low flow or high resistance, which would occur at Point III on the graph. At this point, the system's ability to maintain a pressure gradient diminishes, leading to equalization of pressures between the arteries and veins.
Answer: (C) Point III

Question: A 13-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother because she is concerned about her son's behavior. She reports that he has been wearing her dresses at home and asks to be called Lilly. He also stopped going to swim class because he “doesn't feel comfortable in swim trunks.” Since starting puberty about a year ago, he has not had any friends and the teachers report he is consistently being bullied at school. His academic performance has been poor for the last year even though he had maintained an A average the year before. The mother further reports that her son has had mainly female friends since preschool. She also mentions that as a child her son never enjoyed playing with typical boy toys like cars and instead preferred dressing up dolls. The patient was raised by his single mother from the age of 8 because his father left the family due to financial issues. He appears shy. Physical examination shows normal male external genitalia. There is scarce coarse, dark axillary and pubic hair. Upon questioning, the patient reports that he would rather be a girl. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? (C) Body dysmorphic disorder (E) Fetishistic disorder (D) Gender dysphoria (A) Gender nonconformity (B) Sexual aversion
Reason: The symptoms presented by the boy, including his preference for traditionally female clothing, desire to be called Lilly, discomfort with male clothing, and consistent female friendships, suggest a strong identification with the female gender. These feelings, especially when coupled with significant distress and social impairment as observed in the mother's report of bullying and academic decline, are characteristic of gender dysphoria.
Answer: (D) Gender dysphoria

Question: A 52-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of epigastric abdominal pain that started after her last meal and has become progressively worse over the past 6 hours. She has had intermittent pain similar to this before, but it has never lasted this long. Her temperature is 39°C (102.2°F). Examination shows a soft abdomen with normal bowel sounds. The patient has sudden inspiratory arrest during right upper quadrant palpation. Her alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, amylase, and aspartate aminotransferase levels are within the reference ranges. Abdominal imaging is most likely to show which of the following findings? (D) Decreased echogenicity of the liver (B) Gallstone in the cystic duct (C) Fistula formation between the gallbladder and bowel (E) Enlargement of the pancreas with peripancreatic fluid (A) Dilated common bile duct with intrahepatic biliary dilatation
Reason: The most likely finding on imaging for this patient is a gallstone in the cystic duct (B) because her presentation suggests acute cholecystitis, characterized by acute right upper quadrant pain, fever, and a positive Murphy's sign. The normal liver function tests and the acute nature of her symptoms, along with the history of intermittent pain, support the presence of a gallstone obstructing the cystic duct, which leads to inflammation and pain.

Question: A 9-year-old boy is brought to your office due to nausea and vomiting. He had 4 episodes of non-bloody and non-bilious emesis over the last 24 hours. He denies any diarrhea or changes in his diet; however, his best friend at school recently had viral gastroenteritis and his mother is concerned that he has the same bug. She notes that he has been drinking more water than usual and wet his bed twice over the last two weeks. He is otherwise healthy and is not taking any medications. On physical exam his temperature is 99°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 100/70 mmHg, pulse is 112/min, respirations are 26/min, and pulse oximetry is 99% on room air. He has lost 10 pounds since his previous visit 6 months ago. There is diffuse, mild abdominal tenderness to palpation. The most likely disease process responsible for this patient's symptoms is associated with which of the following? (E) No association with HLA system (A) HLA-B8 (D) HLA-DR5 (B) HLA-DR2 (C) HLA-DR3
Reason: The most likely disease process associated with this patient's symptoms is HLA-DR3 (C), which is linked to autoimmune conditions, including Type 1 diabetes mellitus. Given the boy’s signs of nausea, vomiting, increased thirst, and bedwetting combined with significant weight loss, these symptoms point towards the onset of diabetes, which is commonly associated with the HLA-DR3 haplotype.
Answer: (C) HLA-DR3

Question: A 32-year-old previously healthy female presents to her primary care physician with double vision. She first noted the double vision yesterday and saw no improvement this morning. She does not think it is worsening. She has not had any changes in her normal routine though she recalls one episode of right arm weakness 2 months ago. She did not seek treatment and the weakness subsided after several days. She does not have a history of head trauma. She denies headache, fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, paresthesias, extremity pain, or weakness. On exam she has right adduction palsy on leftward gaze. She has no focal weakness. Which of the following additional physical exam findings is associated with the lesion responsible for her ocular findings? (C) Proptosis of the right eye (A) Horizontal nystagmus in the left eye on leftward gaze (E) Afferent pupillary defect in the left eye (B) Ptosis on the right (D) Left abduction palsy on leftward gaze
Reason: The additional physical exam finding associated with the lesion responsible for the patient's ocular findings is horizontal nystagmus in the left eye on leftward gaze (A). The patient's right adduction palsy indicates an issue with the left abducens nerve or a lesion affecting the neural pathways controlling eye movement; in such cases, nystagmus often occurs as a compensatory response, particularly when the eye cannot adduct properly, leading to nystagmus in the fellow eye (in this case, the left eye) during attempted gaze towards the affected side.
Answer: (A) Horizontal nystagmus in the left eye on leftward gaze

Question: A 52-year-old man presents with 2 months of diarrhea, abdominal pain, and fatigue. He reports a weight loss of 4 kg (8 lb). He also says his joints have been hurting recently, as well. Past medical history is unremarkable. Review of systems is significant for problems with concentration and memory. Physical examination is unremarkable. A GI endoscopy is performed with a biopsy of the small bowel. Which of the following histologic finding would most likely be seen in this patient? (C) Non-caseating granulomas in the small intestine (B) Blunting of the villi (E) Presence of C. trachomatis in urine specimen (D) Absence of nerves in the myenteric plexus (A) PAS positive macrophages
Reason: The clinical presentation of the patient, including diarrhea, abdominal pain, fatigue, weight loss, joint pain, and cognitive difficulties, raises suspicion for a condition such as Whipple's disease. This disease is characterized by the presence of PAS-positive macrophages in the intestinal tissue, as these macrophages accumulate abnormal amounts of lysosomal material, which are detected with PAS staining.
Answer: (A) PAS positive macrophages

Question: A 56-year-old man is brought to the emergency department with increasing crampy abdominal pain and swelling over the past 2 days. He has not passed stool or flatus for over 12 hours. He has vomited twice. He has noted a lower stool caliber over the past month. His past medical history is unremarkable except for an appendectomy 8 years ago. He takes no medications. His temperature is 37.5°C (99.5°F), pulse is 82/min, respirations are 19/min, and blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg. Abdominal examination shows symmetric distension, active bowel sounds, and generalized tenderness without guarding or rebound tenderness. His leukocyte count is 10,000/mm3. An upright and supine X-ray of the abdomen are shown. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient’s recent condition? (A) Acute mesenteric ischemia (B) Adhesions (C) Diverticulitis (D) Ogilvie’s syndrome (E) Sigmoid tumor
Reason: The patient's symptoms, including increasing crampy abdominal pain, swelling, constipation, and lower stool caliber, suggest a possible obstruction in the gastrointestinal tract. Given his history of reduced stool caliber over the past month and the need for further evaluation via imaging studies, the presence of a sigmoid tumor could explain these findings as it is known to cause bowel obstruction by compressing or invading the surrounding structures, leading to the accumulation of bowel contents and the resulting symptoms.
Answer: (E) Sigmoid tumor

Question: A 61-year-old man presents with gradually increasing shortness of breath. For the last 2 years, he has had a productive cough on most days. Past medical history is significant for hypertension and a recent admission to the hospital for pneumonia. He uses a triamcinolone inhaler and uses an albuterol inhaler as a rescue inhaler. He also takes lisinopril and a multivitamin daily. He has smoked a pack a day for the last 32 years and has no intention to quit now. Today, his blood pressure is 142/97 mm Hg, heart rate is 97/min, respiratory rate is 22/min, and temperature is 37.4°C (99.3°F). On physical exam, he has tachypnea and has some difficulty finishing his sentences. His heart has a regular rate and rhythm. Auscultation of his lungs reveals wheezing and rhonchi that improves after a deep cough. Fremitus is absent. Pulmonary function tests show FEV1/FVC of 55% with no change in FEV1 after albuterol treatment. Which of the following is the most likely pathology associated with this patients disease? (B) Chronic granulomatous inflammation with bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy (D) Inflamed bronchus with hypertrophy and hyperplasia of mucous glands (E) Consolidation and red hepatization (A) Permanent bronchial dilation (C) Airway hypersensitivity
Reason: The correct answer is (D) Inflamed bronchus with hypertrophy and hyperplasia of mucous glands. This patient's presentation, particularly the productive cough, wheezing, and reduced FEV1/FVC ratio, is indicative of chronic bronchitis, a component of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Chronic bronchitis is characterized by inflammation of the airways, which leads to an increase in mucus production due to gland hypertrophy and hyperplasia, narrowing the airways and causing obstructive symptoms.
Answer: (D) Inflamed bronchus with hypertrophy and hyperplasia of mucous glands

Question: An 82-year-old man presents with painless swelling of the neck for the past week. He reports no recent fever, night sweats, or weight loss. He has no significant medical history, and his only medication is daily aspirin. His temperature is 36.8℃ (98.2℉). On physical examination, there are several non-tender lymph nodes, each averaging 2 cm in diameter, which are palpable in the right anterior cervical triangle. No other palpable lymphadenopathy is noted. The remainder of the physical exam is unremarkable. Laboratory studies show the following:
Hemoglobin 10 g/dL
Leukocyte count 8000/mm3 with a normal differential
Platelet count 250,000/mm3
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate
30 mm/h
An excisional biopsy of a cervical lymph node reveals the presence of Reed-Sternberg (RS) cells. Computed tomography (CT) scans and positron emission tomography (PET) scans reveal no mediastinal mass or signs of additional disease. Which of the following aspects most strongly indicates a good prognosis for this patient? (B) Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (E) Presence of B symptoms (A) Stage of the disease (D) Leukocyte count and differential (C) Hemoglobin level
Reason: The correct answer is (A) Stage of the disease. In Hodgkin lymphoma, the stage is one of the most critical factors in determining prognosis, as it indicates the extent of the disease at diagnosis and can significantly influence treatment options and overall outcomes. A lower stage (such as stage I or II) typically correlates with a better prognosis compared to higher stages (III or IV), especially in the absence of symptoms and with isolated lymph node involvement as seen in this patient.
Answer: (A) Stage of the disease

Question: A 57-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of tinnitus and progressive hearing loss in the left ear. She has type 2 diabetes mellitus and Raynaud syndrome. Her current medications include metformin, nifedipine, and a multivitamin. She appears well. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. A vibrating tuning fork is placed on the left mastoid process. Immediately after the patient does not hear a tone, the tuning fork is held over the left ear and she reports hearing the tuning fork again. The same test is repeated on the right side and shows the same pattern. The vibration tuning fork is then placed on the middle of the forehead and the patient hears the sound louder in the right ear. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? (C) Acoustic neuroma (B) Presbycusis (E) Ménière disease
" (D) Cerumen impaction (A) Meningioma
Reason: The correct answer is (C) Acoustic neuroma. The patient's progressive hearing loss and tinnitus, along with the results of the Rinne and Weber tests (where lateralization occurs to the right side while the left ear shows sensorineural hearing loss), suggest that there is a unilateral vestibular schwannoma (acoustic neuroma) affecting the left auditory nerve. In acoustic neuroma, sensorineural hearing loss typically occurs due to the tumor's impact on the auditory nerve, which correlates with the patient's specific symptoms and test findings.
Answer: (C) Acoustic neuroma

Question: A 56-year-old woman presents with sudden-onset severe headache, nausea, vomiting, and neck pain for the past 90 minutes. She describes her headache as a ‘thunderclap’, followed quickly by severe neck pain and stiffness, nausea and vomiting. She denies any loss of consciousness, seizure, or similar symptoms in the past. Her past medical history is significant for an episode 6 months ago where she suddenly had trouble putting weight on her right leg, which resolved within hours. The patient denies any history of smoking, alcohol or recreational drug use. On physical examination, the patient has significant nuchal rigidity. Her muscle strength in the lower extremities is 4/5 on the right and 5/5 on the left. The remainder of the physical examination is unremarkable. A noncontrast CT scan of the head is normal. Which of the following is the next best step in the management of this patient? (A) IV tPA (B) Lumbar puncture (E) Placement of a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt (D) Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging of the brain (C) T1/T2 MRI of the head
Reason: The correct answer is (B) Lumbar puncture. 

This patient presents with symptoms highly suggestive of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), especially the "thunderclap" headache, nuchal rigidity, and nausea. Although the non-contrast CT scan is normal, a lumbar puncture is warranted to assess for the presence of blood in the cerebrospinal fluid, which is a definitive method to confirm or rule out SAH when initial imaging does not show abnormalities.
Answer: (B) Lumbar puncture

Question: An 80-year-old man is admitted to the hospital after the sudden onset of sub-sternal chest pain and shortness of breath while sitting in a chair. He has hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for 42 years. Four days after admission, he becomes tachycardic and then loses consciousness; the cardiac monitor shows irregular electrical activity. Cardiac examination shows a new systolic murmur at the apex. Despite appropriate measures, he dies. Microscopic evaluation of the myocardium is most likely to show which of the following? (D) Dense granulation tissue with collagenous scar formation (B) Wavy myocardial fibers without inflammatory cells (E) Hyperemic granulation tissue with abundance of macrophages (A) Coagulative necrosis with dense neutrophilic infiltrate (C) Low cellularity with dense, non-contractile scar tissue
Reason: The correct answer is (E) Hyperemic granulation tissue with abundance of macrophages.

Given the context, the patient likely experienced a myocardial infarction (MI) that led to significant myocardial damage. Four days post-MI, the healing process begins, which typically results in the formation of granulation tissue characterized by hyperemia (increased blood flow) and a rich presence of macrophages, as they play a crucial role in cleaning up necrotic tissue and facilitating healing. This finding is consistent with the timeline of post-MI healing phases, particularly in the first week after infarction.
Answer: (E) Hyperemic granulation tissue with abundance of macrophages

Question: A 52-year-old-woman presents to an urgent care clinic with right upper quadrant pain for the past few hours. She admits to having similar episodes of pain in the past but milder than today. Past medical history is insignificant. She took an antacid, but it did not help. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F ), respirations are 16/min, pulse is 78/min, and blood pressure is 122/98 mm Hg. Physical examination is normal, and she says that her pain has subsided. The urgent care provider suspects she has cholecystitis, so she undergoes a limited abdominal ultrasound to confirm it. However, no evidence of cholecystitis is seen with ultrasound, but adenomyomatosis of the gallbladder is incidentally noted. The patient has no clinical features suspicious for malignancy. What is the next best step in the management of this patient? (A) Cholecystectomy (C) Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (D) Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (B) Barium swallow study (E) No further treatment required
Reason: The correct answer is (E) No further treatment required.

In this case, the patient has experienced episodes of right upper quadrant pain likely related to gallbladder issues, but the ultrasound has not confirmed acute cholecystitis and instead revealed adenomyomatosis, which is a benign condition. Since there are no findings consistent with malignancy or urgent pathology, and the patient's pain has subsided, it is appropriate to manage her conservatively without further intervention at this time.
Answer: (E) No further treatment required

Question: A 67-year-old man with a past medical history of poorly-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is brought to the emergency department for acute onset nausea and vomiting. According to the patient, he suddenly experienced vertigo and began vomiting 3 hours ago while watching TV. He reports hiking in New Hampshire with his wife 2 days ago. Past medical history is significant for a myocardial infarction (MI) that was treated with cardiac stenting, T2DM, and hypertension. Medications include lisinopril, aspirin, atorvastatin, warfarin, and insulin. Physical examination demonstrates left-sided facial droop and decreased pinprick sensation at the right arm and leg. What is the most likely etiology of this patient’s symptoms? (D) Labryrinthitis (E) Thrombotic stroke at the anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) (B) Embolic stroke at the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) (C) Hypoperfusion of the anterior spinal artery (ASA) (A) Early disseminated Lyme disease
Reason: The most likely etiology of this patient's symptoms is (E) Thrombotic stroke at the anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA). This conclusion is supported by the patient's acute onset of neurological symptoms, including vertigo, left-sided facial droop, and sensory deficits on the contralateral side, which are consistent with a stroke affecting the AICA territory. Additionally, his background of poorly controlled diabetes and cardiovascular risk factors increases his likelihood of experiencing a thrombotic event.

Question: A 37-year-old woman, gravida 4, para 3, at 35 weeks' gestation is admitted to the hospital in active labor. Her three children were delivered by Cesarean section. One hour after vaginal delivery, the placenta is not delivered. Manual separation of the placenta leads to profuse vaginal bleeding. Her pulse is 122/min and blood pressure is 90/67 mm Hg. A firm, nontender uterine fundus is palpated at the level of the umbilicus. Hemoglobin is 8.3 g/dL and platelet count is 220,000/mm3. Activated partial thromboplastin time and prothrombin time are within normal limits. Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's postpartum bleeding? (A) Impaired uterine contractions (B) Consumption of intravascular clotting factors (D) Rupture of the fetal vessels (C) Rupture of the uterine wall (E) Defective decidual layer of the placenta
Reason: The most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's postpartum bleeding is (E) Defective decidual layer of the placenta. This conclusion is supported by the patient's history of multiple Cesarean sections, which increases the risk of placental issues, including placenta accreta, where the placenta attaches too deeply into the uterine wall, potentially leading to retained placenta and subsequent bleeding. The additional symptoms of profuse vaginal bleeding following manual separation further indicate that a defective or abnormal attachment of the placenta could be the cause of the delayed delivery and hemorrhage.
Answer: (E) Defective decidual layer of the placenta

Question: A 52-year-old man presents with a 5-week history of multiple cutaneous ulcers on his left forearm and neck, which he first noticed after returning from a 2-month stay in rural Peru. He does not recall any trauma or arthropod bites. The lesions began as non-pruritic erythematous papules that became enlarged, ulcerated, and crusted. There is no history of fever or abdominal pain. He has been sexually active with a single partner since their marriage at 24 years of age. The physical examination reveals erythematous, crusted plaques with central ulceration and a raised border. There is no fluctuance, drainage, or sporotrichoid spread. A punch biopsy was performed, which revealed an ulcerated lesion with a mixed inflammatory infiltrate. Amastigotes within dermal macrophages are seen on Giemsa staining. What is the most likely diagnosis? (C) Ecthyma (E) Cutaneous tuberculosis (D) Syphilis (B) Cutaneous leishmaniasis (A) Histoplasmosis
Reason: Cutaneous leishmaniasis is characterized by the presence of ulcerative skin lesions, particularly following exposure in endemic areas, such as rural Peru, and is confirmed by the identification of amastigotes within dermal macrophages through biopsy. The absence of systemic symptoms and the lesion's description further align with this diagnosis, distinguishing it from other potential conditions.

Question: Researchers are investigating the mechanism of cell apoptosis and host defense in mice. They have observed that mice with certain gene deletions are not able to fight the induced viral infection. They identify a cell that is able to destroy target cells infected with viruses by exocytosis of granule contents, which induces the activation of caspases. Which type of cell is responsible for this process? (B) Neutrophils (A) Macrophages (D) CD4+ lymphocytes (C) CD8+ lymphocytes (E) Eosinophils
Reason: CD8+ lymphocytes, also known as cytotoxic T cells, are specialized in identifying and destroying virus-infected cells through the release of granules that contain perforin and granzymes, leading to apoptosis of the target cells. Their role in directly inducing caspase activation during the immune response makes them the primary cell type associated with this mechanism of defending against viral infections.

She has a 2-year history of osteoarthritis of both knees, for which she takes ibuprofen. She drinks 1–2 glasses of wine daily. She is lying supine with her knees drawn up and avoids any movement. Her temperature is 38.5°C (101.3°F), pulse is 112/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 115/70 mm Hg. Physical examination shows abdominal tenderness and guarding; bowel sounds are decreased. An x-ray of the chest is shown. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's current symptoms? (D) Gastroesophageal reflux disease (B) Acute pancreatitis (A) Perforated peptic ulcer (E) Cholecystolithiasis
" (C) Acute mesenteric ischemia
Reason: The presentation of severe abdominal pain, guarding, and a history of epigastric pain that improved with eating suggests a possible perforated peptic ulcer. The acute nature of her symptoms, along with signs of rigidity and fever, aligns with the complications of a perforated ulcer leading to peritonitis, which is a medical emergency.

Question: A 31-year-old female presents to the emergency room complaining of fever and difficulty breathing. She first noticed these symptoms 3 days prior to presentation. Her past medical history is notable for well-controlled asthma. She does not smoke and drinks alcohol socially. Upon further questioning, she reports that her urine is tea-colored when she wakes up but generally becomes more yellow and clear over the course of the day. Her temperature is 100.8°F (38.2°C), blood pressure is 135/90 mmHg, pulse is 115/min, and respirations are 20/min. Lung auscultation reveals rales at the right lung base. Laboratory analysis is shown below:

Hemoglobin: 9.4 g/dL
Hematocrit: 31%
Leukocyte count: 3,700 cells/mm^3 with normal differential
Platelet count: 110,000/mm^3
Reticulocyte count: 3%

A chest radiograph reveals consolidation in the right lung base and the patient is given oral antibiotics. Which of the following processes is likely impaired in this patient? (C) Erythrocyte cytoskeletal formation (A) Inactivation of C3 convertase (B) Inactivation of C5 convertase (E) Aminolevulinic acid metabolism (D) Nicotinamide dinucleotide phosphate metabolism
Reason: The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings suggest a problem with the immune response, particularly in relation to infections, evidenced by the recent fever and lung consolidation. The presence of tea-colored urine may indicate hemolysis or kidney involvement, which could correlate with an issue in complement system regulation, particularly inactivation of C3 convertase, thus leading to increased susceptibility to bacterial infections.

Question: A 52-year-old woman presents with decreased exercise tolerance and difficulty breathing on exertion and while sleeping at night. She says that she requires 2 pillows to sleep at night to alleviate her shortness of breath. These symptoms started 6 months ago and are gradually increasing in severity. She does not have any chronic health problems. She has smoked 15 cigarettes per day for the past 20 years and drinks alcohol occasionally. Vital signs include: blood pressure 110/70 mm Hg, temperature 36.7°C (98.0°F), and regular pulse 90/min. On physical examination, the first heart sound is loud, and there is a low pitched rumbling murmur best heard at the cardiac apex. This patient is at high risk of developing which of the following complications? (A) Infective endocarditis (B) Myocarditis (E) Left atrial myxoma (C) Cardiac arrhythmia (D) High-output heart failure
Reason: The patient’s symptoms and physical examination findings suggest she may have mitral stenosis, which can be characterized by a loud first heart sound and a low-pitched rumbling murmur at the cardiac apex. This condition is associated with the enlargement of the left atrium, which can lead to atrial fibrillation, a type of cardiac arrhythmia, especially in patients who present with exertional dyspnea and nocturnal shortness of breath, indicating potential congestive heart failure or pulmonary congestion.

Question: A 72-year-old man presents to the emergency department because of difficulty breathing and sharp chest pain. The chest pain increases in intensity with lying down, and it radiates to the scapular ridge. Approximately 3 weeks ago, he had an anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction, which was treated with intravenous alteplase. He was discharged home in a stable condition. Current vital signs include a temperature of 38.1 (100.5°F), blood pressure of 131/91 mm Hg, and pulse of 99/min. On examination, heart sounds are distant and a scratching sound is heard on the left sternal border. ECG reveals widespread concave ST elevations in the precordial leads and PR depressions in leads V2-V6. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient condition? (A) Myocarditis (B) Ventricular aneurysm (C) Recurrent infarction (D) Aortic dissection (E) Dressler’s syndrome
Reason: The patient's presentation, including difficulty breathing, sharp chest pain that worsens with lying down, fever, and the specific auscultatory findings of distant heart sounds and a scratching sound (pericardial friction rub), are consistent with pericarditis. Given that the patient had a recent myocardial infarction, the ST elevations and PR depressions on the ECG further support the diagnosis of Dressler's syndrome, which is an autoimmune response leading to post-myocardial infarction pericarditis that typically occurs several weeks after the initial event.

Question: A 25-year-old primigravida is admitted to the hospital at 35 weeks gestation after she was hit in the abdomen by her roommate. She complains of severe dizziness, abdominal pain, and uterine contractions. Her vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 90/50 mm Hg, heart rate 99/min, respiratory rate 20/min, and temperature 36.3℃ (97.3℉). The fetal heart rate is 138/min. On examination, the patient is somnolent. There is an ecchymoses on the left side of her abdomen. The uterus is tender and strong uterine contractions are palpable. The fundus is between the xiphoid process and umbilicus There are no vaginal or cervical lesions and no visible bleeding. The cervix is long and closed.
Which of the following findings would occur in this patient over time as her condition progresses? (B) Increase in fundal height (D) Appearance of a watery vaginal discharge (E) Prolapse and tenderness of the posterior cul-de-sac (A) Cessation of uterine contractions (C) Emergence of rebound tenderness
Reason: The patient is likely experiencing a placental abruption, given the history of abdominal trauma, dizziness, abdominal pain, and uterine contractions, along with the ecchymosis and tender uterus. As the condition progresses, an increase in fundal height may occur due to the accumulation of blood and fluid from the placental separation in the uterus, which can lead to swelling and further enlargement of the uterus.
Answer: (B) Increase in fundal height

[INFO] Opinion paths:
Path 1: To analyze this question, let’s break down the key components of the case:

1. **Patient Profile**: A 68-year-old man with a history of Alzheimer’s dementia, presenting with confusion, increased somnolence, frequent urination, and significant weight loss.

2. **Laboratory Findings**: 
   - Elevated calcium level (Ca2+: 12.2 mg/dL), indicating hypercalcemia.
   - Low parathyroid hormone (PTH: 8 pg/mL), which suggests a cause of hypercalcemia that is not due to primary hyperparathyroidism.

3. **Symptoms**: The symptoms of confusion and increased urination can be associated with hypercalcemia. The patient is also exhibiting signs of dehydration and possibly renal effects due to the hypercalcemia.

Given these findings, the most likely cause of this patient's hypercalcemia is malignancy (such as a malignancy-related hypercalcemia or possibly a paraneoplastic syndrome) or primary hyperparathyroidism. The acute symptoms of confusion and somnolence are likely due to the hypercalcemia.

For long-term management of hypercalcemia, especially if it is related to malignancy, the most appropriate choice among the options provided is:

**(C) Furosemide**: This diuretic can help promote calcium excretion in the urine and can be used in the management of hypercalcemia, particularly in patients who may require long-term management or prophylaxis against hypercalcemia.

Other options like alendronate and calcitonin are typically used in different contexts of hypercalcemia (e.g., osteoporosis or acute treatment), while teriparatide is used for osteoporosis and not for managing hypercalcemia.

Therefore, the best long-term prophylaxis for the cause of this patient’s acute symptoms is:

**Answer: (C) Furosemide**
Path 2: Let's analyze the case step by step. The patient is presenting with confusion, somnolence, increased urination, and weight loss. His laboratory results show hypercalcemia (Ca2+ of 12.2 mg/dL) and low parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels (8 pg/mL), which suggests that the hypercalcemia is likely due to a cause other than primary hyperparathyroidism, such as malignancy or possibly a parathyroid-related issue.

In this context, the acute symptoms of confusion and increased urination could be attributed to hypercalcemia, which can cause neurologic symptoms. 

For long-term management of hypercalcemia, especially if it's related to a malignancy or other condition that is causing elevated calcium levels, bisphosphonates like alendronate are often used as they help to inhibit bone resorption and thus lower serum calcium levels over time.

Considering the options provided:

(A) Alendronate - This is a bisphosphonate used for treating hypercalcemia.
(B) Calcitonin - This can lower calcium levels but is not typically used for long-term management.
(D) IV fluids - This is a short-term treatment for acute hypercalcemia but not a long-term prophylaxis.
(C) Furosemide - This can help in managing hypercalcemia but is not used as a long-term solution.
(E) Teriparatide - This is a form of parathyroid hormone used in osteoporosis, not for hypercalcemia.

Given this analysis, the best long-term prophylaxis for the cause of this patient’s acute symptoms (hypercalcemia) would be:

Answer: (A) Alendronate
Path 3: Let's analyze the clinical scenario step by step.

The patient presents with confusion, somnolence, and increased urination. His laboratory values show hypercalcemia (Ca2+ of 12.2 mg/dL) with a low parathyroid hormone (PTH) level (8 pg/mL). This suggests a condition causing hypercalcemia that is not due to primary hyperparathyroidism, and the most common cause of hypercalcemia with low PTH is malignancy (specifically, paraneoplastic syndromes) or other causes such as vitamin D intoxication.

Given these findings, the patient’s acute symptoms (confusion, somnolence, increased urination) are likely due to hypercalcemia. The best long-term prophylaxis for managing hypercalcemia, particularly if it is suspected to be due to malignancy, is to prevent further calcium release from bones.

Among the options presented:
- (A) Alendronate is a bisphosphonate that can help reduce bone resorption and is effective for hypercalcemia related to malignancy.
- (B) Calcitonin can lower calcium levels acutely but is not used for long-term management.
- (C) IV fluids are used for acute management of hypercalcemia but do not provide long-term prophylaxis.
- (D) Furosemide can help with symptomatic hypercalcemia but is not a long-term solution.
- (E) Teriparatide is a form of parathyroid hormone and would not be appropriate in this situation.

Based on this analysis, the best long-term prophylaxis for this patient's hypercalcemia is (A) Alendronate. 

Answer: (A) Alendronate
Path 4: Let's analyze the case step by step.

The patient is a 68-year-old man with confusion, increased somnolence, significant weight loss, and urination. The laboratory values show hypercalcemia (Ca2+ of 12.2 mg/dL) and low parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels (8 pg/mL). The combination of hypercalcemia and low PTH suggests primary hyperparathyroidism or malignancy-related hypercalcemia, but given the low PTH, primary hyperparathyroidism is less likely.

The most likely underlying cause of his hypercalcemia could be malignancy, potentially leading to paraneoplastic hypercalcemia (e.g., from squamous cell carcinoma) or a related condition. 

In terms of management, immediate treatment may include hydration and diuretics to promote calcium excretion, but for long-term prophylaxis to manage the hypercalcemia, the best choice is to reduce bone resorption.

Among the options provided:
- **Alendronate** (A) is a bisphosphonate that inhibits osteoclastic bone resorption and is effective for long-term management of hypercalcemia due to malignancy.
- **Calcitonin** (B) can decrease serum calcium levels but is typically used for short-term management.
- **IV fluids** (D) are supportive for hydration and help with calcium excretion but are not a long-term solution.
- **Furosemide** (C) may help with symptomatic hypercalcemia but does not address the underlying cause.
- **Teriparatide** (E) is a form of parathyroid hormone used for osteoporosis and would not be appropriate here.

Given this information, the best long-term prophylaxis for this patient's hypercalcemia would be:

**Answer: (A) Alendronate**.
Path 5: Let's analyze the details of the case step by step.

1. **Patient Presentation**: The patient is a 68-year-old man with confusion and increased somnolence. He has a significant weight loss and has been soiling his diapers with copious amounts of urine, which can indicate possible hypercalcemia (high calcium levels).

2. **Laboratory Values**: The key lab finding is a serum calcium level of 12.2 mg/dL, which is elevated (normal range is typically 8.5-10.5 mg/dL). The parathyroid hormone (PTH) level is low (8 pg/mL), indicating that this hypercalcemia is likely not due to primary hyperparathyroidism.

3. **Possible Diagnosis**: The combination of hypercalcemia and low PTH suggests that the patient may have a malignancy-related hypercalcemia or another cause of hypercalcemia that does not involve parathyroid hormone (such as vitamin D intoxication or malignancy).

4. **Long-term Management**: To manage the hypercalcemia, the best long-term prophylaxis would typically involve preventing further increases in calcium levels and addressing the underlying cause. Among the options given, alendronate (a bisphosphonate) is often used in cases of malignancy-related hypercalcemia and can help to reduce calcium levels by inhibiting bone resorption.

5. **Evaluating the Options**:
   - (A) **Alendronate**: A bisphosphonate that inhibits bone resorption and can be used for hypercalcemia, especially if due to malignancy.
   - (B) **Calcitonin**: Can also lower calcium levels but is not typically used for long-term management.
   - (C) **IV fluids**: Useful for immediate management of hypercalcemia but not a long-term solution.
   - (D) **Furosemide**: Can help excrete calcium but is not a first-line treatment for the cause of the hypercalcemia.
   - (E) **Teriparatide**: It is a form of parathyroid hormone used for osteoporosis, not for hypercalcemia.

Given this analysis, the best choice for long-term prophylaxis for this patient’s acute symptoms due to hypercalcemia is:

**Answer: (A) Alendronate**.
Path 6: Let's analyze the information step by step.

The patient presents with confusion, somnolence, and copious urination, alongside laboratory values indicating hypercalcemia (calcium level at 12.2 mg/dL) and low parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels (8 pg/mL). The low PTH suggests that the cause of hypercalcemia is likely not due to primary hyperparathyroidism, but rather another cause such as malignancy, vitamin D intoxication, or other conditions leading to hypercalcemia.

Given that the patient also has a significant weight loss of 15 pounds over three weeks, this raises suspicion for a malignancy that could be causing the hypercalcemia (e.g., paraneoplastic syndrome).

For long-term management of hypercalcemia, particularly if it is due to malignancy, the best option from the choices provided is often a bisphosphonate to inhibit bone resorption and help lower calcium levels.

Among the options given:
- (A) Alendronate is a bisphosphonate that can help manage hypercalcemia, particularly in cases associated with malignancy.
- (B) Calcitonin is used for acute treatment but is not suitable for long-term management.
- (C) IV fluids are important for acute management but not for long-term prophylaxis.
- (D) Furosemide can help with hypercalcemia but is not a primary long-term treatment.
- (E) Teriparatide is a form of PTH and would not be used in hypercalcemia.

Thus, the best long-term prophylaxis for this patient's hypercalcemia is:

**Answer: (A) Alendronate**
Path 7: Let's analyze the information provided step by step:

1. **Patient's Symptoms and History**: The patient is confused, somnolent, and has been experiencing increased urination and significant weight loss. He has a known history of Alzheimer's dementia.

2. **Laboratory Values**: 
   - Serum calcium (Ca2+) is elevated at 12.2 mg/dL (normal range is typically 8.5-10.5 mg/dL). 
   - Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is low at 8 pg/mL (normal range is typically 10-65 pg/mL).

3. **Interpretation of Values**: The combination of hypercalcemia (elevated calcium) and low PTH suggests that this patient may have primary hyperparathyroidism or a parathyroid-related disorder, but given the low PTH, it might also indicate a non-parathyroid cause for the hypercalcemia, such as malignancy or vitamin D excess.

4. **Clinical Presentation**: The confusion and somnolence can be attributed to hypercalcemia, which can cause neurological symptoms.

5. **Long-term Prophylaxis**: To address the hypercalcemia, we need to consider options that can help manage or prevent further increases in calcium levels.

Now, let's evaluate the options provided:
- **(A) Alendronate**: A bisphosphonate that can be used for osteoporosis and to lower high calcium levels in certain conditions, but it is not typically used for immediate or acute hypercalcemia.
- **(B) Calcitonin**: Can be used to lower serum calcium levels acutely but is not a long-term solution.
- **(C) IV fluids**: Important for acute management of hypercalcemia but not a long-term prophylaxis.
- **(D) Furosemide**: A diuretic that can help promote calcium excretion in cases of hypercalcemia but does not address the underlying cause.
- **(E) Teriparatide**: A synthetic form of parathyroid hormone used for osteoporosis. It is not suitable for managing hypercalcemia.

Given the options and the underlying cause of the acute symptoms (hypercalcemia), the best long-term prophylaxis to manage the hypercalcemia is:

**(A) Alendronate** 

**Final Answer**: (A) Alendronate
Path 8: Let's analyze the case step by step.

1. **Patient Presentation**: The 68-year-old man has confusion, increased somnolence, frequent urination, and significant weight loss. These symptoms can be indicative of hypercalcemia, especially given the elevated calcium level of 12.2 mg/dL.

2. **Lab Values**: The patient's calcium level is elevated, while parathyroid hormone (PTH) is low (8 pg/mL), suggesting a condition other than primary hyperparathyroidism. The elevated calcium with low PTH could indicate malignancy (e.g., paraneoplastic syndrome), vitamin D intoxication, or other causes of hypercalcemia.

3. **Symptoms of Hypercalcemia**: The symptoms of hypercalcemia can include confusion, lethargy, and increased urination due to osmotic diuresis.

4. **Long-term Management**: The goal is to manage his hypercalcemia. Among the options provided:
   - **(A) Alendronate**: This is a bisphosphonate used for osteoporosis and can help in cases of hypercalcemia related to malignancy.
   - **(B) Calcitonin**: This can lower calcium levels acutely but is not used for long-term management.
   - **(C) IV fluids**: While helpful for acute management, it is not a long-term solution.
   - **(D) Furosemide**: This can help with symptomatic hypercalcemia but is not a long-term prophylactic option.
   - **(E) Teriparatide**: This is a form of parathyroid hormone used for osteoporosis, not for hypercalcemia.

5. **Best Long-term Prophylaxis**: The best long-term prophylaxis for managing chronic hypercalcemia, especially if malignancy is involved, would be to prevent further increases in calcium levels, which is effectively done with bisphosphonates like alendronate.

Therefore, the best long-term prophylaxis for the cause of this patient’s acute symptoms is:

**Answer**: (A) Alendronate
Path 9: Let's analyze the situation step by step based on the provided information.

The patient is a 68-year-old man with confusion, increased urinary output, weight loss, and elevated serum calcium levels (12.2 mg/dL). The low parathyroid hormone (PTH) level (8 pg/mL) in the context of hypercalcemia suggests primary hyperparathyroidism or possibly malignancy-related hypercalcemia, but given the suppressed PTH, primary hyperparathyroidism is less likely.

The symptoms of confusion and increased urine output can be attributed to hypercalcemia, which can cause confusion and lethargy as well as polyuria due to its effects on renal function.

For long-term management of hypercalcemia, particularly if it is due to malignancy or primary hyperparathyroidism, the best option among the choices provided is to reduce the bone resorption that contributes to elevated calcium levels. 

- **Alendronate (A)** is a bisphosphonate that inhibits osteoclast activity and bone resorption, which would help lower serum calcium levels in conditions like hypercalcemia of malignancy or primary hyperparathyroidism.
- **Calcitonin (B)** is less commonly used for long-term management of hypercalcemia, as its effects are more acute and temporary.
- **IV fluids (D)** are useful for acute management but not for long-term prophylaxis.
- **Furosemide (C)** can help increase calcium excretion but is not a long-term solution.
- **Teriparatide (E)** is a form of parathyroid hormone used for osteoporosis treatment and would not be appropriate in this context.

Thus, the best long-term prophylaxis for this patient’s condition, considering the elevated calcium levels, would be:

**Answer: (A) Alendronate**
Path 10: Let's analyze the case step by step.

The patient is a 68-year-old man with confusion and increased somnolence, as well as a history of significant weight loss and increased urination. His laboratory results show hypercalcemia (elevated calcium level of 12.2 mg/dL) with a low parathyroid hormone (PTH) level (8 pg/mL). This suggests a condition of primary hyperparathyroidism or possibly malignancy-related hypercalcemia, as the low PTH indicates that the hypercalcemia is not due to increased secretion of PTH.

Given the acute symptoms of confusion, increased urinary output, and hypercalcemia, the best long-term management would focus on addressing the underlying cause of the hypercalcemia.

Among the options provided:

- **Alendronate (A)** is a bisphosphonate used to treat osteoporosis and to help lower high calcium levels, especially in cases related to malignancy.
- **Calcitonin (B)** can help lower calcium levels acutely but is not a long-term treatment.
- **IV fluids (D)** would be important for acute management of hypercalcemia but are not considered long-term prophylaxis.
- **Furosemide (C)** can help excrete calcium through the urine but is also not a long-term solution.
- **Teriparatide (E)** is a form of PTH used in osteoporosis treatment and would be inappropriate here since the PTH levels are already low.

Given this context, the best long-term prophylaxis for managing this patient’s acute symptoms due to hypercalcemia would be:

**Answer: (A) Alendronate** 

This choice addresses the underlying issue of hypercalcemia and provides a long-term strategy to manage calcium levels effectively.

Question: A 5-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother because he claims to have spoken to his recently-deceased grandfather. The grandfather, who lived with the family and frequently watched the boy for his parents, died 2 months ago. The boy was taken out of preschool for 3 days after his grandfather's death but has since returned. His teachers report that the boy is currently doing well, completing his assignments, and engaging in play with other children. When asked about how he feels, the boy becomes tearful and says, “I miss my grandpa. I sometimes talk to him when my mom is not around.” Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? (C) Normal grief (D) Schizophreniform disorder (A) Brief psychotic disorder (B) Adjustment disorder (E) Major depressive disorder
Reason: The most likely diagnosis is normal grief because the boy is expressing sadness and longing for his deceased grandfather, which is typical behavior in children experiencing loss. His ability to engage in normal activities, such as completing assignments and playing with peers, along with the transient nature of his grief symptoms, supports a diagnosis of normal grief rather than a psychiatric disorder.
Answer: (C) Normal grief

Question: A 41-year-old man with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia is brought to the emergency department by his wife for difficulty breathing after choking on food at dinner. He is unconscious and pulseless on arrival. Despite appropriate life-saving measures, he dies. Examination of the heart shows a necrotic, pale yellow plaque in the left circumflex artery. Similar lesions are most likely to be found in which of the following locations? (D) Internal carotid artery (C) Thoracic aorta (A) Superficial temporal artery (B) Abdominal aorta (E) Pulmonary artery
Reason: The most appropriate answer is (B) Abdominal aorta because a necrotic, pale yellow plaque indicates the presence of atherosclerosis, which commonly affects large and medium-sized arteries. The abdominal aorta, like the internal carotid artery, is known to develop significant atherosclerotic plaques due to similar risk factors such as hypertension and hyperlipidemia, which this patient has.
Answer: (B) Abdominal aorta

Question: A 51-year-old man presents to the emergency department with an episode of syncope. He was at a local farmer's market when he fainted while picking produce. He rapidly returned to his baseline mental status and did not hit his head. The patient has a past medical history of diabetes and hypertension but is not currently taking any medications. His temperature is 97.5°F (36.4°C), blood pressure is 173/101 mmHg, pulse is 82/min, respirations are 14/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for clear breath sounds and a S4 heart sound. Rectal exam reveals a firm and nodular prostate that is non-tender and a fecal-occult sample that is negative for blood. Which of the following is this patient's presentation most concerning for? (D) Prostate cancer (B) Normal physical exam (E) Prostatitis (C) Prostate abscess (A) Benign prostatic hyperplasia
Reason: The most concerning diagnosis in this patient's presentation is (D) Prostate cancer because his firm and nodular prostate on examination raises the suspicion for malignancy, particularly in a patient of his age and risk profile. Additionally, the presence of an S4 heart sound suggests possible underlying cardiovascular changes, which can be associated with chronic illness or malignancy, further emphasizing the need for further evaluation of the prostate findings.
Answer: (D) Prostate cancer

Question: A previously healthy 3-week-old infant is brought to the emergency department 6 hours after the onset of fever and persistent irritability. He had been well until 2 days ago, when he started feeding poorly and sleeping more than usual. He appears lethargic and irritable when roused for examination. His temperature is 39°C (102°F). He cries when he is picked up and when his neck is flexed. The remainder of the physical and neurological examinations show no other abnormalities. His serum glucose is 115 mg/mL. His total serum bilirubin is 6.3 mg/dL. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows:
Pressure 255 mm H2O
Erythrocytes 2/mm3
Leukocyte count 710/mm3
Segmented neutrophils 95%
Lymphocytes 5%
Protein 86 mg/dL
Glucose 22 mg/dL
Gram stain results of the cerebrospinal fluid are pending. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial antibiotic regimen for this patient?" (A) Ampicillin and ceftriaxone (E) Vancomycin, ampicillin, and doxycycline (D) Vancomycin, ampicillin, and cefotaxime (C) Ampicillin, gentamicin, and cefotaxime (B) Gentamicin and cefotaxime
Reason: The clinical presentation and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings of the infant suggest that he may have bacterial meningitis. Given his age and the high leukocyte count with a predominance of neutrophils, an appropriate initial antibiotic regimen would need to cover common pathogens such as Group B Streptococcus and Escherichia coli. The combination of ampicillin, gentamicin, and cefotaxime offers broad-spectrum coverage against these potential pathogens in a young infant.
Answer: (C) Ampicillin, gentamicin, and cefotaxime

Question: A 64-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department 30 minutes after the onset of right-sided weakness and impaired speech. On admission, she is diagnosed with thrombotic stroke and treatment with alteplase is begun. Neurologic examination four weeks later shows residual right hemiparesis. A CT scan of the head shows hypoattenuation in the territory of the left middle cerebral artery. Which of the following processes best explains this finding? (D) Caseous necrosis (B) Coagulative necrosis (A) Gangrenous necrosis (E) Fat necrosis (C) Liquefactive necrosis
Reason: The presence of hypoattenuation in the territory of the left middle cerebral artery on CT scan, combined with the clinical context of a thrombotic stroke, suggests that there has been an area of tissue death due to lack of blood flow. In the brain, ischemic injury typically leads to liquefactive necrosis, where the affected brain tissue becomes softened and turns into a liquid mass, often associated with the transformation of necrotic tissue into cystic spaces. This process is characteristic of infarctions in the central nervous system.
Answer: (C) Liquefactive necrosis

Fewshot exampler #3:
Question: A neurophysiology expert is teaching his students the physiology of the neuromuscular junction. While describing the sequence of events that takes place at the neuromuscular junction, he mentions that as the action potential travels down the motor neuron, it causes depolarization of the presynaptic membrane. This results in the opening of voltage-gated calcium channels, which leads to an influx of calcium into the synapse of the motor neuron. Consequently, the cytosolic concentration of Ca2+ ions increases. Which of the following occurs at the neuromuscular junction as a result of this increase in cytosolic Ca2+? (C) Increased Na+ and K+ conductance of the motor end plate (A) Release of Ca2+ ions into the synaptic cleft (B) Binding of Ca2+ ions to NM receptors (D) Exocytosis of acetylcholine from the synaptic vesicles (E) Generation of an end plate potential
Reason: The increase in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration in the presynaptic terminal of the motor neuron is a critical trigger for the release of neurotransmitters. Specifically, calcium ions facilitate the process of exocytosis, which allows synaptic vesicles containing acetylcholine to fuse with the presynaptic membrane and release their contents into the synaptic cleft, enabling communication with the muscle fiber.
Answer: (D) Exocytosis of acetylcholine from the synaptic vesicles

Question: A 1-week-old infant that was birthed at home is rushed to the emergency room by his parents. His parents are recent immigrants who do not speak English. Through a translator, the child's parents say that during play with the infant, the infant's body became rigid and his mouth 'locked up'. The child likely suffered from a(n): (C) Intrauterine infection (B) Infection of the colon (E) Dental infection (D) Infection of the umbilical stump (A) Infection of a foot ulcer
Reason: The reasoning behind the answer suggesting an infection of the umbilical stump relates to the infant's age, recent home birth, and the described symptoms. Infections of the umbilical stump can manifest in young infants as irritability, rigidity, or even more severe systemic symptoms, which aligns with the physical response described by the parents ("body became rigid" and "mouth locked up"). This type of infection can occur due to improper care of the umbilical stump after birth, making it a plausible diagnosis in this context.
Answer: (D) Infection of the umbilical stump

Question: A 24-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department by friends because of an episode of jerking movements of the whole body that lasted for one minute. She reports a 2-week history of fever, headache, and altered sensorium. Her fever ranges from 38.3°C (101.0°F) to 38.9°C (102.0°F). Her past medical history is significant for toothache and multiple dental caries. The patient denies any history of smoking or alcohol or drug use. She is not currently sexually active. Her vital signs include: blood pressure 110/74 mm Hg, pulse 124/min, respiratory rate 14/min, temperature 38.9°C (102.0°F). On physical examination, the patient is confused and disoriented. She is moving her right side more than her left. A noncontrast CT scan of the head reveals a ring-enhancing lesion in the left frontal lobe consistent with a cerebral abscess. The abscess is evacuated and sent for culture studies. Which of the following microorganisms did the culture most likely grow? (A) Actinomyces israelii (C) Pseudomonas aeruginosa (B) Escherichia coli (E) Streptococcus viridans (D) Staphylococcus aureus
Reason: The reasoning for the answer indicating Streptococcus viridans stems from the patient's dental history and the presentation of a cerebral abscess. Streptococcus viridans is commonly found in the oral cavity and is associated with dental infections; thus, it is a likely causative organism in cases where there is a history of dental caries leading to a brain abscess. The patient's symptoms of fever, headache, altered sensorium, and the presence of a ring-enhancing lesion support the association with a bacterial infection originating from dental sources.
Answer: (E) Streptococcus viridans

Her symptoms were preceded by tremors, palpitations, and diaphoresis. During the past 3 months, she has had increased appetite and has gained 6.8 kg (15 lbs). She has hypertension, hyperlipidemia, anxiety disorder, and gastroesophageal reflux. She works as a nurse in an ICU and has been under more stress than usual. She does not smoke. She drinks 5 glasses of wine every week. Current medications include enalapril, atorvastatin, fluoxetine, and omeprazole. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb); BMI is 36 kg/m2. Her temperature is 37°C (98.8°F), pulse is 78/min, and blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. The abdomen is soft and nontender. Fasting serum studies show:
Na+ 140 mEq/L
K+ 3.5 mEq/L
HCO3- 22 mEq/L
Creatinine 0.8 mg/dL
Glucose 37 mg/dL
Insulin 280 μU/mL (N=11–240)
Thyroid-stimulating hormone 2.8 μU/mL
C-peptide 4.9 ng/mL (N=0.8–3.1)
Urine screen for sulfonylurea is negative. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?" (E) Cushing's syndrome
" (A) Polycystic ovarian syndrome (C) Exogenous hypoglycemia (B) Insulinoma (D) Binge eating disorder
Reason: The reasoning for the diagnosis of insulinoma is supported by the patient's symptoms of lightheadedness, weakness, and the significant hypoglycemia (glucose level of 37 mg/dL) observed in her fasting serum studies. Additionally, the elevated insulin (280 μU/mL) and C-peptide levels (4.9 ng/mL) indicate inappropriate insulin secretion, which is characteristic of insulinoma, especially given her symptoms, which suggest episodes of hypoglycemia likely related to excessive insulin production.

Question: A 55-year-old woman comes to the physician because of involuntary hand movements that improve with alcohol consumption. Physical examination shows bilateral hand tremors that worsen when the patient is asked to extend her arms out in front of her. The physician prescribes a medication that is associated with an increased risk of bronchospasms. This drug has which of the following immediate effects on the cardiovascular system?
 $$$ Stroke volume %%% Heart rate %%% Peripheral vascular resistance $$$ (A) ↑ ↑ ↓ (E) ↑ ↑ ↑ (C) ↓ ↑ ↑ (B) ↓ ↓ ↓ (D) ↓ ↓ ↑
Reason: The answer is (D) ↓ ↓ ↑ because the medication likely prescribed is a beta-blocker. Beta-blockers typically reduce heart rate and stroke volume by decreasing the cardiac output, while they can increase peripheral vascular resistance due to unopposed alpha receptor activity when beta-adrenergic activity is blocked. This matches the patient's profile and the effect of the medication on the cardiovascular system.
Answer: (D) ↓ ↓ ↑

Which of the following is the most likely origin of this patient's hematuria?" (E) Urinary bladder
" (D) Urethra (B) Ureter (C) Renal pelvis (A) Renal glomeruli
Reason: The answer is (D) Urethra because the described presentation of hematuria that begins at the start of urination and clears by the end of the stream typically indicates a source of bleeding near the urethra. In contrast, bleeding from the kidneys or urinary tract would generally result in blood being mixed throughout the entire urine stream. This pattern, along with the absence of any significant urinary infection or other abnormalities, points to the urethra as the most likely source of the hematuria.

Urinalysis is notable for bacteruria without pyuria or nitrates. Physical exam is notable for a confused woman who is unable to answer questions appropriately. She states she has no pain or symptoms and is not sure why she is here. She thinks the year is 1982. Which of the following complications could be seen with treatment of this patient? (B) Central nervous system infection (D) Diarrhea and flora destruction (A) Autoimmune pontine demyelination (C) Cerebral edema (E) Osmotic demyelination
Reason: The answer is (E) Osmotic demyelination because the patient is presenting with severe hyponatremia (low sodium levels), which can significantly increase the risk for complications during treatment. Specifically, if sodium is corrected too rapidly, it can lead to osmotic demyelination syndrome, a serious neurological condition characterized by damage to myelin in the central nervous system. This occurs due to rapid shifts in fluid and electrolytes, particularly in patients with chronic hyponatremia, and is a well-known risk in the management of such electrolyte imbalances.

Question: A 31-year-old woman presents to her primary care provider to discuss the results from a previous urine analysis. She has no new complaints and feels well. Past medical history is significant for systemic lupus erythematosus. She was diagnosed 5 years ago and takes hydroxychloroquine every day and prednisone when her condition flares. Her previous urine analysis shows elevated protein levels (4+) and blood (3+). The urine sediment contained red blood cells (6 RBCs/high-power field). The treating physician would like to perform a renal biopsy to rule out lupus nephritis. What type of hypersensitivity is suggestive of lupus nephritis? (B) Type II, mediated by CD4+ T cells (D) Type III, mediated by IgG antibodies (E) Type IV, mediated by IgG and IgM antibodies (C) Type I, mediated by IgE antibodies (A) Type IV, mediated by CD4+ T cells
Reason: Lupus nephritis is primarily associated with Type III hypersensitivity, which involves the formation of immune complexes that deposit in tissues, leading to inflammation and damage. In systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), antibodies (specifically IgG antibodies) form complexes with self-antigens, and their accumulation in the kidneys can precipitate the symptoms observed, such as proteinuria and hematuria.
Answer: (D) Type III, mediated by IgG antibodies

Question: A 69-year-old man with history of coronary artery disease necessitating angioplasty and stent placement presents to the ED due to fever, chills, and productive cough for one day. He is started on levofloxacin and admitted because of his comorbidity and observed tachypnea of 35 breaths per minute. He is continued on his home medications including aspirin, clopidogrel, metoprolol, and lisinopril. He cannot ambulate as frequently as he would like due to his immediate dependence on oxygen. What intervention should be provided for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis in this patient while hospitalized? (E) Low molecular weight heparin (C) Aspirin and clopidogrel are sufficient (D) Warfarin (B) Clopidogrel is sufficient; hold aspirin (A) Aspirin is sufficient; hold clopidogrel
Reason: Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is the standard prophylactic treatment for deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in hospitalized patients, especially those at increased risk due to reduced mobility and comorbidities. Given this patient's dependence on oxygen and limitations in ambulation, LMWH provides effective prophylaxis against DVT, reducing the likelihood of thrombotic complications during his hospital stay.

Question: A 45-year-old woman gravida 1, para 1, comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of a right breast lump and a 4.5-kg (10-lb) weight loss. She has not had any breast pain or nipple discharge. She had right breast mastitis 10 years ago while breastfeeding but has no other history of serious illness. Palpation of the right breast shows a 3-cm firm mass with well-defined margins lateral to the right nipple . There is dimpling of the overlying skin but no rash. The left breast is normal. A mammogram shows a density with calcifications in a star-shaped formation in the same location of the mass. Histological examination of a biopsy specimen from the breast mass is most likely to show which of the following? (B) Disorganized nests of glandular cells with surrounding fibrosis (C) Large, pink-staining cells in the epidermis (E) Infiltration of ductal cells blocking the dermal lymphatics (D) Orderly rows of monomorphic cells that do not stain with E-cadherin (A) Dilated ducts lined with neoplastic cells and necrotic centers
Reason: The most likely histological finding for this patient's breast mass is (B) disorganized nests of glandular cells with surrounding fibrosis, which is characteristic of invasive ductal carcinoma. The presentation of a firm mass, skin dimpling, and the presence of calcifications on the mammogram suggest a malignancy, and invasive ductal carcinoma typically shows disorganized cellular arrangements along with desmoplastic (fibrotic) changes in the surrounding tissue.
Answer: (B) Disorganized nests of glandular cells with surrounding fibrosis

Question: The study is performed in an attempt to determine whether there is an association between maternal exposure to 2nd-hand smoke and low birth weight. A total of 1,000 women who have given birth to at least 1 child are placed into 1 of 2 groups according to the birth weight of their 1st child. Each group includes 500 women whose 1st child either weighed < 2,500 g (5.5 lb) or > 2,500 g (5.5 lb). In the 1st group, 250 subjects admitted to living with or being in close proximity to a smoker. In the 2nd group, 50 subjects admitted to living with or being in close proximity to a smoker. Which of the following is the strongest measure of association that can be calculated from this study? (B) Relative risk (A) Odds ratio (D) Absolute risk (E) Risk difference (C) Rate ratio
Reason: The strongest measure of association that can be calculated from this study is (A) odds ratio. Since the study design groups women based on the outcome of interest (birth weight) and retrospectively assesses exposure (2nd-hand smoke), the odds ratio is appropriate for comparing the odds of exposure in the two different outcome groups.
Answer: (A) Odds ratio

Question: A 26-year-old woman presents to her gynecologist with complaints of pain with her menses and during intercourse. She also complains of chest pain that occurs whenever she has her menstrual period. The patient has a past medical history of bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder. Her current medications include lithium and haloperidol. Review of systems is notable only for pain when she has a bowel movement relieved by defecation. Her temperature is 98.2°F (36.8°C), blood pressure is 114/74 mmHg, pulse is 70/min, respirations are 14/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Pelvic exam is notable for a tender adnexal mass. The patient's uterus is soft, boggy, and tender. Which of the following is the most appropriate method of confirming the diagnosis in this patient? (E) Transvaginal ultrasound (C) Laparoscopy (A) Clinical diagnosis (B) Endometrial biopsy (D) MRI
Reason: In this case, the symptoms and pelvic exam findings suggest the presence of an adnexal mass, which could be indicative of conditions such as ovarian cysts, endometriosis, or other pelvic pathologies. Laparoscopy is often considered the gold standard for directly visualizing and potentially treating intra-abdominal or pelvic conditions, allowing for definitive diagnosis when non-invasive imaging methods may not provide conclusive information.

Question: A 40-year-old male is brought into the emergency department as the unrestrained passenger in a motor vehicle collision. On presentation he is obtunded with multiple ecchymoses on his chest and abdomen. There is marked distortion of his left lower extremity. His blood pressure is 90/64 mmHg, pulse is 130/min, and respirations are 24/min. Physical exam is limited by the patient’s mental state. The patient appears to be in pain while breathing and has tenderness to palpation of the abdomen. Neck veins are distended. Auscultation of the lungs reveals absent breath sounds on the left and hyperresonance to percussion. An emergent procedure is done and the patient improves. Had a chest radiograph of the patient been obtained on presentation to the ED, which of the following findings would most likely have been seen? (E) Tracheal deviation to the right (B) Bilateral fluffy infiltrates at the lung bases (D) Tracheal deviation to the left (C) Collection of fluid in the left lung base (A) Consolidation of the left lower lobe
Reason: In this scenario, the presence of absent breath sounds on the left and hyperresonance to percussion suggests the likelihood of a tension pneumothorax on the left side. This condition can cause a shift of the mediastinum and trachea towards the opposite side (in this case, to the right) as the accumulated air compresses the lung and structures within the thoracic cavity, hence supporting the answer of tracheal deviation to the right.
Answer: (E) Tracheal deviation to the right

Question: A 3-year-old girl with cystic fibrosis is brought to the physician for a follow-up examination. Her mother has noticed that the child has had multiple falls over the past 4 months while walking, especially in the evening. Her current medications include pancreatic enzyme supplements, an albuterol inhaler, and acetylcysteine. She is at the 10th percentile for height and the 5th percentile for weight. Examination shows dry skin, and cone shaped elevated papules on the trunk and extremities. There is an irregularly shaped foamy gray patch on the left conjunctiva. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? (C) Administer vitamin A (B) Administer zinc (E) Administer lutein (A) Administer niacin (D) Administer riboflavin
Reason: In this case, the child's symptoms, including multiple falls and the presence of cone-shaped elevated papules, suggest possible vitamin A deficiency, which can lead to issues such as night blindness and skin problems. Given that cystic fibrosis patients often have malabsorption due to pancreatic insufficiency, they are at risk for deficiencies in fat-soluble vitamins like vitamin A, making vitamin A supplementation the most appropriate next step in management.
Answer: (C) Administer vitamin A

Question: A 54-year-old woman appears in your office for a new patient visit. She reports a past medical history of hypertension, which she was told was related to "adrenal gland disease." You recall that Conn syndrome and pheochromocytomas are both conditions affecting the adrenal gland that result in hypertension by different mechanisms. Which areas of the adrenal gland are involved in Conn syndrome and pheochromocytomas, respectively? (E) Zona fasciculata; zona reticularis (B) Zona fasciculata; medulla (C) Zona glomerulosa; medulla (A) Zona glomerulosa; zona fasciculata (D) Medulla; zona reticularis
Reason: Conn syndrome, also known as primary hyperaldosteronism, results from excessive production of aldosterone by the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex, leading to hypertension. In contrast, pheochromocytomas arise from the adrenal medulla and secrete catecholamines, which also contribute to elevated blood pressure through different physiological pathways.

Question: A 68-year-old man presents to his primary care physician for a routine checkup. He currently has no complaints. During routine blood work, he is found to have a slightly elevated calcium (10.4 mg/dL) and some findings of plasma cells in his peripheral blood smear (less than 10%). His physician orders a serum protein electrophoresis which demonstrates a slight increase in gamma protein that is found to be light chain predominate. What is the most likely complication for this patient as this disease progresses if left untreated? (B) Kidney damage (C) Raynaud's phenomenon (D) Splenomegaly (E) Hepatomegaly (A) Peripheral neuropathy
Reason: The presence of elevated calcium levels, along with findings of plasma cells and an increase in gamma proteins, suggests a diagnosis of multiple myeloma or a related plasma cell disorder. As this disease progresses, one of the common complications is kidney damage due to the impact of excessive light chains (Bence Jones proteins) on renal function, which can lead to kidney injury and potential failure if left untreated.

Question: A 64-hour-old baby girl is being evaluated for discharge. She was born by forceps-assisted vaginal delivery at 39 weeks gestation. The mother has no chronic medical conditions and attended all her prenatal visits. The mother’s blood type is A+. On day 1, the patient was noted to have a scalp laceration. Breastfeeding was difficult at first but quickly improved upon nurse assistance. The patient has had adequate wet diapers since birth. Upon physical examination, the resident notes the infant has scleral icterus and jaundiced skin. The scalp laceration noted on day 1 is intact without fluctuance or surrounding erythema. When the infant is slightly lifted from the bed and released, she spread out her arms, pulls them in, and exhibits a strong cry. Labs are drawn as shown below:

Blood type: AB-
Total bilirubin 8.7 mg/dL
Direct bilirubin 0.5 mg/dL

Six hours later, repeat total bilirubin is 8.3 mg/dL. Which of the following is the next best step in the management of the baby’s condition? (D) Observation (B) Exchange transfusion (A) Coombs test (C) Switch to baby formula (E) Phototherapy
Reason: In this scenario, the infant demonstrates mild hyperbilirubinemia with a total bilirubin of 8.7 mg/dL that has even slightly decreased to 8.3 mg/dL in the following hours, indicating that the bilirubin levels are stable and not rising significantly. Given that the jaundice is mild and that the infant is otherwise well (e.g., feeding adequately, stable vital signs, and normal activity), the appropriate management is observation rather than immediate intervention, as significant intervention such as phototherapy or exchange transfusion would not be warranted at this level of bilirubin.

Question: A 16-year-old girl with celiac disease is brought to the physician because of a 1-week history of generalized weakness and tingling around her mouth and in her fingertips. She also complains of abdominal cramps and nausea. In addition to following a gluten-free diet, she has been following a vegan diet for the past 2 years. Physical examination shows involuntary contractions of the muscle at the corner of her mouth and nose that are elicited by tapping on her right cheek. Her parathyroid hormone concentration is 834 pg/mL. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause for this patient's current condition? (E) Autoimmune-mediated destruction of parathyroid tissue (B) Decreased levels of renal 1α-hydroxylase (D) Decreased intestinal absorption of ergocalciferol (A) Decreased conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to cholecalciferol (C) Decreased dietary intake of ergocalciferol
Reason: The answer is (D) Decreased intestinal absorption of ergocalciferol. This 16-year-old girl's symptoms, including weakness, tingling, and muscle contractions, along with her history of celiac disease, suggest malabsorption issues. Celiac disease can lead to decreased absorption of various nutrients, including vitamins, so it's likely that her vegetarian diet and impaired absorption are contributing to her deficiency in ergocalciferol (vitamin D), leading to secondary hyperparathyroidism as indicated by her high parathyroid hormone levels.

Question: A 33-year-old man presents with yellowing of the eyes. He says symptoms onset acutely 3 days ago and have not improved. He says he has had similar episodes for the past 10 years. Each episode is self-limited, lasting no more than 3–5 days. The patient denies any recent history of nausea, weight loss, abdominal pain, light-colored stools, dark urine, or pruritus. Current medications are herbal supplements and a multivitamin. The patient is afebrile and vital signs are within normal limits. His BMI is 32 kg/m2. Physical exam is unremarkable. Laboratory findings are significant for the following:
Total bilirubin 3 mg/dL
Direct bilirubin 0.2 mg/dL
AST/ALT/Alkaline phosphatase Normal
Hematocrit/lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)/haptoglobin Normal
Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient? (E) Gilbert’s syndrome (B) Crigler-Najjar syndrome type 1 (A) Medication-induced hemolysis (D) Cholelithiasis (C) Dubin-Johnson syndrome
Reason: The answer is (E) Gilbert’s syndrome. This patient's presentation of intermittent mild jaundice with normal liver enzymes, low direct bilirubin, and the absence of symptoms typically associated with liver or hemolytic disorders suggest a benign condition like Gilbert's syndrome, which is characterized by transient episodes of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia due to reduced hepatic bilirubin uptake. His history of recurrent episodes over many years without complications further supports this diagnosis.

Question: A 64-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician complaining of difficulty maintaining her balance while walking. Her husband comes along to the appointment with her, because he feels that she has not been acting herself at home lately. After further questioning him, it is noted that she has recently been voiding urine unintentionally at inappropriate times. If there is suspicion for an intracranial process, what would most likely be seen on MRI and what is the treatment? (B) Constricted ventricles; surgical resection (D) Dilated ventricles; surgical resection (E) Constricted ventricles; watch and wait (A) Constricted ventricles; ventricular shunt (C) Dilated ventricles; ventricular shunt
Reason: The answer is (C) Dilated ventricles; ventricular shunt. The symptoms of balance difficulties and urinary incontinence in this 64-year-old woman suggest normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), which is characterized by enlarged ventricles on MRI due to the accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid despite normal intracranial pressure. The standard treatment for NPH is the placement of a ventricular shunt to alleviate the symptoms by draining excess cerebrospinal fluid.
Answer: (C) Dilated ventricles; ventricular shunt

Question: A 57-year-old florist presents to his family physician with nodular lesions on his right hand and forearm. He explains that he got pricked by a rose thorn on his right "pointer finger" where the first lesions appeared, and the other lesions then began to appear in an ascending manner. The physician prescribed a medication and warned him of gynecomastia as a side effect if taken for long periods of time. Which of the following is the mechanism of action of the medication? (A) Inhibits ergosterol synthesis (B) Binds to ergosterol, forming destructive pores in cell membrane (E) Disrupts microtubule function (D) Inhibits formation of beta glucan (C) Inhibits squalene epoxidase
Reason: The answer is (A) Inhibits ergosterol synthesis. This supports the notion that the patient is likely experiencing a fungal infection, as the presence of nodular lesions following a thorn prick suggests a possible cutaneous mycosis. The medication prescribed, which may lead to gynecomastia, is often linked to antifungal agents like azoles that hinder the synthesis of ergosterol, an essential component of fungal cell membranes.

Question: A 4-year-old boy is brought to the pediatrician by his mother for a routine medical examination. His medical history is relevant for delayed gross motor milestones. The mother is concerned about a growth delay because both of his brothers were twice his size at this age. Physical examination reveals a well-groomed and healthy boy with a prominent forehead and short stature, in addition to shortened upper and lower extremities with a normal vertebral column. The patient’s vitals reveal: temperature 36.5°C (97.6°F); pulse 60/min; and respiratory rate 17/min and a normal intelligence quotient (IQ). A mutation in which of the following genes is the most likely cause underlying the patient’s condition? (E) Runt-related transcription factor 2 (D) Insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (B) Fibrillin-1 (A) Alpha-1 type I collagen (C) Fibroblast growth factor receptor 3
Reason: The answer is (C) Fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3). This child's symptoms, including short stature with disproportionately shortened extremities, and a prominent forehead, are characteristic of achondroplasia, a common cause of dwarfism caused by mutations in the FGFR3 gene, leading to abnormal cartilage formation and bone growth. The normal IQ in this case also aligns with typical presentation in achondroplasia, further supporting this genetic link.

Question: A 9-year-old boy from Eritrea is admitted to the hospital for lethargy and increased work of breathing. He has had recurrent episodes of fever, shortness of breath, and fatigue in the past 3 years. His pulse is 132/min and blood pressure is 90/66 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 82%. Auscultation of the chest shows coarse crackles in both lungs and a diastolic murmur at the cardiac apex. Despite appropriate lifesaving measures, he dies. A photomicrograph of a section of myocardium obtained at autopsy is shown. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's cardiac disease? (A) Amastigote infiltration (D) Type II hypersensitivity reaction (E) Exotoxin-mediated myonecrosis (C) Non-caseating granulomatous inflammation (B) Beta-myosin heavy chain defect
Reason: The answer is (D) Type II hypersensitivity reaction. The clinical presentation of recurrent fevers, dyspnea, and the observed diastolic murmur suggest a possible autoimmune heart condition, where the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy heart tissue, a hallmark of type II hypersensitivity. Additionally, the patient's background and symptoms might be consistent with rheumatic heart disease or another type of inflammatory cardiomyopathy linked to autoimmunity, further supporting this answer.
Answer: (D) Type II hypersensitivity reaction

[INFO] Opinion paths:
Path 1: Let's analyze the situation step by step.

The infant is one week old and has jaundice, which is common in newborns. Since the infant is breastfeeding well and the mother reports that the baby sleeps well and cries only a few times a day, we're likely dealing with physiological jaundice, which is common in newborns and typically resolves as the infant matures.

Given that this infant is breastfeeding and doing well, the best treatment option for managing the jaundice is to continue breastfeeding, as this is generally sufficient for most cases of physiological jaundice. 

However, if the jaundice were to become severe or prolonged, other interventions might be necessary, such as phototherapy.

In this case, since the infant is feeding well and the jaundice is likely physiological, the best answer is:

Answer: (E) Continue normal breast feeding.
Path 2: Let's analyze the situation step by step.

1. **Infant's Age and Condition**: The infant is one week old and presents with jaundice (yellow skin), which is common in newborns, especially within the first week of life.

2. **Feeding and Behavior**: The infant is breastfeeding well and appears to be feeding adequately, along with normal sleep patterns.

3. **Possible Causes of Jaundice**: In a breastfed infant, jaundice can be due to several reasons, including:
   - Physiologic neonatal jaundice (most common)
   - Breast milk jaundice (which can occur later)
   - Hemolytic disease (less likely given the context)

4. **Management of Jaundice**: In cases of physiologic jaundice, the jaundice typically resolves on its own without requiring aggressive treatment. However, phototherapy is often used if the bilirubin levels are significant enough to pose a risk of kernicterus.

5. **Options Analysis**:
   - **(E) Continue normal breast feeding**: This is generally recommended for physiologic jaundice unless bilirubin levels are critically high.
   - **(D) Switch from breast milk to formula**: This is not typically necessary unless there are concerns about breastfeeding adequacy.
   - **(C) Plasma exchange**: This is a more aggressive treatment typically reserved for severe cases, such as hemolytic disease.
   - **(B) Phenobarbital administration**: This is sometimes used in cases of breast milk jaundice but is not a primary treatment for routine jaundice.
   - **(A) Phototherapy**: This is a common treatment for significant jaundice to help lower bilirubin levels.

Given that the infant is breastfeeding well and the jaundice is likely physiologic, the best initial treatment for management is to continue breastfeeding but also consider phototherapy if the bilirubin levels warrant it.

Therefore, the most appropriate answer, considering the context provided, is:

**Answer: (A) Phototherapy** (if bilirubin levels are high enough). However, if levels are not critically high and the infant is breastfeeding well, **(E) Continue normal breast feeding** could also be a reasonable approach. The context suggests that phototherapy is the most appropriate treatment if needed.
Path 3: To determine the best treatment for the infant's jaundice, we should consider a few key details:

1. The infant is one week old and has jaundice, which is common in newborns due to physiological neonatal jaundice or breastfeeding jaundice.
2. The infant is feeding well and exclusively breastfed, which is important as breastfeeding can sometimes lead to jaundice if the infant is not feeding adequately.
3. The infant is crying several times a day and sleeping well at night, which suggests no significant distress or other complications.

Given these factors, the most likely cause of jaundice in this case is physiological neonatal jaundice or possibly breastfeeding jaundice, where the bilirubin levels can be elevated due to the breakdown of fetal red blood cells.

The best initial treatment for physiological jaundice in a well-feeding infant is usually to continue breastfeeding while monitoring bilirubin levels. Phototherapy is often used for higher levels of bilirubin that pose a risk of kernicterus, but if the jaundice is mild and the infant is feeding well, continuing breastfeeding is an appropriate approach.

Therefore, the best treatment for this condition, considering the options provided, is:

**Answer: (E) Continue normal breast feeding**
Path 4: Let's analyze the case step by step.

The infant is one week old and presents with jaundice, which is a common condition in newborns. Since the infant is breastfeeding exclusively and appears to be feeding well, we need to consider the likely causes of jaundice in this age group.

1. **Physiological Jaundice**: This is common in newborns and typically resolves on its own without treatment. It usually appears after 24 hours of life, peaks at around 3-5 days, and resolves by 1-2 weeks. 

2. **Breastfeeding Jaundice**: This can occur if the infant is not feeding well or if there is insufficient breast milk intake leading to dehydration and increased bilirubin levels. However, the mother reports that the infant is feeding well.

3. **Breast Milk Jaundice**: This type occurs later (usually after the first week) and is due to factors in the breast milk that inhibit the excretion of bilirubin.

In this case, since the infant is a one-week-old, well-fed baby with jaundice, the most likely cause is breast milk jaundice, which is common and usually resolves without intervention.

Given these considerations, the best treatment option for this condition is:

**(E) Continue normal breast feeding** 

This option supports the natural resolution of breast milk jaundice without unnecessary interventions. 

Answer: (E) Continue normal breast feeding.
Path 5: Let's analyze the information given step by step. 

The infant is one week old and presents with jaundice, which is a common condition in newborns. Jaundice in infants is often due to physiological neonatal jaundice, which occurs as a result of the immature liver's inability to process bilirubin effectively. This type of jaundice typically resolves on its own.

However, given that the infant is exclusively breastfeeding and is noted to be crying several times a day but feeding well, we should consider the possibility of breastfeeding jaundice, which can occur due to inadequate breastfeeding leading to dehydration and reduced bilirubin elimination. 

In cases of neonatal jaundice, phototherapy is the most common and effective treatment to lower bilirubin levels, especially if they are elevated. Phototherapy helps to break down bilirubin in the skin, making it easier for the liver to excrete.

Given these considerations, the best treatment for this infant's jaundice is:

Answer: (A) Phototherapy.
Path 6: Let's analyze the information provided step by step.

1. **Patient Profile**: A one-week-old full-term infant.
2. **Chief Complaint**: The mother reports jaundice (yellow skin) in her daughter.
3. **Feeding**: The infant is breastfeeding exclusively and the mother feels the infant is feeding well.
4. **Crying and Sleeping**: The infant cries several times a day and sleeps 7-8 hours at night, uninterrupted.

**Assessment**:
- Jaundice in a newborn can be common, particularly in the first week of life. 
- The timing of jaundice is important: physiological jaundice typically appears after the first 24 hours of life and peaks around day 3 to 5, resolving by 1-2 weeks.
- Given that the infant is breastfeeding and appears to be feeding well, it suggests that this may be a case of physiological jaundice or breastfeeding jaundice, rather than pathological jaundice due to hemolysis or other serious conditions.

**Treatment Options**:
- (E) **Continue normal breastfeeding**: Encouraged in cases of breastfeeding jaundice.
- (D) **Switch from breast milk to formula**: Not typically necessary unless there are concerns about breastfeeding adequacy.
- (C) **Plasma exchange**: Reserved for severe cases of hemolytic disease or very high bilirubin levels.
- (B) **Phenobarbital administration**: Generally not a first-line treatment for jaundice.
- (A) **Phototherapy**: Often used in cases of significant hyperbilirubinemia to lower bilirubin levels.

Given that the infant is at one week old with jaundice and is breastfeeding well, the best initial management approach would be to continue breastfeeding while monitoring the infant.

Therefore, the best treatment for this condition is: 

**Answer**: (E) Continue normal breast feeding.
Path 7: Let's analyze the scenario step by step.

1. **Infant's Condition**: The infant is one week old and has jaundice, which is common in newborns. It's important to determine whether the jaundice is physiological or pathological. 

2. **Feeding**: The mother reports that the infant is breastfeeding exclusively and feeding well. This is relevant because exclusive breastfeeding can lead to breastfeeding jaundice, particularly if the baby is not feeding effectively and not getting enough caloric intake.

3. **Age of Onset**: Newborn jaundice typically appears within the first week of life. Physiological jaundice usually peaks around 3-5 days of life and resolves by two weeks.

4. **Symptoms**: The infant is crying several times a day but is also sleeping well at night for longer stretches, suggesting that the baby is not in distress from hunger or dehydration.

5. **Treatment Options**:
   - **(E) Continue normal breastfeeding**: This is important, especially if the jaundice is due to breastfeeding, as continuing to feed can help resolve it.
   - **(D) Switch from breast milk to formula**: This is usually not necessary unless there is concern for dehydration or inadequate intake.
   - **(C) Plasma exchange**: This is reserved for severe cases of hemolytic disease or other serious conditions causing jaundice.
   - **(B) Phenobarbital administration**: This is used in specific cases of jaundice related to bilirubin metabolism issues but is not first-line treatment.
   - **(A) Phototherapy**: This is the standard treatment for significant hyperbilirubinemia in newborns. However, the case does not suggest severe jaundice requiring immediate intervention.

Given that this infant is likely experiencing physiological jaundice, and considering the mother's report of good feeding, the best immediate approach would be to continue normal breastfeeding. This allows for adequate caloric intake, which can help resolve the jaundice.

Answer: (E) Continue normal breastfeeding.
Path 8: Let's analyze the situation step by step. 

The infant is one week old and is presenting with jaundice. It's important to consider the likely causes of jaundice in a newborn. In the first week of life, physiological jaundice is common due to the immature liver's ability to process bilirubin. Since the mother reports that the infant has been feeding well and is exclusively breastfed, we should also consider the possibility of breast milk jaundice, which can occur later in the first week of life but is usually not severe.

However, given the age of the infant (one week) and the fact that there is jaundice, the most appropriate initial management for mild jaundice is to ensure continued normal breastfeeding, as this can help with hydration and bilirubin elimination.

Considering these points, the best treatment for this condition, assuming there are no other concerning clinical signs or significant hyperbilirubinemia requiring intervention, would be:

Answer: (E) Continue normal breastfeeding.
Path 9: To analyze this case step by step:

1. **Identify the condition**: The infant is one week old and is presenting with jaundice (yellowing of the skin). In newborns, jaundice is often due to physiological neonatal jaundice caused by an elevated level of unconjugated bilirubin.

2. **Consider the age of the infant**: At one week, physiological jaundice is common and typically resolves on its own. However, if the jaundice is significant or prolonged, it may require treatment.

3. **Feeding status**: The mother reports that the infant is breastfeeding exclusively and feeding well. Breastfeeding jaundice can occur in some infants but is typically related to inadequate feeding, which does not appear to be the case here.

4. **Best treatment option**: In cases of significant jaundice (which can be evaluated by bilirubin levels), phototherapy is often the first-line treatment to help reduce bilirubin levels. It is safe and effective in newborns.

5. **Evaluate the options**:
   - (E) Continue normal breastfeeding: This is generally safe if the infant is feeding well and there are no signs of dehydration.
   - (D) Switch from breast milk to formula: This is not necessary if the infant is feeding well and gaining weight.
   - (C) Plasma exchange: This is typically reserved for severe cases of hyperbilirubinemia and is not the first-line treatment.
   - (B) Phenobarbital administration: This can be used in some cases of hyperbilirubinemia but is not the standard treatment for physiological jaundice.
   - (A) Phototherapy: This is the best treatment for significant jaundice in a newborn.

Based on this analysis, the best treatment for this condition is:

**Answer: (A) Phototherapy**
Path 10: To approach this question, we first need to analyze the scenario presented:

- The infant is one week old and exhibits jaundice (yellowing of the skin).
- The mother reports that the infant is breastfeeding exclusively and appears to be feeding well.
- The infant's jaundice is likely due to physiological neonatal jaundice, which is common in the first week of life, especially in breastfed infants.

Now, let's consider the potential treatments listed in the options:

(A) **Phototherapy**: This is commonly used to treat significant jaundice in newborns, especially when bilirubin levels rise to concerning levels. It helps to lower bilirubin levels by breaking it down in the skin.

(B) **Phenobarbital administration**: This is sometimes used in cases of severe hyperbilirubinemia but is not the first-line treatment for typical neonatal jaundice.

(C) **Plasma exchange**: This is reserved for severe cases of hyperbilirubinemia that do not respond to phototherapy and is not appropriate for a typical case of neonatal jaundice.

(D) **Switch from breast milk to formula**: This is not generally indicated unless the jaundice is due to breastfeeding difficulties, which doesn't seem to be the case here as the infant is feeding well.

(E) **Continue normal breast feeding**: Continuing to breastfeed is important, but if the jaundice is significant, it may not be sufficient by itself.

The best treatment for significant neonatal jaundice, particularly if it is rising or concerning, is typically **(A) Phototherapy**. This light treatment is effective and safe for lowering bilirubin levels in infants.

Therefore, the best treatment for this condition is:

**Answer: (A) Phototherapy**
[INFO] Final decision by majority voting
To determine the most consistent answer based on the majority voting from the provided paths, we can summarize the responses:

- **Path 1**: (E) Continue normal breast feeding.
- **Path 2**: (A) Phototherapy (if bilirubin levels are high enough), but also mentions (E) Continue normal breast feeding.
- **Path 3**: (E) Continue normal breast feeding.
- **Path 4**: (E) Continue normal breast feeding.
- **Path 5**: (A) Phototherapy.
- **Path 6**: (E) Continue normal breast feeding.
- **Path 7**: (E) Continue normal breastfeeding.
- **Path 8**: (E) Continue normal breastfeeding.
- **Path 9**: (A) Phototherapy.
- **Path 10**: (A) Phototherapy.

Now, let's count the votes for each option:

- **(A) Phototherapy**: 4 votes (Paths 2, 5, 9, 10)
- **(E) Continue normal breast feeding**: 6 votes (Paths 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8)

Based on the majority voting, the most consistent answer is:

**Answer: (E) Continue normal breast feeding.** 

This reflects the consensus that, given the infant is one week old, breastfeeding well, and likely experiencing physiological jaundice, continuing normal breastfeeding is the appropriate management approach.

Question: A 26-year-old gravida 1 at 36 weeks gestation is brought to the emergency department by her husband complaining of contractions lasting up to 2 minutes. The contractions are mostly in the front of her abdomen and do not radiate. The frequency and intensity of contractions have not changed since the onset. The patient worries that she is in labor. The blood pressure is 125/80 mm Hg, the heart rate is 96/min, the respiratory rate is 15/min, and the temperature 36.8°C (98.2℉). The physical examination is unremarkable. The estimated fetal weight is 3200 g (6.6 lb). The fetal heart rate is 146/min. The cervix is not dilated. The vertex is at the -4 station. Which of the following would be proper short-term management of this woman? (D) Manage with terbutaline (B) Perform an ultrasound examination (E) Admit to the Obstetrics Department for observation (C) Reassurance, hydration, and ambulation (A) Admit to the Obstetrics Department in preparation for labor induction
Reason: The answer is (C) Reassurance, hydration, and ambulation because the patient's symptoms indicate that she is likely experiencing Braxton Hicks contractions, which are common in late pregnancy. Since the cervix is not dilated and the contractions have not changed in intensity or frequency, supportive measures such as reassurance and hydration are appropriate while allowing the woman to remain active and comfortable.
Answer: (C) Reassurance, hydration, and ambulation

Question: A 71-year-old man comes to the physician for a health maintenance examination. Aside from occasional lower back pain in the last couple of years, he feels well. He had a right-sided myocardial infarction 4 years ago. Currently, he has no shortness of breath and has no anginal symptoms. He has a 30 pack-year history of smoking but stopped smoking 10 years ago and does not drink alcohol. His pulse is 59/min, and his blood pressure is 135/75 mm Hg. Physical examination reveals 1+ lower extremity edema. Cardiac and pulmonary auscultation show no abnormalities. There is no lymphadenopathy. His laboratory studies show a hemoglobin of 13.2 g/dL and serum protein of 10.1 g/dL. ECG shows known Q wave abnormalities unchanged since the last ECG one year ago. A serum protein electrophoresis with immunofixation is shown. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step to establish the diagnosis? (B) Rectal biopsy (D) Whole-body CT scan (C) Echocardiography (A) Bone densitometry (E) Urine dipstick
"
Reason: The answer is (D) Whole-body CT scan because the patient’s presentation, including a history of smoking and previous myocardial infarction, combined with the lab findings, raises the suspicion for possible malignancy or other systemic issues. A whole-body CT scan can help identify any underlying tumors or conditions that may explain the elevated serum protein and support the diagnostic process.
Answer: (D) Whole-body CT scan

Question: A 7-year-old boy presents with difficult left eye-opening in the morning, eye discharge, and irritation. These symptoms developed gradually over the past week. He attends a primary school where recently an outbreak of tonsillitis took place. He had otitis media 2 weeks ago treated with ampicillin. At the presentation, the patient’s vital signs are within normal limits. Eye examination reveals bulbar conjunctival injection, mild eyelid edema, and a moderate mucopurulent discharge with crusts on the lower eyelid. There is no corneal or eyelid ulceration. No lymphadenopathy is noted. Which of the following investigations should be performed to establish a diagnosis before the treatment? (C) Rapid viral test (E) Polymerase chain reaction (B) No investigations are required in this case (D) Scrapings with Gram staining (A) Bacterial culture of the discharge
Reason: The answer is (B) No investigations are required in this case because the clinical signs and symptoms presented by the boy, including conjunctival injection, eyelid edema, and mucopurulent discharge, strongly indicate a bacterial conjunctivitis that is consistent enough for a diagnosis based on physical examination alone. In children with typical presentations, empiric treatment can commonly be initiated without further testing, especially given the outbreak of similar infections in the community.
Answer: (B) No investigations are required in this case

Question: A 43-year-old woman presents to her primary care provider with shortness of breath. She reports a 4-month history of progressively worsening difficulty breathing with associated occasional chest pain. She is a long-distance runner but has had trouble running recently due to her breathing difficulties. Her past medical history is notable for well-controlled hypertension for which she takes hydrochlorothiazide. She had a tibial osteosarcoma lesion with pulmonary metastases as a child and successfully underwent chemotherapy and surgical resection. She has a 10 pack-year smoking history but quit 15 years ago. She drinks a glass of wine 3 times per week. Her temperature is 98.6°F (37°C), blood pressure is 140/85 mmHg, pulse is 82/min, and respirations are 18/min. On exam, she has increased work of breathing with a normal S1 and loud P2. An echocardiogram in this patient would most likely reveal which of the following? (D) Left ventricular hypertrophy with a bicuspid aortic valve (B) Left atrial dilatation with mitral valve stenosis (A) Biventricular dilatation with a decreased ejection fraction (C) Left ventricular dilatation with an incompetent aortic valve (E) Right ventricular hypertrophy with a dilated pulmonary artery
Reason: The clinical presentation of progressive shortness of breath, associated chest pain, and increased work of breathing, along with the notable examination finding of a loud P2, suggest pulmonary hypertension. The loud P2 indicates elevated pressures in the pulmonary artery, which can lead to right ventricular hypertrophy as the right ventricle works harder to pump against the increased resistance. Therefore, an echocardiogram in this context is most likely to reveal right ventricular hypertrophy with a dilated pulmonary artery.
Answer: (E) Right ventricular hypertrophy with a dilated pulmonary artery

Question: A 39-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department following a stab wound to the neck. Per the patient, she was walking her dog when she got robbed and was subsequently stabbed with a knife. Vitals are stable. Strength examination reveals 2/5 right-sided elbow flexion and extension, wrist extension, and finger motions. Babinski sign is upward-going on the right. There is decreased sensation to light touch and vibration on the patient's right side up to her shoulder. She also reports decreased sensation to pinprick and temperature on her left side, including her lower extremities, posterior forearm, and middle finger. The patient's right pupil is 2 mm smaller than the left with drooping of the right upper eyelid. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the patient’s presentation? (E) Syringomyelia (A) Anterior cord syndrome (C) Hemisection injury (B) Central cord syndrome (D) Posterior cord syndrome
Reason: The patient's clinical presentation, characterized by right-sided weakness and sensory loss (including vibration and light touch) along with left-sided loss of pinprick and temperature sensation, is indicative of a hemisection injury, commonly known as Brown-Séquard syndrome. This condition results from damage to one side of the spinal cord, leading to ipsilateral motor and proprioceptive deficits and contralateral loss of pain and temperature sensation due to the crossing fibers. The combination of these symptoms strongly supports the diagnosis of a hemisection injury.
Answer: (C) Hemisection injury

Question: A previously healthy 44-year-old man comes to his physician because of frequent urination and increased thirst for several weeks. Physical examination shows darkened skin and a firm mass in the right upper quadrant. His blood glucose is 220 mg/dL. A photomicrograph of a specimen obtained on liver biopsy is shown. Which of the following best describes the pathogenesis of the disease process in this patient? (B) Absence of β-globin synthesis (A) Upregulation of erythropoietin production (D) Defective transferrin receptor binding (C) Absence of a serine protease inhibitor (E) Defective serum copper transportation
Reason: The patient's presentation, including frequent urination, increased thirst, darkened skin, and a firm mass in the right upper quadrant, along with elevated blood glucose suggests a condition such as hemochromatosis or another disorder related to iron metabolism. The option "Defective transferrin receptor binding" relates to the impaired regulation of iron transport in conditions of excessive iron accumulation, which correlates with the skin changes and potential liver pathology seen in hemochromatosis. Thus, the defective binding of transferrin and resultant issues in iron metabolism represents an important aspect of the pathogenesis in this patient's likely underlying condition.
Answer: (D) Defective transferrin receptor binding

Question: A 22-year-old man presents with multiple, target-like skin lesions on his right and left upper and lower limbs. He says that the lesions appeared 4 days ago and that, over the last 24 hours, they have extended to his torso. Past medical history is significant for pruritus and pain on the left border of his lower lip 1 week ago, followed by the development of an oral ulcerative lesion. On physical examination, multiple round erythematous papules with a central blister, a pale ring of edema surrounding a dark red inflammatory zone, and an erythematous halo are noted. Mucosal surfaces are free of any ulcerative and exudative lesions. Which of the following statements best explains the pathogenesis underlying this patient’s condition? (D) IgA deposition in the papillary dermis (C) Circulating anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies (B) Circulating anti-desmoglein antibodies (A) Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha production by CD4+ T cells in the skin (E) Interferon (IFN) gamma production by CD4+ T cells in the skin
Reason: The patient's presentation, including the target-like lesions and prior oral ulcerative lesion, suggests an immune-mediated condition, likely erythema multiforme, which is associated with infections or drug reactions. The involvement of CD4+ T cells and the inflammatory response characterized by IFN-gamma production aligns with the immune activation seen in such skin manifestations.
Answer: (E) Interferon (IFN) gamma production by CD4+ T cells in the skin

Question: A 5-year-old boy is brought in by his parents for recurrent abdominal pain. The child has been taken out of class 5 times this past week for abdominal pain that resulted in him being sent home. The mother reports that her son's stools have remained unchanged during this time and are brown in color, without blood, and with normal consistency and scent. She also notes that while at home he seems to be his usual self and does not complain of any symptoms. Of note she presents to you that she has been preparing her son's lunches which consist of couscous, vegetables, fried rice, and chicken. The patient denies difficulty with producing stool and does not complain of any functional pain. The child's vitals and labs including BMP and CBC are unremarkable and within normal limits. An abdominal exam is performed and there is no tenderness upon palpation, and the abdomen is soft and non-distended. After a conversation with the child exploring his symptoms, which of the following is the next step in management for this child? (A) Increase oral hydration and fiber intake (E) Begin cognitive behavioral therapy (C) Perform a stool culture (D) Begin treatment with ciprofloxacin (B) Check the stool for fecal red blood cells and leukocytes
Reason: The child's recurrent abdominal pain appears to be occurring primarily at school and resolves at home, suggesting it is likely related to psychological or situational stress rather than an underlying medical condition. Since the child does not exhibit any physical symptoms during examinations, cognitive behavioral therapy can help address any anxiety or distress that may be contributing to his abdominal pain episodes.
Answer: (E) Begin cognitive behavioral therapy

Question: A 28-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after being struck by a car an hour ago as he was crossing the street. He did not lose consciousness. He is complaining of pain in his right arm, forehead, and pelvis. He also has the urge to urinate, but has been unable to do so since the accident. He takes no medications. His temperature is 37.1°C (98.9°F), pulse is 72/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 118/82 mm Hg. There are abrasions over his scalp and face and a 1x3 cm area of ecchymosis above his right eye. Abdominal examination shows suprapubic tenderness. There is a scant amount of blood at the urethral meatus. There is no cervical spinal tenderness. Musculoskeletal examination shows tenderness and ecchymosis over his right distal forearm. An x-ray of the pelvis shows a fracture of the pelvic ramus. A CT scan of the head and neck show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the best next step in the management of this patient? (D) Foley catheterization (B) IV pyelogram (E) Retroperitoneal ultrasound (A) Retrograde urethrogram (C) Contrast-enhanced CT scan of the abdomen
Reason: The presence of blood at the urethral meatus, combined with the mechanism of injury from being struck by a car, raises concern for a possible urethral injury. Conducting a retrograde urethrogram is the appropriate next step, as it allows for assessment of the integrity of the urethra before any catheterization, thus preventing further injury.
Answer: (A) Retrograde urethrogram

Question: A 42-year-old man comes to his primary care physician complaining of abdominal pain. He describes intermittent, burning, epigastric pain over the past 4 months. He reports that the pain worsens following meals. He had an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy done 2 months ago that showed a gastric ulcer without evidence of malignancy. The patient was prescribed pantoprazole with minimal improvement in symptoms. He denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or melena. The patient has no other medical problems. He had a total knee replacement 3 years ago following a motor vehicle accident for which he took naproxen for 2 months for pain management. He has smoked 1 pack per day since the age 22 and drinks 1-2 beers several nights a week with dinner. He works as a truck driver, and his diet consists of mostly of fast food. His family history is notable for hypertension in his paternal grandfather and coronary artery disease in his mother. On physical examination, the abdomen is soft, nondistended, and mildly tender in the mid-epigastric region. A stool test is positive for Helicobacter pylori antigen. In addition to antibiotic therapy, which of the following is the most likely to decrease the recurrence of the patient’s symptoms? (A) Celecoxib (E) Smoking cessation (C) Low-fat diet (D) Octreotide (B) Increase milk consumption
Reason: Smoking cessation is crucial in decreasing the recurrence of symptoms related to gastric ulcers because smoking impairs the gastric mucosal defense mechanisms and promotes ulcer formation and healing delay. Moreover, the positive Helicobacter pylori test indicates that an eradication strategy along with smoking cessation can significantly improve healing and reduce the risk of recurrence in this patient.

Question: A 3-year-old boy is brought to the physician for a well-child examination. He has had multiple falls while walking and running for the past 4 months. He used to be able to climb stairs independently but now requires assistance. He started speaking in 2-word sentences at 2 years of age. He is at the 50th percentile for height and the 60th percentile for weight. Examination shows a waddling gait and enlargement of bilateral calves. Muscle strength is decreased in the bilateral lower extremities. Patellar and ankle reflexes are 1+ bilaterally. To rise from a sitting position, he uses his hands to support himself to an upright position. Diagnosis is confirmed by a muscle biopsy and immunohistochemistry. Which of the following is most likely responsible for the most severe clinical presentation of this disease? (D) Splice site mutation (C) Missense mutation (A) Same sense mutation (E) Frameshift mutation (B) Silent mutation
Reason: The most likely responsible mutation for the most severe clinical presentation of this disease is a frameshift mutation (E). Frameshift mutations often result in a significant alteration of the protein coding sequence, leading to prematurely truncated proteins or completely nonfunctional proteins, which can cause more severe symptoms than other types of mutations, such as missense or silent mutations. In the context of a muscle disorder, such as muscular dystrophy, this could directly correlate with the observed severe clinical manifestations in the patient.
Answer: (E) Frameshift mutation

Question: A 76-year-old woman presents to the primary care physician for a regular check-up. History reveals that she has had episodes of mild urinary incontinence over the past 2 years precipitated by sneezing or laughing. However, over the past week, her urinary incontinence has occurred during regular activities. Her blood pressure is 140/90 mm Hg, heart rate is 86/min, respiratory rate is 22/min, and temperature is 37.7°C (99.9°F). Physical examination is remarkable for suprapubic tenderness. Urinalysis reveals 15 WBCs/HPF, positive nitrites, and positive leukocyte esterase. Which of the following is the best next step for this patient? (E) Reassurance (B) Cystoscopy (C) Urine culture (A) Ultrasound scan of the kidneys, urinary tract, and bladder (D) Pelvic floor muscle training
Reason: The answer is (C) Urine culture. Given the patient's symptoms of urinary incontinence, suprapubic tenderness, and the findings on urinalysis showing elevated white blood cells, positive nitrites, and positive leukocyte esterase, these suggest a urinary tract infection (UTI). A urine culture is the best next step to confirm the diagnosis and guide appropriate antibiotic therapy.

Question: A 48-year-old man, with a history of gluten intolerance, presents to the emergency department with persistent vomiting and diarrhea, and no fever. He recently returned from a vacation in Central America. He describes his diarrhea as profuse and almost clear. On physical examination, his skin turgor is decreased and his blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg. He is administered a saline solution and admitted for further examination and observation. What shifts are expected to be seen in this patient’s Darrow-Yannet diagram before the administration of saline? (E) Decreased extracellular volume and intracellular volume with a rise in osmolality (B) Increased extracellular volume, increased osmolarity, and decreased intracellular volume (D) Increased extracellular volume with no change in osmolarity or intracellular volume (C) Decreased extracellular volume with no change in osmolarity (A) Decreased extracellular volume and osmolality with an increased intracellular volume
Reason: The answer is (C) Decreased extracellular volume with no change in osmolality. In this patient experiencing persistent vomiting and diarrhea, there is a significant loss of extracellular fluid, leading to dehydration and decreased blood pressure, which is reflected by decreased extracellular volume. However, since the patient is not exhibiting any signs of hyperosmolarity—such as confusion or altered mental status—his serum osmolality is likely to remain normal initially, resulting in a decrease in extracellular volume without a corresponding change in osmolality.
Answer: (C) Decreased extracellular volume with no change in osmolarity

Question: A study is conducted to investigate the relationship between the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus and the use of atypical antipsychotic medications in patients with schizophrenia. 300 patients who received the atypical antipsychotic clozapine and 300 patients who received the typical antipsychotic haloperidol in long-acting injectable form were followed for 2 years. At the end of the observation period, the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus was compared between the two groups. Receipt of clozapine was found to be associated with an increased risk of diabetes mellitus relative to haloperidol (RR = 1.43, 95% p<0.01).
Developed type 2 diabetes mellitus Did not develop type 2 diabetes mellitus
Clozapine 30 270
Haloperidol 21 279
Based on these results, what proportion of patients receiving clozapine would not have been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus if they had been taking a typical antipsychotic?" (A) 33.3 (D) 1.48 (C) 0.03 (E) 0.43 (B) 0.3
Reason: To support the answer of (C) 0.03, we can analyze the data. Among the 300 patients on clozapine, 270 did not develop type 2 diabetes, which means that the proportion of patients who would not have been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes if they had taken a typical antipsychotic can be calculated as follows: 270 out of 300 patients, which equals 0.9 or 90%. The correct number to report as not developing diabetes is derived from the others who did, which leads to a misinterpretation in calculations pointing to the final answer being incorrectly noted.
Answer: (C) 0.03

Question: A previously healthy 35-year-old woman comes to the physician because of palpitations and anxiety for the past 2 months. She has had a 3.1-kg (7-lb) weight loss in this period. Her pulse is 112/min. Cardiac examination shows normal heart sounds with a regular rhythm. Neurologic examination shows a fine resting tremor of the hands; patellar reflexes are 3+ bilaterally with a shortened relaxation phase. Urine pregnancy test is negative. Which of the following sets of laboratory values is most likely on evaluation of blood obtained before treatment?
 $$$ TSH %%% free T4 %%% free T3 %%% Thyroxine-binding globulin $$$ (A) ↓ ↓ ↓ normal (D) ↑ ↓ ↓ ↓ (E) ↑ normal normal normal (C) ↓ ↑ normal ↑ (B) ↓ ↑ ↑ normal
Reason: To support the answer of (B) ↓ ↑ ↑ normal, we can analyze the clinical features presented, which suggest hyperthyroidism. In this condition, free T4 and free T3 levels are typically elevated due to increased production by the thyroid gland, while TSH is suppressed due to negative feedback mechanisms from the elevated thyroid hormones. Additionally, thyroxine-binding globulin levels would remain normal as there is no indication of increased binding capacity necessary in hyperthyroid states. This combination of lab values aligns with the symptoms of palpitations, anxiety, weight loss, and tremors exhibited by the patient.
Answer: (B) ↓ ↑ ↑ normal

Question: A 26-year-old nulligravid woman presents to her gynecologist after noticing a lump in her right breast while showering. She states that she first noticed the lump approximately 2 weeks ago, when the mass was slightly tender to touch. Since then, the lump has gotten slightly smaller and is now non-tender. The patient is otherwise healthy. She does not take oral contraceptives. Her last menses was approximately 2 weeks ago. There is no family history of cancer. On exam, the patient's temperature is 98.3°F (36.8°C), blood pressure is 116/84 mmHg, pulse is 65/min, and respirations are 12/min. In her right breast, there is a small 1.5 cm mass that is mobile, well-circumscribed, and firm. Which of the following is most likely on histological examination of the mass? (E) Terminal duct lobular units surrounded by dense stroma (A) Cysts with “leaf-like” projections (C) Hypercellular stroma with overgrowth of fibrous and glandular tissues (B) Dilated glands with 2 cell layers present (D) Large, pleomorphic cells with associated central necrosis and microcalcifications
Reason: To support the answer of (C) Hypercellular stroma with overgrowth of fibrous and glandular tissues, we can consider the characteristics of the breast mass described in the vignette. The patient is a young woman with a mobile, well-circumscribed mass that is firm and has not changed significantly over time, which is consistent with a benign breast condition often seen in younger women, such as a fibroadenoma. Histologically, fibroadenomas are characterized by excess stromal tissue along with glandular components, resulting in the hypercellular stroma described in the answer choice, making it the most likely finding in this case.
Answer: (C) Hypercellular stroma with overgrowth of fibrous and glandular tissues

Question: A 62-year-old woman presents to her oncologist to discuss the chemotherapy options for her newly diagnosed breast cancer. During the meeting, they discuss a drug that inhibits the breakdown of mitotic spindles in cells. Her oncologist explains that this will be more toxic to cancer cells because those cells are dividing more rapidly. Which of the following side effects is closely associated with the use of this chemotherapeutic agent? (C) Peripheral neuropathy (B) Paralytic ileus (D) Photosensitivity (E) Pulmonary fibrosis (A) Hemorrhagic cystitis
Reason: The correct answer is (C) Peripheral neuropathy. This side effect is commonly associated with certain chemotherapeutic agents, particularly those that disrupt microtubule dynamics, such as taxanes and vinca alkaloids. These drugs can affect the peripheral nerves, leading to symptoms such as numbness, tingling, and pain, which are characteristic of peripheral neuropathy.
Answer: (C) Peripheral neuropathy

Question: A 27-year-old female has a history of periodic bloody diarrhea over several years. Colonoscopy shows sigmoid colon inflammation, and the patient complains of joint pain in her knees and ankles. You suspect inflammatory bowel disease. Which of the following would suggest a diagnosis of Crohn disease: (C) Loss of large bowel haustra (E) Perianal fistula (A) Left lower quadrant pain (D) Mucosal and submucosal ulcerations (B) Jaundice
Reason: The correct answer is (E) Perianal fistula. The presence of a perianal fistula is a common complication associated with Crohn's disease, as this condition can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract and is known for causing transmural inflammation, leading to fistula formation. This finding can help differentiate Crohn's disease from ulcerative colitis, which typically does not present with such fistulas.
Answer: (E) Perianal fistula

Question: A 52-year-old man presents to his primary care physician complaining of a blistering rash in his inguinal region. Upon further questioning, he also endorses an unintended weight loss, diarrhea, polydipsia, and polyuria. A fingerstick glucose test shows elevated glucose even though this patient has no previous history of diabetes. After referral to an endocrinologist, the patient is found to have elevated serum glucagon and is diagnosed with glucagonoma. Which of the following is a function of glucagon? (C) Decreased glycogenolysis (A) Inhibition of insulin release (B) Increased glycolysis (E) Decreased ketone body producttion (D) Increased lipolysis
Reason: The correct answer is (D) Increased lipolysis. Glucagon plays a crucial role in promoting the breakdown of stored fat (lipolysis) in adipose tissue, which raises free fatty acid levels in the bloodstream that can be used as an energy source, especially during fasting or low glucose availability. This action is part of glucagon's overall function to increase blood glucose levels by mobilizing energy stores in response to low blood sugar.
Answer: (D) Increased lipolysis

Question: A 33-year-old man comes to the physician for evaluation of progressive hair loss from his scalp. He first noticed receding of the hairline over the bitemporal regions of his scalp 5 years ago. Since then, his hair has gradually become thinner over the crown of his head. He is otherwise healthy and takes no medications. Examination shows diffuse, nonscarring hair loss over the scalp with a bitemporal pattern of recession. Administration of which of the following drugs is most appropriate to treat this patient's hair loss? (D) Levothyroxine (E) Finasteride (A) Flutamide (B) Clomipramine (C) Triamcinolone
Reason: The most appropriate treatment for this patient's progressive hair loss is finasteride, as he is likely experiencing androgenetic alopecia, which responds well to this medication. Finasteride works by inhibiting the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a hormone that contributes to hair follicle miniaturization and hair loss in genetically predisposed individuals.
Answer: (E) Finasteride

Question: A 52-year-old woman presents with involuntary passage of urine and occasional watery vaginal discharge. She associates the onset of these symptoms with her discharge from the hospital for an abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy for endometrial carcinoma and a left ovary cyst 2 months ago. The incontinence occurs during both day and night and is not related to physical exertion. She denies urgency, incomplete voiding, painful urination, or any other genitourinary symptoms. She is currently on hormone replacement therapy. Her vital signs are as follows: blood pressure, 120/80 mm Hg; heart rate, 77/min; respiratory rate, 13/min; and temperature, 36.6℃ (97.9℉). On physical examination, there is no costovertebral or suprapubic tenderness. The surgical scar is normal in appearance. The gynecologic examination revealed a small opening in the upper portion of the anterior wall of the vagina. No discharge was noted. How would you confirm the diagnosis? (A) Transabdominal ultrasound (E) Urine flow test (D) Antegrade pyelography (C) Voiding cystourethrography (B) Cystometry
Reason: The diagnosis can be confirmed with voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) because the patient's symptoms, including involuntary urinary leakage and the presence of a small opening in the anterior vaginal wall, suggest a potential fistula (such as a vesicovaginal fistula) following her recent surgery. VCUG allows for the assessment of the bladder and urethra during urination, helping to identify any abnormal connections between the bladder and vagina.
Answer: (C) Voiding cystourethrography

[INFO] Opinion paths:
Path 1: Let's analyze the case step by step.

1. **Symptoms and History**: The patient presents with headaches, palpitations, and diaphoresis, which are suggestive of catecholamine excess often seen in conditions like pheochromocytoma. She has a history of hypertension, diffuse thyroid swelling (goiter), and bone pain.

2. **Vital Signs**: Her pulse is elevated at 116/min, and her blood pressure is significantly high at 196/102 mm Hg, which aligns with catecholamine excess.

3. **Physical Examination**: The presence of diffuse firm thyromegaly suggests possible thyroid disease, particularly hyperthyroidism, which can occur in conditions like Graves' disease.

4. **Laboratory Findings**: The elevated 24-hour urinary VMA (vanillylmandelic acid) and metanephrines point towards a pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma. Additionally, the elevated serum epinephrine indicates catecholamine production. The presence of hypercalcemia and elevated calcitonin suggests possible medullary thyroid carcinoma, which is associated with MEN 2A and MEN 2B syndromes. 

5. **Diagnosis Options**:
   - **MEN 2A**: Characterized by medullary thyroid carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, and primary hyperparathyroidism. 
   - **MEN 2B**: Similar to MEN 2A but includes mucosal neuromas and marfanoid habitus. 
   - **MEN 1**: Involves pituitary tumors, pancreatic endocrine tumors, and hyperparathyroidism, which does not match this case.
   - **Neurofibromatosis**: Not related to these symptoms.
   - **Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome**: Typically involves hemangioblastomas and is not characterized by the symptoms presented.

Given the combination of thyroid disease, pheochromocytoma (elevated catecholamines), and medullary thyroid carcinoma (hypercalcemia and elevated calcitonin), the most likely diagnosis is **Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia (MEN) 2B**.

**Final Answer**: (D) Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 2B
Path 2: Let's analyze the clinical presentation step by step.

1. **Symptoms**: The patient is experiencing headaches, palpitations, diaphoresis, anxiety, and bone pain, which can be associated with conditions affecting the endocrine system, particularly those leading to excess catecholamines or other hormones.

2. **Physical Exam**: The presence of diffuse thyromegaly (enlarged thyroid gland) and signs of hyperactivity (such as moist skin and fine tremors) suggests hyperthyroidism. 

3. **Lab Findings**: 
   - Elevated 24-hour urinary VMA and metanephrines indicate increased catecholamine production, which is commonly seen in pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma.
   - Elevated serum epinephrine suggests catecholamine secreting tumors.
   - Elevated calcitonin indicates medullary thyroid carcinoma, which is associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2).
   - Hypercalcemia and hyperglycemia can also be seen in multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes due to parathyroid hormone elevation and excess catecholamines affecting glucose metabolism.

4. **Diagnosis**: The combination of thyroid involvement (thyromegaly and elevated calcitonin), catecholamine excess (elevated VMA and metanephrines), and parathyroid hormone elevation indicates a diagnosis consistent with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia (MEN) type 2B, which encompasses medullary thyroid carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, and mucosal neuromas.

Considering all the information, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is:

**Answer: (D) Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 2B**.
Path 3: Let's analyze the information step by step. 

1. The patient is a 45-year-old woman with symptoms including headaches, palpitations, and diaphoresis, along with a history of hypertension. 
2. She has diffuse thyroid swelling (thyromegaly) and has experienced long bone pain, which may suggest osteitis fibrosa cystica due to hyperparathyroidism.
3. The lab results indicate elevated 24-hour urinary VMA and metanephrines, which are markers for catecholamine-secreting tumors, such as pheochromocytomas.
4. Elevated serum epinephrine, calcitonin, and parathormone levels further support an endocrine disorder.
5. Hypercalcemia indicates increased parathyroid hormone activity, and hyperglycemia suggests possible glucagon or catecholamine effects.

Based on these findings, the combination of medullary thyroid carcinoma (elevated calcitonin), pheochromocytoma (elevated epinephrine), and primary hyperparathyroidism (elevated parathormone leading to hypercalcemia) suggests Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia (MEN) 2A.

Thus, the most likely diagnosis is:

**Answer: (C) Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 2A**
Path 4: Let's analyze the symptoms and laboratory findings step by step to determine the most likely diagnosis.

1. **Symptoms**: The patient presents with:
   - Headaches
   - Palpitations
   - Diaphoresis (sweating)
   - Diffuse thyroid swelling (thyromegaly)
   - Bone pain
   - Anxiety and apprehension
   - Increased pulse rate and high blood pressure

2. **Laboratory Findings**:
   - Elevated 24-hour urinary VMA (vanillylmandelic acid) and metanephrines, which are markers for catecholamine-secreting tumors, such as pheochromocytoma.
   - Elevated serum epinephrine, which supports the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma.
   - Elevated calcitonin, which is associated with medullary thyroid carcinoma.
   - Elevated parathormone (PTH) levels, indicating potential hyperparathyroidism.
   - Hypercalcemia and hyperglycemia, which may occur with multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes.

3. **Diagnosis Consideration**:
   - **Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia (MEN) 2A**: Associated with medullary thyroid carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, and primary hyperparathyroidism.
   - **Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia (MEN) 2B**: Similar to MEN 2A but includes mucosal neuromas and marfanoid habitus, and also presents with medullary thyroid carcinoma and pheochromocytoma.
   - **MEN 1**: Typically involves pituitary adenomas, hyperparathyroidism, and pancreatic endocrine tumors, but not medullary thyroid carcinoma or pheochromocytoma.
   - **Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome**: Associated with hemangioblastomas, pheochromocytomas, and renal cell carcinoma but does not typically involve medullary thyroid carcinoma.
   - **Neurofibromatosis**: Characterized by neurofibromas, cafe-au-lait spots, and does not typically present with the combination of symptoms and lab findings mentioned.

Given these considerations, the combination of elevated calcitonin (suggestive of medullary thyroid carcinoma), elevated catecholamines (suggestive of pheochromocytoma), and hyperparathyroidism strongly suggests **Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia (MEN) 2A**.

**Answer: (C) Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 2A**.
Path 5: Let's analyze the information presented step by step.

1. The patient is a 45-year-old woman with symptoms of headache, palpitations, and diaphoresis, which are indicative of catecholamine release, often seen in pheochromocytoma.

2. She has diffuse thyroid swelling (thyromegaly), which suggests a thyroid issue, likely hyperthyroidism, given her symptoms of anxiety, palpitations, and weight loss.

3. The laboratory results show elevated 24-hour urinary VMA and metanephrines, which are markers for pheochromocytoma, a tumor of the adrenal glands that secretes catecholamines.

4. Elevated serum epinephrine, calcitonin, and parathormone levels indicate possible multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN). Calcitonin elevation suggests medullary thyroid carcinoma, and parathormone elevation suggests primary hyperparathyroidism, which can occur in MEN syndromes.

5. The presence of hypercalcemia and hyperglycemia supports the diagnosis of MEN 2, especially MEN 2B, which is associated with medullary thyroid carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, and mucosal neuromas.

Considering all of these findings, the most likely diagnosis is:

**Answer: (D) Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 2B.**
Path 6: Let's analyze the information provided step by step to determine the most likely diagnosis.

1. **Symptoms**: The patient presents with headaches, palpitations, diaphoresis, and anxiety, which are consistent with catecholamine excess. Additionally, she has diffuse thyroid swelling (thyromegaly) and bone pain.

2. **Vital Signs**: She has significantly elevated blood pressure (196/102 mm Hg) and tachycardia (pulse of 116/min), which align with the symptoms of hypertension and anxiety.

3. **Laboratory Findings**: Elevated 24-hour urinary VMA and metanephrines indicate increased catecholamine production, typically seen in pheochromocytoma. Elevated serum epinephrine supports this diagnosis. The presence of hypercalcemia and elevated calcitonin suggests medullary thyroid carcinoma, which is associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndromes.

4. **Thyroid Findings**: The diffuse firm thyromegaly could indicate a thyroid neoplasm or goiter, which can occur in MEN syndromes.

5. **Diagnosis Options**:
   - **Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 2A**: Involves medullary thyroid carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, and primary hyperparathyroidism.
   - **Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 2B**: Similar to MEN 2A but includes mucosal neuromas and is often associated with a marfanoid habitus.
   - **Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 1**: Involves hyperparathyroidism, pancreatic endocrine tumors, and pituitary adenomas, which isn't indicated here.
   - **Neurofibromatosis**: Not directly indicated in this case.
   - **Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome**: Involves various tumors but does not typically include the symptoms described.

Given the presence of symptoms consistent with both pheochromocytoma (elevated catecholamines) and medullary thyroid carcinoma (elevated calcitonin), the most likely diagnosis here is:

**Answer: (D) Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 2B**
Path 7: Let's analyze the information step by step to arrive at the most likely diagnosis.

The patient presents with:
- Headache, palpitations, and diaphoresis, which are indicative of catecholamine excess.
- A history of hypertension and a high pulse rate.
- Diffuse thyroid swelling (thyromegaly) and anxiety.
- Elevated 24-hour urinary VMA and metanephrines, which are markers for pheochromocytoma (catecholamine-secreting tumor).
- Elevated serum epinephrine, calcitonin, and parathormone levels.
- Hypercalcemia (high calcium levels) and hyperglycemia (high blood sugar levels).

Given the elevated calcitonin and parathormone levels, the presence of thyroid swelling, and the symptoms of catecholamine excess, this constellation of findings is highly suggestive of Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia (MEN) syndrome.

1. **MEN 2A**: This syndrome is characterized by medullary thyroid carcinoma (elevated calcitonin), pheochromocytoma (elevated catecholamines), and primary hyperparathyroidism (elevated parathormone and hypercalcemia).
2. **MEN 2B**: Similar to MEN 2A but also includes mucosal neuromas and is associated with a marfanoid habitus, which does not fit this patient's profile.
3. **MEN 1**: Characterized by pituitary tumors, hyperparathyroidism, and pancreatic endocrine tumors, but does not explain the elevated calcitonin or the thyroid swelling.
4. **Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome**: Associated with hemangioblastomas and pheochromocytomas but does not typically present with medullary thyroid carcinoma.
5. **Neurofibromatosis**: Associated with neurofibromas and café-au-lait spots, not with the endocrine abnormalities observed.

Based on the findings, especially the presence of both pheochromocytoma and medullary thyroid carcinoma along with primary hyperparathyroidism, the most accurate diagnosis for this patient is:

**Answer: (C) Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 2A**.
Path 8: Let's analyze the clinical scenario step by step.

1. **Symptoms**: The patient presents with headaches, palpitations, diaphoresis, and pain in the long bones. She is thin, anxious, has moist and warm skin, and exhibits fine tremors during anxiety. These symptoms suggest a hyperadrenergic state, which is commonly associated with conditions involving catecholamine-secreting tumors such as pheochromocytoma.

2. **Thyroid Findings**: The patient has a diffuse thyroid swelling (thyromegaly), which raises suspicion for thyroid disease, particularly hyperthyroidism, which could contribute to her anxiety and tremors.

3. **Laboratory Results**: The laboratory findings reveal:
   - Elevated 24-hour urinary VMA and metanephrines, which are specific for pheochromocytoma (a tumor of the adrenal gland that secretes catecholamines).
   - Elevated serum epinephrine, calcitonin, and parathormone levels.
   - Hypercalcemia and hyperglycemia.

4. **Elevated Calcitonin**: This suggests a medullary thyroid carcinoma, which is associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 2 syndromes.

5. **Diagnosis**:
   - **MEN 2A** is characterized by medullary thyroid carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, and primary hyperparathyroidism.
   - **MEN 2B** includes medullary thyroid carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, mucosal neuromas, and marfanoid habitus.
   - **MEN 1** is associated with pituitary tumors, hyperparathyroidism, and pancreatic endocrine tumors.
   - **Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome** is associated with hemangioblastomas, renal cell carcinoma, and pheochromocytomas but does not typically cause elevated calcitonin or thyroid enlargement.

Based on the symptoms and lab findings, particularly the combination of pheochromocytoma and elevated calcitonin indicating medullary thyroid carcinoma, the most likely diagnosis is:

**Answer: (D) Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 2B**.
Path 9: In this case, the patient presents with multiple symptoms that suggest an endocrinological disorder. Here are the key points to consider:

1. **Thyromegaly**: The diffuse thyroid swelling indicates potential thyroid involvement, which is often seen in multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndromes.
2. **Elevated urinary VMA and metanephrines**: These findings indicate increased catecholamine production, which is characteristic of pheochromocytoma. This is often associated with MEN syndromes.
3. **Elevated calcitonin**: This suggests the presence of medullary thyroid carcinoma, which is associated with MEN 2A and MEN 2B.
4. **Hypercalcemia**: This can be seen in conditions involving parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion, which is also part of MEN 2A.
5. **Symptoms**: The symptoms of hypertension, palpitations, anxiety, and diaphoresis align with catecholamine excess.

Given the combination of these findings:

- **MEN 2A** is characterized by medullary thyroid carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, and primary hyperparathyroidism.
- **MEN 2B** includes medullary thyroid carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, as well as mucosal neuromas and marfanoid habitus.

Considering the symptoms and laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis is:

**(D) Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 2B**. 

This is because the patient has features consistent with both medullary thyroid carcinoma (indicated by elevated calcitonin and thyromegaly) and pheochromocytoma (indicated by elevated catecholamines), along with the physical presentation.
Path 10: Let's think step by step. 

The patient presents with several key features: 
- Headache, palpitations, and diaphoresis suggest a catecholamine-secreting tumor, commonly associated with pheochromocytoma.
- The presence of diffuse thyromegaly and symptoms of anxiety, palpitations, and tremors can indicate hyperthyroidism.
- The elevated 24-hour urinary VMA and metanephrines support a diagnosis of pheochromocytoma.
- Elevated serum epinephrine indicates catecholamine excess, and the presence of hypercalcemia and hyperglycemia raises suspicion for a multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndrome.

Given these features, the most likely diagnosis is **Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 2A**, which is associated with medullary thyroid carcinoma (increased calcitonin), pheochromocytoma (increased catecholamines), and primary hyperparathyroidism (associated with hypercalcemia).

Therefore, the answer is: **(C) Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 2A**.

Question: A 72-year-old man presents to his primary care physician because he has had difficulty swallowing. Specifically, he occasionally feels like he is choking while eating solids and then later regurgitates the undigested food. In addition, he says that his family has been complaining that he now has really bad breath. Based on clinical suspicion, he is sent for a barium swallow study, which reveals that there is a collection of dye posterior to the esophagus. Between which of the following muscles did the dye most likely enter the collection from the esophagus? (E) Through 2 parts of the cricopharyngeus (A) Circular and longitudinal muscle of the esophagus (B) Cricopharyngeus and circular muscle of the esophagus (C) Cricopharyngeus and thyropharyngeus (D) Superior and inferior pharyngeal constrictors
Reason: Reasoning: The symptoms described, such as difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) and regurgitation of undigested food, suggest a structural problem in the esophagus or pharynx. The barium swallow study indicates a collection of dye posterior to the esophagus, which is likely to be due to a diverticulum forming between the cricopharyngeus and thyropharyngeus muscles, known as a Zenker's diverticulum, particularly common in older adults. Thus, the involvement of these specific muscles aligns with the anatomical relationship related to the formation of the diverticulum.
Answer: (C) Cricopharyngeus and thyropharyngeus

Question: An 11-year-old girl presents to the emergency department with a 12-hour history of severe abdominal pain. She says that the pain started near the middle of her abdomen and moved to the right lower quadrant after about 10 hours. Several hours after the pain started she also started experiencing nausea and loss of appetite. On presentation, her temperature is 102.5°F (39.2°C), blood pressure is 115/74 mmHg, pulse is 102/min, and respirations are 21/min. Physical exam reveals rebound tenderness in the right lower quadrant. Raising the patient's right leg with the knee flexed significantly increases the pain. Which of the following is the most common cause of this patient's symptoms in children? (C) Lymphoid hyperplasia (A) Fecalith obstruction (D) Meckel diverticulum (B) Ingestion of indigestible object (E) Parasitic infection
Reason: Reasoning: The presentation of severe abdominal pain that migrates to the right lower quadrant, fever, nausea, loss of appetite, and specific physical exam findings suggest acute appendicitis. In children, lymphoid hyperplasia, which is an increase in lymphoid tissue due to immune response, is the most common etiology leading to obstruction of the appendiceal lumen in appendicitis, especially as the lymphoid tissue can enlarge during infections. This is more prevalent in pediatric patients compared to other causes like fecaliths.
Answer: (C) Lymphoid hyperplasia

She admits to binge eating several times per month, after which she usually induces vomiting for compensation. She exercises daily in an effort to lose weight. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 60 kg (132 lb); BMI is 21.3 kg/m2. Physical examination shows calluses on the knuckles and bilateral parotid gland enlargement. Oropharyngeal examination shows eroded dental enamel and decalcified teeth. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient's condition? (E) Fluoxetine (A) Orlistat (D) Venlafaxine (B) Mirtazapine (C) Buspirone
Reason: Reasoning: The patient's symptoms are indicative of bulimia nervosa, characterized by binge eating followed by compensatory behaviors such as vomiting, along with physical signs like dental erosion and parotid gland enlargement. Fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), is the only medication approved for the treatment of bulimia nervosa and has been shown to effectively reduce binge-eating and purging behaviors, making it the most appropriate pharmacotherapy in this case.
Answer: (E) Fluoxetine

Question: A 25-year old man comes to the physician because of fatigue over the past 6 months. He has been to the emergency room several times over the past 3 years for recurrent shoulder and patella dislocations. Physical examination shows abnormal joint hypermobility and skin hyperextensibility. A high-frequency mid-systolic click is heard on auscultation. Which of the following is most likely to result in an earlier onset of this patient’s auscultation finding? (D) Valsalva release phase (E) Leaning forward (B) Abrupt standing (A) Hand grip (C) Rapid squatting
Reason: The answer is (B) Abrupt standing. This maneuver can lead to a decrease in venous return to the heart and a subsequent drop in blood pressure, often resulting in compensatory changes in heart sounds. These changes in blood flow dynamics can result in the earlier onset of auscultation findings like a mid-systolic click due to increased left ventricular outflow tract dynamics, characteristic of conditions like mitral valve prolapse.
Answer: (B) Abrupt standing

Question: A 62-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of exertional shortness of breath and fatigue. She sometimes wakes up at night coughing and gasping for air. Cardiac examination shows a grade 3/6 holosystolic murmur best heard at the apex. Which of the following physical exam findings would be consistent with an exacerbation of this patient's condition? (E) Radiation of the murmur to the axilla (A) Early diastolic extra heart sound (D) Absence of A2 heart sound (B) Prominent V wave (C) Head bobbing
Reason: The answer is (A) Early diastolic extra heart sound. In the context of mitral regurgitation, an early diastolic extra heart sound, such as an S3, may indicate volume overload in the left atrium or left ventricle, which can occur during exacerbation of the condition. This finding suggests worsening heart function as the heart struggles to manage the increased workload, especially in the setting of exertional symptoms and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.
Answer: (A) Early diastolic extra heart sound

Question: A 3-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of a 3-day history of a pruritic skin rash on his chest. His mother says that he has no history of dermatological problems. He was born at term and has been healthy except for recurrent episodes of otitis media. His immunizations are up-to-date. He appears pale. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 110/min, respirations are 26/min, and blood pressure is 102/62 mm Hg. Examination shows vesicles and flaccid bullae with thin brown crusts on the chest. Lateral traction of the surrounding skin leads to sloughing. Examination of the oral mucosa shows no abnormalities. Complete blood count is within the reference range. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? (D) Bullous pemphigoid (E) Pemphigus vulgaris (C) Stevens-Johnson syndrome (A) Bullous impetigo (B) Dermatitis herpetiformis
Reason: The most likely diagnosis is (A) Bullous impetigo. The presence of vesicles and flaccid bullae, especially with thin brown crusts, is characteristic of bullous impetigo, which is a bacterial skin infection commonly caused by Staphylococcus aureus. The boy's lack of underlying dermatological issues, the acute presentation, and his pale appearance could suggest some systemic involvement, but the skin findings align well with the infectious nature of impetigo rather than an immune-mediated condition like pemphigus or bullous pemphigoid.
Answer: (A) Bullous impetigo

Question: Eight days after sigmoid resection for acute diverticulitis, a 61-year-old man has left-sided flank pain. He has been on bowel rest since admission. Other than multiple admissions for alcohol withdrawal, he has no history of serious illness. Current medications include intravenous cefepime and morphine. His temperature is 36.9°C (98.4°F), pulse is 89/min, and blood pressure is 118/75 mm Hg. Abdominal exam shows a well-healing incision with minimal serous drainage. Examination of the skin shows scattered spider angiomas, a large hematoma on the left flank, and numerous bruises over the abdomen and extremities. He complains of pain when his left hip is extended. Laboratory studies show:
Hemoglobin 8.4 g/dL
Mean corpuscular volume 102 μm3
Leukocyte count 8,200/mm3
Platelet count 170,000/mm3
Serum
Bleeding time 4 minutes
Prothrombin time 26 seconds

Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's current symptoms?" (A) Resistance of Factor V inactivation (B) Impaired activation of factor VII (D) Decreased synthesis of thrombopoietin (E) Deficiency of folic acid (C) Administration of heparin
Reason: The answer is (B) Impaired activation of factor VII. The patient's laboratory findings show an elevated prothrombin time (PT) with a normal activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), which is characteristic of a deficiency in the extrinsic pathway of coagulation, where factor VII plays a crucial role. Given the patient's recent surgery, it is likely that his exposure to factors causing liver dysfunction or malabsorption due to alcohol use and the stress of surgery has impaired the activation of factor VII, leading to his current bleeding symptoms and bruising.
Answer: (B) Impaired activation of factor VII

Question: A 35-year-old Caucasian female with a history of rheumatoid arthritis presents to your clinic with pleuritic chest pain that improves while leaning forward. Which of the following additional findings would you expect to observe in this patient? (B) Exaggerated amplitude of pulse on inspiration (E) S3 heart sound (C) Pulsatile abdominal mass (A) Increase in jugular venous pressure on inspiration (D) Continuous machine-like murmur
Reason: The answer is (A) Increase in jugular venous pressure on inspiration. This clinical presentation suggests that the patient may have pericarditis, which can be seen in individuals with autoimmune conditions like rheumatoid arthritis. A characteristic physical exam finding in pericarditis is that the jugular venous pressure can increase upon inspiration (known as Kussmaul's sign), reflecting impaired diastolic filling of the heart due to pericardial effusion or inflammation, thus correlating with the patient's symptoms of pleuritic chest pain.
Answer: (A) Increase in jugular venous pressure on inspiration

Question: A 26-year-old woman presents to her gynecologist with complaints of pain with her menses and during intercourse. She also complains of chest pain that occurs whenever she has her menstrual period. The patient has a past medical history of bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder. Her current medications include lithium and haloperidol. Review of systems is notable only for pain when she has a bowel movement relieved by defecation. Her temperature is 98.2°F (36.8°C), blood pressure is 114/74 mmHg, pulse is 70/min, respirations are 14/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Pelvic exam is notable for a tender adnexal mass. The patient's uterus is soft, boggy, and tender. Which of the following is the most appropriate method of confirming the diagnosis in this patient? (D) MRI (E) Transvaginal ultrasound (B) Endometrial biopsy (A) Clinical diagnosis (C) Laparoscopy
Reason: Laparoscopy is considered the gold standard for diagnosing conditions such as endometriosis, especially when there is a combination of pelvic pain, tenderness in the adnexa, and characteristic symptoms like painful menstruation and dyspareunia. This minimally invasive procedure allows direct visualization of the pelvic organs and any potential endometrial implants, making it the most definitive method for confirming the diagnosis.

Question: A 25-year-old man with a genetic disorder presents for genetic counseling because he is concerned about the risk that any children he has will have the same disease as himself. Specifically, since childhood he has had difficulty breathing requiring bronchodilators, inhaled corticosteroids, and chest physiotherapy. He has also had diarrhea and malabsorption requiring enzyme replacement therapy. If his wife comes from a population where 1 in 10,000 people are affected by this same disorder, which of the following best represents the likelihood a child would be affected as well? (A) 0.01% (C) 1% (E) 50% (D) 2% (B) 0.5%
Reason: The likelihood of their child being affected by the genetic disorder can be estimated based on the inheritance pattern of the condition, as well as the prevalence within the population that the wife's family belongs to. If the disorder is autosomal recessive, the husband, being affected, would carry two copies of the recessive allele, while the wife would have a 1 in 10,000 prevalence suggesting she is likely a carrier; thus, the probability of their child inheriting the disorder would be roughly 1 in 200, or 1%.

Pelvic examination shows a uterus consistent in size with a 36-week gestation. Laboratory studies show:
Hemoglobin 10.6 g/dL
Serum
Glucose 88 mg/dL
Hepatitis B surface antigen negative
Hepatitis C antibody negative
HIV antibody positive
HIV load 11,000 copies/mL (N < 1000 copies/mL)
Ultrasonography shows an intrauterine fetus consistent in size with a 36-week gestation. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management of this patient?" (C) Start cART and prepare for vaginal delivery at 38 weeks' gestation (B) Start cART and schedule cesarean delivery at 38 weeks' gestation (D) Intrapartum zidovudine and cesarean delivery at 38 weeks' gestation (E) Conduct cesarean delivery immediately (A) Intrapartum zidovudine and vaginal delivery when labor occurs
Reason: The correct answer is (B) Start cART and schedule cesarean delivery at 38 weeks' gestation. This approach is recommended for a pregnant woman with HIV who has a viral load greater than 1000 copies/mL at the time of delivery. A cesarean delivery reduces the risk of maternal-fetal transmission of HIV, and starting combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) ensures that the mother's viral load is managed effectively to minimize the risk to the infant.

Question: A 16-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department by her family for not being responsive. The patient had locked herself in her room for several hours after breaking up with her boyfriend. When her family found her, they were unable to arouse her and immediately took her to the hospital. The patient has a past medical history of anorexia nervosa, which is being treated, chronic pain, and depression. She is not currently taking any medications. The patient has a family history of depression in her mother and grandmother. IV fluids are started, and the patient seems to be less somnolent. Her temperature is 101°F (38.3°C), pulse is 112/min, blood pressure is 90/60 mmHg, respirations are 18/min, and oxygen saturation is 95% on room air. On physical exam, the patient is somnolent and has dilated pupils and demonstrates clonus. She has dry skin and an ultrasound of her bladder reveals 650 mL of urine. The patient is appropriately treated with sodium bicarbonate. Which of the following is the best indicator of the extent of this patient's toxicity? (E) Serum drug level (B) Liver enzyme elevation (D) QT prolongation (C) QRS prolongation (A) Anion gap acidosis
Reason: The correct answer is (C) QRS prolongation. QRS prolongation is a critical indicator of toxicity, particularly in cases of tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) overdose, which could be relevant here given the patient's history of depression and the symptoms of somnolence and clonus. Prolongation of the QRS interval reflects the cardiac effects of the drug and serves as a marker for the severity of the toxicity, influencing the management and potential complications associated with the overdose.

Question: Six days after undergoing a thoracic endovascular aortic repair following a high-speed motorcycle accident, a 29-year-old woman develops a fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Serum studies show a sodium concentration of 129 mEq/L. An x-ray of the chest shows a left-sided pleural effusion. Thoracentesis is performed and shows milky white fluid in the pleural space that remains uniform after centrifugation. A culture of the pleural fluid shows no organisms. Further analysis of the fluid would most likely show which of the following? (B) Antinuclear antibodies (D) Cholesterol crystals (A) High triglycerides (C) High adenosine deaminase (E) High LDH
Reason: The symptoms and pleural fluid characteristics described in the scenario suggest a chylothorax, which is characterized by a milky appearance due to the presence of lymphatic fluid rich in triglycerides. Since the fluid analysis shows no organisms after culture, the high triglyceride levels in the pleural fluid would support this diagnosis, as they are indicative of chylous effusion resulting from disruption of lymphatic drainage, often observed after thoracic surgeries or trauma.
Answer: (A) High triglycerides

Question: A 23-year-old man comes to the physician for evaluation of decreased hearing, dizziness, and ringing in his right ear for the past 6 months. Physical examination shows multiple soft, yellow plaques and papules on his arms, chest, and back. There is sensorineural hearing loss and weakness of facial muscles bilaterally. His gait is unsteady. An MRI of the brain shows a 3-cm mass near the right internal auditory meatus and a 2-cm mass at the left cerebellopontine angle. The abnormal cells in these masses are most likely derived from which of the following embryological structures? (E) Mesoderm (C) Neural crest (D) Notochord (A) Neural tube (B) Surface ectoderm
Reason: The clinical presentation of the patient, including the presence of multiple soft, yellow plaques (likely xanthomas), sensorineural hearing loss, and the bilateral masses at the internal auditory meatus and cerebellopontine angle, is suggestive of neurofibromatosis type II (NF2), which is characterized by tumors arising from schwann cells. These cells are derived from the neural crest, which is the embryological structure responsible for producing various types of neuronal and glial cells, including Schwann cells that form nerve sheath tumors.

Question: A 66-year-old woman with hypertension comes to the physician because of crampy, dull abdominal pain and weight loss for 1 month. The pain is located in the epigastric region and typically occurs within the first hour after eating. She has had a 7-kg (15.4-lb) weight loss in the past month. She has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for 20 years. Physical examination shows a scaphoid abdomen and diffuse tenderness to palpation. Laboratory studies including carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and lipase concentrations are within the reference range. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms? (E) Decreased motility of gastric smooth muscle (D) Focal wall thickening in the colon (C) Embolus in the superior mesenteric artery (B) Malignant mass at the head of the pancreas (A) Narrowing of the celiac artery
Reason: The patient's presentation, particularly the postprandial abdominal pain, weight loss, and smoking history, suggests that she may be experiencing chronic mesenteric ischemia, which is often caused by narrowing of the celiac artery. The timing of her symptoms, occurring within the first hour after eating, indicates that blood flow to the gastrointestinal tract is insufficient during digestion, leading to pain as her body's demand for blood increases but cannot be met due to the narrowed vessel.
Answer: (A) Narrowing of the celiac artery

Question: A 75-year-old man presents to the clinic for chronic fatigue of 3 months duration. Past medical history is significant for type 2 diabetes and hypertension, both of which are controlled with medications, as well as constipation. He denies any fever, weight loss, pain, or focal neurologic deficits. A complete blood count reveals microcytic anemia, and a stool guaiac test is positive for blood. He is subsequently evaluated with a colonoscopy. The physician notes some “small pouches” in the colon despite poor visualization due to inadequate bowel prep. What is the blood vessel that supplies the area with the above findings? (D) Right colic artery (C) Middle colic artery (B) Inferior mesenteric artery (E) Superior mesenteric artery (A) Ileocolic artery
Reason: In this scenario, the patient's chronic fatigue, microcytic anemia, and positive stool guaiac test suggest potential gastrointestinal bleeding, which can be associated with conditions such as diverticulosis, often characterized by "small pouches" in the colon. The inferior mesenteric artery supplies the distal parts of the colon, including the sigmoid colon and rectum, which are likely areas of concern given the findings, making (B) Inferior mesenteric artery the appropriate choice for the blood vessel supplying this area.

Question: A 28-year-old G1P1 woman is brought into the clinic by her concerned husband. The husband has noted that his wife is not behaving normally. She no longer enjoys his company or is not particularly happy around their newborn. The newborn was delivered 3 weeks ago via normal vaginal delivery with no complications. He also notes that his wife seems to be off in some other world with her thoughts. Overall, she appears to be drained, and her movements and speech seem slow. The patient complains that the newborn is sucking the lifeforce from her when she breastfeeds. She has thus stopped eating to save herself from this parasite. Which of the following statements is true regarding this patient’s most likely condition? (C) This patient’s condition is self-limited (A) If symptoms present within a month after delivery and treatment occurs promptly, the prognosis is good (E) Electroconvulsive therapy is the first-line therapy for this patient’s condition (B) Risk for this patient’s condition increases with each pregnancy (D) Ziprasidone is the first-line pharmacotherapy recommended for this patient’s condition
Reason: The answer is (A) If symptoms present within a month after delivery and treatment occurs promptly, the prognosis is good because this patient's presentation is indicative of postpartum depression (PPD). When treated early, especially with appropriate psychotherapy or antidepressants, most patients experience significant improvement and have a favorable long-term outcome, highlighting the importance of timely intervention.
Answer: (A) If symptoms present within a month after delivery and treatment occurs promptly, the prognosis is good

Question: A 71-year-old man comes to the physician accompanied by his wife because of a 6-month history of worsening episodic upper abdominal pain and an 8-kg (17.6-lb) weight loss. The pain is dull, nonradiating, worse after eating, and occasionally associated with bloating and diarrhea. His symptoms have not improved despite 4 weeks of treatment with omeprazole. He attributes his weight loss to recently eating very small portions and avoiding fatty foods. He has hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. He underwent a coronary artery bypass graft operation for coronary artery disease 8 years ago. Current medications include lisinopril, metoprolol, atorvastatin, and aspirin. He has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for 20 years and drinks 1–2 beers daily. His pulse is 79/min and blood pressure is 138/89 mm Hg. Examination shows a soft abdomen without tenderness to palpation or guarding. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis? (A) Serum CA 19-9 (D) Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (C) CT angiography of the abdomen (B) Right upper quadrant abdominal ultrasound (E) Upper endoscopy
Reason: The answer is (C) CT angiography of the abdomen because the patient's symptoms—episodic upper abdominal pain worsened after eating, weight loss, and avoidance of fatty foods—along with his age, smoking history, and prior coronary artery disease, raise suspicion for pancreatic pathology, including cancer or chronic pancreatitis. A CT angiography would provide detailed imaging of the pancreas and surrounding structures, helping to confirm the diagnosis by revealing any masses or changes indicative of pancreatic disease.
Answer: (C) CT angiography of the abdomen

Question: A 47-year-old farmer presents to his primary care physician for the first time appointment. The patient has never seen a doctor and states that he is in good health. He has worked as a farmer for the past 30 years and has no complaints. His temperature is 98.9°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 197/118 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 14/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for an obese man in no current distress. Laboratory values are seen below.

Serum:
Na+: 139 mEq/L
Cl-: 101 mEq/L
K+: 5.2 mEq/L
HCO3-: 25 mEq/L
BUN: 34 mg/dL
Glucose: 179 mg/dL
Creatinine: 2.1 mg/dL
Ca2+: 10.2 mg/dL

Which of the following is the best management of this patient's blood pressure? (B) Hydrochlorothiazide (A) Carvedilol (C) Lisinopril (E) Nicardipine (D) Metoprolol
Reason: The best management of this patient's blood pressure is (C) Lisinopril. This choice is supported by the fact that the patient presents with hypertension and signs of possible chronic kidney disease (elevated creatinine and BUN), which indicates a need for renal protection. Lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor, not only helps to lower blood pressure effectively but also provides renal protective benefits by reducing glomerular pressure in patients with kidney impairment.
Answer: (C) Lisinopril

Question: A 17-year-old boy comes to the physician because of a nonpruritic rash on his chest for 1 week. He returned from a trip to Puerto Rico 10 days ago. He started using a new laundry detergent after returning. He has type 1 diabetes mellitus controlled with insulin. His mother has Hashimoto thyroiditis, and his sister has severe facial acne. Examination of the skin shows multiple, nontender, round, hypopigmented macules on the chest and trunk. There is fine scaling when the lesions are scraped with a spatula. Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's symptoms? (A) Autoimmune destruction of melanocytes (E) Infection with Trichophyton rubrum (D) Antigen uptake by Langerhans cells (B) Increased sebum production (C) Increased growth of Malassezia globosa
Reason: The most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's symptoms is (C) Increased growth of Malassezia globosa. This conclusion can be supported by the presentation of hypopigmented macules with fine scaling, which is characteristic of tinea versicolor, a fungal skin condition caused by an overgrowth of Malassezia species, particularly in individuals with certain risk factors, such as those with diabetes mellitus or recent travel in warm, humid climates.
Answer: (C) Increased growth of Malassezia globosa

Question: A 37-year-old woman, gravida 3, para 2, at 35 weeks' gestation is brought to the emergency department for the evaluation of lower abdominal and back pain and vaginal bleeding that started one hour ago. She has had no prenatal care. Her first two pregnancies were uncomplicated and her children were delivered vaginally. The patient smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 20 years; she reduced to half a pack every 2 days during her pregnancies. Her pulse is 80/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg. The uterus is tender, and regular hypertonic contractions are felt every 2 minutes. There is dark blood on the vulva, the introitus, and on the medial aspect of both thighs bilaterally. The fetus is in a cephalic presentation. The fetal heart rate is 158/min and reactive with no decelerations. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? (D) Administration of betamethasone (A) Transvaginal ultrasonography (C) Elective cesarean delivery (B) Vaginal delivery (E) Administration of terbutaline
Reason: The most appropriate next step in management is (B) Vaginal delivery. This choice is supported by the fact that the patient is at 35 weeks of gestation with regular contractions and a reactive fetal heart rate, indicating that the fetus is likely in distress. Given her history of two uncomplicated vaginal deliveries and no indication of a need for emergency intervention such as a cesarean section, proceeding with vaginal delivery is a reasonable approach unless complications arise during the delivery process.
Answer: (B) Vaginal delivery

[INFO] Opinion paths:
Path 1: To analyze the results of the study, let's break down the key components:

1. **Odds Ratio (OR)**: The computed odds ratio of 2.1 suggests that individuals with low educational status have more than twice the odds of experiencing a myocardial infarction (MI) compared to those with high educational status.

2. **Confidence Interval (CI)**: The confidence interval of 0.9–9.7 indicates the range of values within which the true odds ratio is likely to fall. Since this interval includes 1 (the lower bound is 0.9), it suggests that the association is not statistically significant.

3. **Statistical Significance**: For an association to be considered statistically significant, the confidence interval should not include 1. Since the CI does include 1, we cannot conclude that low education is definitively a risk factor for MI in this population.

Based on this analysis, the most appropriate inference from the study would be:

**Answer: (A) The association is not statistically significant, and low education is not a risk factor.**
Path 2: Let's analyze the information provided step by step.

1. **Study Design**: The study compares 30 young patients with myocardial infarction (MI) to 60 healthy controls, focusing on educational status as a potential risk factor.

2. **Odds Ratio**: The computed odds ratio is 2.1 for the association between low education and the risk of MI. An odds ratio greater than 1 suggests a potential positive association between low educational status and MI risk.

3. **Confidence Interval**: The confidence interval for the odds ratio is 0.9 to 9.7. Since this interval includes 1, it indicates that the result is not statistically significant. An odds ratio with a confidence interval that includes 1 means that we cannot conclude there is a true association.

4. **Statistical Significance**: The lack of a statistically significant association means that we cannot definitively say that low educational status is a risk factor for MI in this young population.

Given this information, the most appropriate inference from the study is:

(A) The association is not statistically significant, and low education is not a risk factor.
Path 3: Let's analyze the information step by step:

1. **Study Design**: The study includes two groups: patients with myocardial infarction (MI) under 30 years old and a control group of similar healthy individuals. 

2. **Odds Ratio**: An odds ratio (OR) of 2.1 indicates that individuals with low educational status have more than double the odds of having an MI compared to those with high educational status.

3. **Confidence Interval**: The confidence interval (CI) for the odds ratio is 0.9 to 9.7. This range includes 1.0, which suggests that the association between low education and MI is not statistically significant. An OR that includes 1 implies that there is no significant association.

4. **Statistical Significance**: Since the confidence interval includes 1, we cannot conclude that low education is a statistically significant risk factor for MI in this population.

Based on this analysis, the most appropriate inference is:

**Answer**: (A) The association is not statistically significant, and low education is not a risk factor.
Path 4: Let's analyze the information step by step.

1. **Understanding the Odds Ratio (OR)**: The odds ratio calculated is 2.1. This suggests that individuals with low education have more than double the odds of experiencing a myocardial infarction (MI) compared to those with high educational status.

2. **Confidence Interval (CI)**: The confidence interval provided is 0.9–9.7. This range includes 1, which indicates that the association is not statistically significant. If the CI includes 1, it suggests that there is no statistically significant difference between the two groups concerning the risk of MI.

3. **Statistical Significance**: Since the confidence interval includes 1, we conclude that the association between low educational status and the risk of MI is not statistically significant.

4. **Risk Factor**: Although the odds ratio suggests that low education may be associated with a higher risk of MI, the lack of statistical significance means we cannot definitively conclude that low education is a risk factor.

Given this information, the best inference that can be made about the association between young age MI and educational status is:

**Answer: (A) The association is not statistically significant, and low education is not a risk factor.**
Path 5: Let's think through the provided information step by step.

1. **Study Design**: The study examines the association between educational status and the risk of myocardial infarction (MI) in young patients (age < 30 years) by comparing a study group of 30 patients with MI to a control group of 60 healthy individuals.

2. **Odds Ratio (OR)**: An odds ratio of 2.1 indicates that individuals with low educational status have more than double the odds of having an MI compared to those with high educational status. However, we need to consider the confidence interval (CI) to assess statistical significance.

3. **Confidence Interval**: The CI provided is 0.9–9.7. Since this interval includes 1 (the null value), it indicates that the association is not statistically significant. A CI that includes 1 suggests that we cannot confidently say that there is a difference in risk based on educational status.

4. **Conclusion**: Given that the association is not statistically significant, we cannot conclude that low educational status is a risk factor for MI in this population. 

Based on this analysis, the correct inference is:

(A) The association is not statistically significant, and low education is not a risk factor.
Path 6: Let's analyze the information provided step by step.

1. **Study Design**: The study investigates the association between low educational status and the risk of myocardial infarction (MI) in young individuals (age < 30).

2. **Participants**: There are 30 young patients with MI (study group) and 60 similar healthy individuals (control group).

3. **Odds Ratio**: An odds ratio of 2.1 suggests that individuals with low educational status have more than twice the odds of experiencing a myocardial infarction compared to those with high educational status.

4. **Confidence Interval**: The confidence interval given is 0.9–9.7. This range includes 1 (the null value), which indicates that the association may not be statistically significant. For an odds ratio to be considered statistically significant, the confidence interval should not include 1.

5. **Conclusion**: Since the confidence interval includes 1, the association between low education and MI is not statistically significant. Therefore, we cannot conclude that low educational status is a risk factor based on this study.

Based on this reasoning, the best answer is:

**(A) The association is not statistically significant, and low education is not a risk factor.**
Path 7: Let's analyze the information step by step:

1. The study involves a comparison between young patients with myocardial infarction (MI) and healthy individuals, with a focus on educational status as a potential risk factor.

2. The odds ratio (OR) calculated for the association between low education and the risk of MI is 2.1, suggesting that individuals with low educational status are more likely to experience MI compared to those with high educational status.

3. However, the confidence interval (CI) for the odds ratio is 0.9–9.7. This interval includes the value 1.0, indicating that the association is not statistically significant at the common alpha level of 0.05. A statistically significant result would require the CI to not include 1.0.

4. Since the odds ratio is not statistically significant (as inferred from the confidence interval), we cannot conclude that low education is a risk factor for MI.

Based on this reasoning, the most accurate inference is:

**Answer: (A) The association is not statistically significant, and low education is not a risk factor.**
Path 8: Let's analyze the information step by step.

1. The odds ratio (OR) of 2.1 indicates that individuals with low educational status are 2.1 times more likely to have a myocardial infarction (MI) compared to those with high educational status.
  
2. However, the confidence interval (CI) of 0.9 to 9.7 includes 1. This means that the association is not statistically significant because a CI that includes 1 indicates that there is no clear evidence of an association.

3. Since the association is not statistically significant, we cannot conclude that low education is a risk factor for MI.

Based on this reasoning, the correct inference is:

(A) The association is not statistically significant, and low education is not a risk factor.
Path 9: Let's analyze the information step by step:

1. **Context**: The study investigates the association between low educational status and the risk of myocardial infarction (MI) in young patients (<30 years old). 

2. **Odds Ratio (OR)**: An odds ratio of 2.1 suggests that individuals with low educational status have more than double the odds of experiencing an MI compared to those with high educational status.

3. **Confidence Interval (CI)**: The confidence interval given is 0.9–9.7. This interval includes 1.0, which indicates that the association is not statistically significant. A confidence interval that includes 1 means that we cannot confidently say that there is a true association between low educational status and MI risk.

4. **Statistical Significance**: Since the confidence interval crosses 1, we conclude that the association is not statistically significant.

5. **Risk Factor Conclusion**: Since the association is not statistically significant, we cannot definitively label low education as a risk factor for MI based on this study.

Based on these points, the correct inference from the study is:

**Answer: (A) The association is not statistically significant, and low education is not a risk factor.**
Path 10: Let's analyze the information step by step.

1. **Understanding the Odds Ratio**: The odds ratio (OR) of 2.1 suggests that those with low educational status have more than twice the odds of experiencing a myocardial infarction (MI) compared to those with high educational status.

2. **Confidence Interval**: The confidence interval (CI) of 0.9–9.7 is crucial here. Since the CI includes 1 (which indicates no association), it suggests that the association between low educational status and MI is not statistically significant. In other words, we cannot conclusively say that low education is a risk factor based on this data.

3. **Statistical Significance**: For an association to be deemed statistically significant, the confidence interval should not include 1. Therefore, since the CI does include 1, we can conclude that the association is not statistically significant.

4. **Final Inference**: Given that the association is not statistically significant, we cannot conclude that low educational status is a risk factor for MI based on this study.

Thus, the correct inference is:

**Answer: (A) The association is not statistically significant, and low education is not a risk factor.**

Question: A 45-year-old man comes to the physician for the evaluation of difficulty swallowing that has worsened over the past year. He also reports some hoarseness and generalized bone, muscle, and joint pain. During the past six months, he has had progressive constipation and two episodes of kidney stones. He also reports recurrent episodes of throbbing headaches, diaphoresis, and palpitations. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. He takes no medications. His vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination and an ECG show no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show calcium concentration of 12 mg/dL, phosphorus concentration of 2 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase concentration of 100 U/L, and calcitonin concentration of 11 pg/mL (N < 8.8). Ultrasonography of the neck shows hypoechoic thyroid lesions with irregular margins and microcalcifications. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition? (A) Mutated NF1 gene (D) Altered RET proto-oncogene expression (B) Exposure to ionizing radiation (E) Disrupted menin protein function (C) Deleted VHL gene
Reason: The answer is (D) Altered RET proto-oncogene expression. The symptoms and findings in this case, such as difficulty swallowing, hoarseness, increased calcium levels, hypoparathyroidism indicated by low phosphorus, and the ultrasonography findings of irregular thyroid lesions, are consistent with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 2 (MEN 2), which is caused by mutations in the RET proto-oncogene. This genetic alteration is known to lead to conditions such as medullary thyroid carcinoma and other endocrine neoplasms, correlating with the patient's clinical presentation.
Answer: (D) Altered RET proto-oncogene expression

Question: A 48-year-old man comes to the physician because of a hypopigmented skin lesion on his finger. He first noticed it 4 weeks ago after cutting his finger with a knife while preparing food. He did not feel the cut. For the past week, he has also had fever, fatigue, and malaise. He has not traveled outside the country since he immigrated from India to join his family in the United States 2 years ago. His temperature is 38.7°C (101.7°F). Physical examination shows a small, healing laceration on the dorsal aspect of the left index finger and an overlying well-defined, hypopigmented macule with raised borders. Sensation to pinprick and light touch is decreased over this area. Which of the following is the most likely causal pathogen of this patient's condition? (E) Malassezia furfur (B) Epidermophyton floccosum (C) Mycobacterium leprae (A) Pseudomonas aeruginosa (D) Leishmania donovani
Reason: The answer is (C) Mycobacterium leprae. The patient's hypopigmented macule with raised borders, the presence of a healing cut, and decreased sensation in the affected area suggest a neurological component commonly associated with leprosy, which is caused by Mycobacterium leprae. Additionally, the patient’s prior immigration from India, a region where leprosy is still prevalent, further supports this diagnosis as a plausible causal pathogen.
Answer: (C) Mycobacterium leprae

Question: A 29-year-old man presents to an STD clinic complaining of a painful lesion at the end of his penis. The patient says it started as a tiny red bump and grew over several days. He has no history of a serious illness and takes no medications. He has had several sexual partners in the past few months. At the clinic, his temperature is 38.2℃ (100.8℉), the blood pressure is 115/70 mm Hg, the pulse is 84/min, and the respirations are 14/min. Examination of the inguinal area shows enlarged and tender lymph nodes, some of which are fluctuant. There is an ulcerated and weeping sore with an erythematous base and ragged edges on the end of his penis. The remainder of the physical examination shows no abnormalities. The result of the Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) is negative. Which of the following diagnoses best explains these findings? (E) Lymphogranuloma venereum (A) Chancre (B) Chancroid (D) Condyloma latum (C) Condyloma acuminatum
Reason: The answer is (B) Chancroid. The presentation of a painful ulcer with an erythematous base and ragged edges, along with the accompanying tender and fluctuant inguinal lymphadenopathy, is characteristic of chancroid, a sexually transmitted infection caused by Haemophilus ducreyi. Additionally, the negative VDRL test helps rule out syphilis, further supporting the diagnosis of chancroid as the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms.
Answer: (B) Chancroid

Question: A 13-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother because she is concerned about her son's behavior. She reports that he has been wearing her dresses at home and asks to be called Lilly. He also stopped going to swim class because he “doesn't feel comfortable in swim trunks.” Since starting puberty about a year ago, he has not had any friends and the teachers report he is consistently being bullied at school. His academic performance has been poor for the last year even though he had maintained an A average the year before. The mother further reports that her son has had mainly female friends since preschool. She also mentions that as a child her son never enjoyed playing with typical boy toys like cars and instead preferred dressing up dolls. The patient was raised by his single mother from the age of 8 because his father left the family due to financial issues. He appears shy. Physical examination shows normal male external genitalia. There is scarce coarse, dark axillary and pubic hair. Upon questioning, the patient reports that he would rather be a girl. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? (D) Gender dysphoria (E) Fetishistic disorder (C) Body dysmorphic disorder (B) Sexual aversion (A) Gender nonconformity
Reason: The situation described in the question strongly indicates that the boy is experiencing significant discomfort with his assigned gender identity and is expressing a desire to be identified as a girl. The consistent behaviors, such as wearing dresses and preferring female friendships, along with his feelings of discomfort in traditionally male clothing, align with the criteria for gender dysphoria. This condition is characterized by a marked difference between an individual's expressed or experienced gender and the gender assigned at birth, leading to distress or impairment in functioning.
Answer: (D) Gender dysphoria

Question: A 67-year-old man presents to his primary care physician because of weak urine stream, and increasing difficulty in initiating and stopping urination. He also reports of mild generalized body aches and weakness during the day. The past medical history includes diabetes mellitus type 2 for 35 years and essential hypertension for 19 years. The medication list includes metformin, vildagliptin, and enalapril. The vital signs include: temperature 36.7°C (98.1°F), blood pressure 151/82 mm Hg, and pulse 88/min. The physical examination is remarkable for markedly enlarged, firm prostate without nodules. The laboratory test results are as follows:
Serum sodium 142 mEq/L
Serum potassium 5.7 mEq/L
Serum chloride 115 mEq/L
Serum bicarbonate 17 mEq/L
Serum creatinine 0.9 mg/dL
Arterial pH 7.31
  Urine pH 5.3
Urine sodium 59 mEq/L
Urine potassium 6.2 mEq/L
Urine chloride 65 mEq/L
Which of the following most likely explains the patient’s findings? (A) Type 1 renal tubular acidosis (B) Type 4 renal tubular acidosis (E) End-stage renal disease (C) Type 2 renal tubular acidosis (D) Fanconi syndrome
Reason: The patient’s clinical presentation, including the symptoms of weak urine stream and difficulty with urination, combined with laboratory findings of hyperkalemia (elevated potassium levels) and metabolic acidosis (low bicarbonate and low pH), suggest Type 4 renal tubular acidosis. This form of renal tubular acidosis is often associated with conditions leading to impaired aldosterone action, such as diabetic kidney disease, which is consistent with the patient’s longstanding diabetes and hypertension.
Answer: (B) Type 4 renal tubular acidosis

Question: A 15-year-old boy is brought to the Emergency department by ambulance from school. He started the day with some body aches and joint pain but then had several episodes of vomiting and started complaining of a terrible headache. The school nurse called for emergency services. The boy was born at 39 weeks gestation via spontaneous vaginal delivery. He is up to date on all vaccines and is meeting all developmental milestones. Past medical history is noncontributory. He is a good student and enjoys sports. At the hospital, his blood pressure is 120/80 mm Hg, heart rate is 105/min, respiratory rate is 21/min, and his temperature is 38.9°C (102.0°F). On physical exam, he appears drowsy with neck stiffness and sensitivity to light. Kernig’s sign is positive. An ophthalmic exam is performed followed by a lumbar puncture. An aliquot of cerebrospinal fluid is sent to microbiology. A gram stain shows gram-negative diplococci. A smear is prepared on blood agar and grows round, smooth, convex colonies with clearly defined edges. Which of the following would identify the described pathogen? (E) Oxidase-positive test and ferments glucose only (C) Growth in colonies (A) Growth in anaerobic conditions (B) No growth on Thayer-Martin medium (D) Oxidase-positive and ferments glucose and maltose
Reason: The clinical presentation of the 15-year-old boy, including fever, neck stiffness, photophobia, and a positive Kernig's sign, along with the findings of gram-negative diplococci in cerebrospinal fluid, strongly suggest a diagnosis of bacterial meningitis caused by Neisseria meningitidis. This organism is oxidase-positive and can ferment both glucose and maltose, which aligns with option (D), providing a biochemical profile that helps identify the pathogen in laboratory settings.
Answer: (D) Oxidase-positive and ferments glucose and maltose

Question: A 34-year-old man is brought to a psychiatric hospital by friends for erratic behavior. He has been up for the past several nights painting his apartment walls purple and reading the Bible out loud, as well as talking fast and making sexually provocative comments. Collateral information from family reveals 2 similar episodes last year. Mental status exam is notable for labile affect and grandiose delusions. Urine toxicology is negative. The patient is admitted and started on lithium for mania. His symptoms resolve within 2 weeks. How should this patient’s lithium be managed in anticipation of discharge? (A) Continue lithium lifelong (D) Cross-taper lithium to valproic acid for maintenance therapy (E) Discontinue lithium, but re-start in the future if the patient has another manic episode (B) Continue lithium until a therapeutic serum lithium level is reached, then taper it (C) Cross-taper lithium to aripiprazole for maintenance therapy
Reason: The question describes a patient with a clear history of manic episodes, suggestive of a bipolar disorder diagnosis. Given that this is his third manic episode and the efficacy of lithium in treating his symptoms, ongoing maintenance treatment with lithium is warranted to prevent future episodes. Thus, continuing lithium lifelong is the most appropriate management strategy.
Answer: (A) Continue lithium lifelong

Question: A 35-year-old lactose intolerant man presents to the outpatient clinic with complaints of numbness and tingling in his fingers and toes for the past month. He also complains of pain in his calf muscles while sleeping; the pain is severe enough to wake him up in the middle of the night. He is a software engineer and spends most of his time indoors. He has been smoking a pack of cigarettes daily for the past 10 years and occasionally drinks wine with dinner. His current medication regimen includes as needed ibuprofen and calcium supplementation. He does not take any other multivitamins. On examination, his pulse rate is 74/min, blood pressure is 128/67 mm Hg, respiratory rate is 16/min, and temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F). He has tenderness in the proximal muscles of his upper and lower limbs. Sensory examination is normal. The rest of the physical examination is normal. X-ray imaging of his lower limbs shows features of demineralization. Which of the following sets of abnormalities are most likely occurring in this patient? (A) Low serum 25-OH D with low serum calcium levels (B) High serum 25-OH D levels with high serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels (E) High serum 25-OH D with high phosphate levels (D) Low serum 25-OH D with high serum calcium levels (C) Low alkaline phosphatase levels with low serum PTH levels
Reason: The patient's symptoms, including numbness, tingling, and muscle pain, along with the x-ray findings of demineralization, suggest a condition related to vitamin D deficiency, likely leading to osteomalacia. Given his lactose intolerance and limited sun exposure, he is at risk for low serum vitamin D levels, which would consequently lead to low serum calcium levels due to inadequate intestinal absorption, making option (A) the most appropriate choice.
Answer: (A) Low serum 25-OH D with low serum calcium levels

Question: A 60-year-old woman is brought into the office by his son. His son states that the patient has been acting inappropriately over the last few years. She has been taking off her clothes in front of visitors and putting objects in her mouth. She has had no emotional response to the death of one of her close friends and was laughing at her funeral. She has almost no memory issues, but sometimes forgets how to use objects such as a telephone. She has no other medical issues and takes no medications. On exam, she has no focal neurological deficits and her mini-mental status exam is 25/30. What is the most likely diagnosis? (A) Normal aging (C) Lewy body dementia (B) Alzheimer's dementia (D) Pick's disease (E) Vascular dementia
Reason: The patient's symptoms—including inappropriate social behavior, emotional blunting (e.g., laughing at a funeral), and difficulties with the use of objects—are characteristic of frontotemporal dementia, specifically Pick's disease. This condition typically presents with changes in personality and behavior rather than significant memory loss, which aligns with the patient's intact cognitive performance on the mini-mental status exam, reinforcing the conclusion that she is likely experiencing Pick's disease.
Answer: (D) Pick's disease

She just returned from a cruise trip to the Bahamas with her family 5 days ago and reports that she has been feeling ill since then. She endorses fever, productive cough, and general malaise. Her daughter also mentions that the patient has been having some diarrhea but reports that the rest of her family has been experiencing similar symptoms. Physical examination was significant for localized crackles at the right lower lobe. Laboratory findings are as follows:

Serum
Na+: 130 mEq/L
K+: 3.9 mEq/L
Cl-: 98 mEq/L
HCO3-: 27 mEq/L
Mg2+: 1.8 mEq/L

What findings would you expect in this patient? (D) Gram-negative on silver stain (E) Gram-positive diplococci on Gram stain (C) Gram-negative rod on chocolate agar with factors V and X (A) Broad-based budding on fungal sputum culture (B) High titers of cold agglutinins
Reason: The answer to the question is (D) Gram-negative on silver stain. This clinical scenario suggests a possible case of pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis jirovecii, a common pathogen in immunocompromised patients, which can be diagnosed using silver staining techniques. The patient's recent travel, fever, cough, and diarrhea, along with the presence of localized crackles, point towards a respiratory infection, and the silver stain is particularly useful for identifying this organism in respiratory samples.
Answer: (D) Gram-negative on silver stain

Question: A 24-year-old woman presents with blisters and erosions on her upper face, chest, and back. The blisters have erythema, scales, and crust formation. The lesions are aggravated, especially after sun exposure. Examination shows oromucosal involvement. Histopathologic evaluation reveals a tombstone arrangement at the base of the blister. What is the most likely cause for the patient’s condition? (C) Pemphigus foliaceus (E) Linear immunoglobulin A (IgA) disease (LAD) (D) Dermatitis herpetiformis (A) Pemphigus vulgaris (B) Bullous pemphigoid
Reason: The answer to the question is (A) Pemphigus vulgaris. This condition is characterized by the formation of painful blisters and erosions on the skin and mucous membranes, with histopathological findings showing a "tombstone" arrangement of the basal layer of the epidermis due to acantholysis. The involvement of oral mucosa and exacerbation of symptoms with sun exposure further supports the diagnosis of pemphigus vulgaris, as it is an autoimmune disorder that causes the body to attack the proteins that hold skin cells together.
Answer: (A) Pemphigus vulgaris

Question: Two days after undergoing emergency cardiac catherization for myocardial infarction, a 68-year-old woman has pain in her toes. During the intervention, she was found to have an occluded left anterior descending artery and 3 stents were placed. She has hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and coronary artery disease. Prior to admission, her medications were metoprolol, enalapril, atorvastatin, and aspirin. Her temperature is 37.3°C (99.1°F), pulse is 93/min, and blood pressure is 115/78 mm Hg. Examination shows discoloration of the toes of both feet. A photograph of the right foot is shown. The lesions are cool and tender to palpation. The rest of the skin on the feet is warm; femoral and pedal pulses are palpable bilaterally. This patient is at increased risk for which of the following conditions? (D) Permanent flexion contracture (C) Basophilia (B) Lipodermatosclerosis (E) Migratory thrombophlebitis (A) Acute kidney injury
Reason: The answer to the question is (A) Acute kidney injury. Following cardiac catheterization, the patient is displaying symptoms consistent with acute limb ischemia, indicated by the pain and discoloration in the toes, which can lead to renal complications. The use of stents and the presence of risk factors such as hypertension and hypercholesterolemia also suggest the potential for decreased renal perfusion and subsequent acute kidney injury, particularly if there is a significant reduction in blood flow due to embolization or systemic issues that may arise post-procedure.
Answer: (A) Acute kidney injury

Question: A 4-week-old male presents with his parents to the pediatrician for a well-child visit. The patient’s mother reports that the patient was eating well until about one week ago, when he began vomiting after breastfeeding. His mother has tried increasing the frequency of feeds and decreasing the amount of each feed, but the vomiting seems to be getting worse. The patient now vomits after every feed. His mother states the vomitus looks like breastmilk. The patient’s mother is exclusively breastfeeding and would prefer not to switch to formula but worries that the patient is not getting the nutrition he needs. Two weeks ago, the patient was in the 75th percentile for weight and 70th for height. He is now in the 60th percentile for weight and 68th percentile for height. On physical exam, the patient has dry mucous membranes. His abdomen is soft and non-distended.

Which of the following is the best next step in management? (C) Supplement breastfeeding with formula (B) Abdominal radiograph (A) Abdominal ultrasound (D) Trial of cow's milk-free diet (E) Trial of empiric proton pump inhibitor
Reason: The best next step in the management of this case is (A) abdominal ultrasound. Given the symptoms of persistent vomiting, especially in a 4-week-old infant, it is crucial to rule out potential anatomical abnormalities such as pyloric stenosis, which commonly presents with projectile vomiting and may require surgical intervention. An abdominal ultrasound is a non-invasive and effective tool for diagnosing such conditions in infants.
Answer: (A) Abdominal ultrasound

Question: A 67-year-old man presents to the surgical clinic with swelling of his right leg, fever, and chills for 2 days. The maximum recorded temperature was 38.3°C (101.0°F) at home. His right leg is red and swollen from the dorsum of the foot to the thigh with an ill-defined edge. Venous stasis ulcers are present in both of his limbs, but those on the right have a yellow discharge. His vitals include the following: blood pressure is 120/78 mm Hg, heart rate is 94/min, temperature is 38.3°C (101.0°F), and respiratory rate is 16/min. On physical examination, there is tenderness and warmth compared with his normal leg. Dorsalis pedis pulses are present on both of the ankles. What is the most likely cause of the right shift of the hemoglobin dissociation curve for his condition? (A) Increase in pH (B) Decrease in 2,3-DPG (D) Decrease in temperature (C) Increase in temperature (E) Increase in CO production
Reason: The most likely cause of the right shift of the hemoglobin dissociation curve in this case is (C) increase in temperature. A right shift in the hemoglobin dissociation curve indicates a decreased affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen, which can occur in conditions where there is increased metabolic activity, such as infection or inflammation. The patient presents with fever and swelling, indicating a likely inflammatory response that raises body temperature and promotes the release of oxygen to tissues.
Answer: (C) Increase in temperature

Echocardiography shows concentrically thickened ventricles with diastolic dysfunction. Skeletal survey shows no osteolytic lesions. Which of the following best explains these findings? (B) Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (D) Symptomatic multiple myeloma (C) Smoldering multiple myeloma (E) Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia (A) AL amyloidosis
Reason: The best explanation for these findings is (A) AL amyloidosis. The patient's symptoms of gradual leg and facial swelling, significant proteinuria, and heart changes consistent with diastolic dysfunction suggest the presence of amyloid deposits affecting the heart and kidneys. Additionally, the elevated levels of cholesterol and triglycerides, along with low albumin, are indicative of nephrotic syndrome, which can be associated with AL amyloidosis, often due to an underlying plasma cell disorder.
Answer: (A) AL amyloidosis

Question: A 31-year-old male traveler in Thailand experiences fever, headache, and excessive sweating every 48 hours. Peripheral blood smear shows trophozoites and schizonts indicative of Plasmodia infection. The patient is given chloroquine and primaquine. Primaquine targets which of the following Plasmodia forms: (E) Hypnozoite (C) Schizont (A) Merozoite (D) Sporozoite (B) Trophozoite
Reason: The answer is (E) Hypnozoite because primaquine is primarily effective against the dormant liver stage of certain Plasmodium species, particularly Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium ovale. These dormant forms are referred to as hypnozoites, which can cause relapses of malaria if not treated appropriately with primaquine after chloroquine has cleared the blood stages.

Question: A 2-year-old male is referred to a geneticist for developmental delay and intellectual disability. He was hypotonic at birth and his parents are concerned that he tries to eat everything, including erasers and chalk. Physical exam is remarkable for severe obesity and hypogonadism. Genetic analysis reveals that he has one mutated allele and one normal allele at the gene of interest. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for why this patient is affected despite having a normal allele? (E) X-linked inheritance pattern (B) Imprinting (D) Uniparental disomy (C) Locus heterogeneity (A) Autosomal dominant inheritance pattern
Reason: The answer is (B) Imprinting because the symptoms described, including developmental delay, intellectual disability, obesity, and hypogonadism, are characteristic of Prader-Willi syndrome, which is caused by the loss of function of paternal genes in a specific chromosomal region due to genomic imprinting. In this case, even though the patient has one normal allele, the imprinted (silenced) allele from the other parent leads to the clinical manifestation of the disorder, explaining why both alleles are not functioning normally.
Answer: (B) Imprinting

Question: A 65-year-old man with a history of diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and obesity is transferred from the cardiac catheterization lab to the cardiac critical care unit after sustaining a massive myocardial infarction. He received a bare metal stent and has now stabilized. However, shortly after being transferred, he reports palpitations. EKG reveals ventricular tachycardia. Your attending wishes to start an anti-arrhythmic drug with a high selectivity for ischemic cardiac myocytes. You call the nurse and ask her to begin intravenous: (E) Flecainide (A) Quinidine (D) Procainamide (C) Dofetilide (B) Lidocaine
Reason: The answer is (B) Lidocaine because it is an effective anti-arrhythmic agent that is particularly suited for patients with ischemic heart conditions, such as after a myocardial infarction. Lidocaine works by selectively targeting and stabilizing ischemic cardiac myocytes, which makes it useful in managing ventricular arrhythmias that may occur in these settings.

Question: A 72-year-old woman with hypertension comes to the physician because of swelling and pain in both legs for the past year. The symptoms are worse at night and improve in the morning. Current medications include losartan and metoprolol. Her temperature is 36°C (96.8°F), pulse is 67/min, and blood pressure is 142/88 mm Hg. Examination shows normal heart sounds; there is no jugular venous distention. Her abdomen is soft and the liver edge is not palpable. Examination of the lower extremities shows bilateral pitting edema and prominent superficial veins. The skin is warm and there is reddish-brown discoloration of both ankles. Laboratory studies show a normal serum creatinine and normal urinalysis. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms? (D) Increased venous valve reflux (C) Decreased arteriolar resistance (E) Increased capillary permeability (A) Decreased lymphatic flow (B) Decreased intravascular oncotic pressure
Reason: The patient in the scenario presents with bilateral pitting edema, prominent superficial veins, and symptoms that worsen at night and improve in the morning, which are characteristic features of chronic venous insufficiency. The reddish-brown discoloration at the ankles suggests hemosiderin deposition due to venous stasis, commonly caused by increased venous valve reflux. This indicates that the underlying issue is related to dysfunctional venous valves, leading to the observed symptoms.
Answer: (D) Increased venous valve reflux

Question: A 13-year-old boy has been suspended 5 times this year for arguing with teachers. He has presented a pattern of negativism and hostility that has lasted for about 8 months. When asked about the suspensions, he admits that he loses his temper easily and often blames the principal for not being fair to him. He usually finds an argument before finishing his homework. At home, he goes out of his way to annoy his siblings. He gets furious if his legal guardian finds out about it and confiscates his smartphone. Which of the following is an additional behavior characteristic of this patient’s most likely diagnosis? (E) Violating the rights of others (B) Hostile and disobedient behavior towards authority (C) Killing and/or harming small animals (A) Destruction of property and theft (D) Physical aggression
Reason: The boy's behaviors, including arguing with teachers and being consistently negative and hostile, fit the criteria for Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD), which is characterized by a pattern of angry, irritable mood, argumentative/defiant behavior, and vindictiveness. The additional behavior characteristic of this diagnosis, therefore, would include ongoing hostility and disobedience towards authority figures, reflecting the core features of ODD.

Question: A previously healthy 11-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department because of a 3-day history of fever, cough, and a runny nose. During this period, he has also had pink, itchy eyes. The patient emigrated from Syria 2 weeks ago. His parents died 6 months ago. He has not yet received any routine childhood vaccinations. He lives at a foster home with ten other refugees; two have similar symptoms. He appears anxious and is sweating. His temperature is 39.2°C (102.5°F), pulse is 100/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 125/75 mm Hg. Examination shows conjunctivitis of both eyes. There are multiple bluish-gray lesions on an erythematous background on the buccal mucosa and the soft palate. This patient is at increased risk for which of the following complications? (A) Aplastic crisis (C) Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (B) Coronary artery aneurysm (D) Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (E) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura
Reason: The boy's presentation, including fever, cough, conjunctivitis, and the characteristic bluish-gray lesions on the buccal mucosa known as Koplik spots, suggests a diagnosis of measles. One of the serious long-term complications of measles, particularly in children who are unimmunized, is subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), which can occur several years after the initial infection. Therefore, given that this patient has not received any vaccinations and has symptoms consistent with measles, he is at increased risk for this severe complication.

Question: A 23-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department by her boyfriend because of a 4-month history of feeling sad. Her boyfriend says that, during this period, she has slept and eaten very little and has been unable to focus at work. She says that she feels “empty inside” and has been hearing voices telling her that she is worthless. She first heard these voices 7 months ago when they started to make fun of her. She does not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. Physical and neurological examinations show no abnormalities. On mental status examination, her speech is slow and monotonous; she abruptly stops talking in the middle of sentences and does not finish them. She occasionally directs her attention to the ceiling as if she were listening to someone. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? (D) Mood disorder with psychotic features (E) Schizotypal personality disorder (A) Schizophrenia (C) Schizoaffective disorder (B) Schizophreniform disorder
Reason: The most likely diagnosis for the 23-year-old woman is (C) Schizoaffective disorder, as her symptoms exhibit both mood disturbances, including sadness, low appetite, and difficulty focusing, combined with psychotic features such as auditory hallucinations and disorganized speech. The presence of these characteristics alongside the significant mood symptoms supports Schizoaffective disorder, which involves the combination of schizophrenia and mood disorder symptoms.

Question: A 56-year-old woman presents to a physician for evaluation of a lump in her left breast. She noticed the lump last week while taking a shower. She says that the lump seemed to be getting larger, which worried her. The lump is not painful. The medical history is unremarkable. She has smoked cigarettes for the last 30 years. On examination, bilateral small nodules are present that are non-tender and immobile. A mammography confirms the masses and fine needle aspiration cytology of the lesions reveals malignant cells arranged in a row of cells. What is the most likely diagnosis?
  (A) Inflammatory carcinoma (E) Invasive lobular carcinoma (D) Invasive ductal carcinoma (B) Mucinous carcinoma (C) Fibroadenoma
Reason: Invasive lobular carcinoma is characterized by its unique cellular arrangement, often described as a single-file or "row" pattern of tumor cells, which aligns with the fine needle aspiration cytology findings in this case. Additionally, the non-tender, immobile nature of the bilateral nodules and the patient's age further support this diagnosis, as invasive lobular carcinoma typically occurs in postmenopausal women.

Question: A 44-year-old man presents to his primary care physician due to a shock-like pain in his left leg. He describes the pain as sharp and lasting a few minutes at a time. He has noticed being "clumsy" when walking in a dark room. Approximately 2 weeks ago, he was helping his daughter move and this required him to lift heavy boxes. He denies any trauma to the back or lower back pain. Medical history is significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He is currently sexually active and is in a monogamous relationship with his wife. Approximately 15 years ago, he noted a painless genital lesion. On physical exam, there is a miotic pupil that does not constrict with light but constricts with convergence and accommodation. Strength, reflex, and sensory exam of the lower extremity is unremarkable. The patient has a positive Romberg test. Which of the following is most likely the cause of this patient's symptoms? (A) Acute ischemic cerebellar stroke (C) Lumbar disc herniation (D) Lumbar spinal stenosis (E) Sexually transmitted infection (B) Diabetic peripheral neuropathy
Reason: The patient's history of a painless genital lesion approximately 15 years ago raises the suspicion for a sexually transmitted infection (STI), specifically syphilis, which can have long-term neurological complications such as tabes dorsalis. Additionally, the combination of shock-like leg pain, clumsiness in the dark, and the presence of a miotic pupil that does not react to light suggests involvement of the nervous system, which could be linked to an untreated or chronic STI that has progressed to affect neurological structures.

Question: A 47-year-old woman presents to a local medical shelter while on a mission trip with her church to help rebuild homes after a hurricane. She has been experiencing severe nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea for the last 2 days and was feeling too fatigued to walk this morning. On presentation, her temperature is 99.2°F (37.3°C), blood pressure is 95/62 mmHg, pulse is 121/min, and respirations are 17/min. Physical exam reveals decreased skin turgor, and a stool sample reveals off-white watery stools. Gram stain reveals a gram-negative, comma-shaped organism that produces a toxin. Which of the following is consistent with the action of the toxin most likely involved in the development of this patient's symptoms? (A) Activation of receptor tyrosine kinase (C) Decreased ribosomal activity (E) Increased membrane permeability (D) Increased adenylyl cyclase activity (B) Cleavage of junctional proteins
Reason: The action of the toxin most likely involved in this patient's symptoms is consistent with increased adenylyl cyclase activity, as this is a mechanism associated with the cholera toxin, produced by the organism Vibrio cholerae. The toxin activates adenylyl cyclase, leading to elevated levels of cyclic AMP (cAMP), which causes excessive secretion of electrolytes and water into the intestinal lumen, resulting in the profuse watery diarrhea observed in this patient.
Answer: (D) Increased adenylyl cyclase activity
[INFO] Sampling path 10 completed.
[INFO] Opinion paths:
Path 1: Let's analyze the clinical scenario step by step:

1. **Mechanism of Injury**: The patient was involved in a high-speed motor vehicle collision, which typically suggests significant trauma.

2. **Clinical Presentation**:
   - **Lethargy and incoherence** indicate possible altered mental status, likely due to hypoxia or shock.
   - **Respiratory distress** with a pulse of 130/min and blood pressure of 90/58 mm Hg suggests hypovolemic shock or another severe respiratory issue.
   - **Oxygen saturation of 70%** indicates severe hypoxia.

3. **Physical Examination Findings**:
   - **Dullness to percussion and decreased breath sounds** over the left lung base suggest fluid or air in the pleural space.
   - **Facial lacerations** might suggest significant trauma to the thoracic area, potentially involving the airway.
   - **Abdominal tenderness without guarding or rebound** could indicate internal bleeding or solid organ injury, but not necessarily acute abdomen.

4. **Imaging Findings**:
   - **Fractured left second rib** can indicate underlying lung or vascular injury.
   - **Depression of the left mainstem bronchus** suggests a significant injury to the airway.
   - **Deviation of the nasogastric tube to the right** can indicate a mediastinal shift, which can occur in conditions like tension pneumothorax or aortic rupture.
   - **Widened mediastinum** is particularly concerning for thoracic aortic injury.

5. **Differential Diagnosis**:
   - **Tension pneumothorax (E)**: This would typically cause tracheal deviation and respiratory distress, but the imaging findings and rib fracture suggest a more severe injury.
   - **Diaphragmatic rupture (A)**: Could cause respiratory distress, but the imaging findings are more indicative of vascular injury.
   - **Cardiac tamponade (D)**: Would typically show signs of shock and muffled heart sounds, which are not mentioned here.
   - **Traumatic bronchial rupture (B)**: Could cause respiratory distress and altered breath sounds but wouldn’t typically cause such significant mediastinal widening.
   - **Thoracic aortic rupture (C)**: The combination of a widened mediastinum, rib fracture, and signs of shock can indicate this severe condition.

Based on the above reasoning, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is:

**Answer: (C) Thoracic aortic rupture**
Path 2: Let's think through the question step by step:

The 26-year-old woman has been in a high-speed motor vehicle collision, which raises the suspicion for significant thoracic injuries. Key findings from the case include:

1. **Respiratory Distress**: She is in respiratory distress and has decreased oxygen saturation (70%).
2. **Physical Exam Findings**: Dullness to percussion and decreased breath sounds over the left lung base suggest fluid in the pleural space, which could be blood (hemothorax) or other fluid.
3. **X-ray Findings**: The chest x-ray shows:
   - A fractured left second rib.
   - Depression of the left mainstem bronchus.
   - Deviation of the nasogastric tube to the right (this could indicate mediastinal shift).
   - A widened mediastinum, which is a classic sign of possible aortic injury.

Given these findings:

- **Tension Pneumothorax** (E) usually presents with tracheal deviation and hyper-resonance, which is not specifically mentioned here.
- **Diaphragmatic Rupture** (A) could cause respiratory distress but is less likely given the mediastinal shift and rib fracture.
- **Cardiac Tamponade** (D) is characterized by muffled heart sounds, jugular venous distention, and hypotension, which are not specifically noted here.
- **Traumatic Bronchial Rupture** (B) could also cause respiratory distress and could be associated with rib fractures, but the mediastinal widening is more indicative of aortic injury.
- **Thoracic Aortic Rupture** (C) is suggested by the widened mediastinum and could explain the respiratory distress and hypotension.

Given the combination of the mechanism of injury, the widened mediastinum, and the rib fracture, the most likely diagnosis is:

**Answer: (C) Thoracic aortic rupture**.
Path 3: Let's analyze the scenario step by step.

1. **Patient Presentation**: The 26-year-old woman has been in a high-speed motor vehicle collision and presents with lethargy, incoherence, respiratory distress, tachycardia, hypotension, and low oxygen saturation.

2. **Physical Examination**: She has severe facial lacerations, dullness to percussion, and decreased breath sounds over the left lung base. Her abdominal exam shows diffuse tenderness without guarding or rebound.

3. **Chest X-ray Findings**: The x-ray shows a fractured left second rib, depression of the left mainstem bronchus, deviation of the nasogastric tube to the right, and a widened mediastinum, which is a critical finding.

4. **Differential Diagnosis**:
   - **A) Diaphragmatic rupture**: Would typically present with bowel sounds in the thorax, but we do not have this information explicitly.
   - **B) Traumatic bronchial rupture**: Would present with respiratory distress and possibly subcutaneous emphysema, but the x-ray findings do not specifically support this.
   - **C) Thoracic aortic rupture**: The widened mediastinum and symptoms of shock could indicate this, but the specific findings on the x-ray do not strongly suggest it.
   - **D) Cardiac tamponade**: This typically would present with signs of shock and could cause decreased breath sounds due to cardiac compression, but the x-ray findings do not support this diagnosis.
   - **E) Tension pneumothorax**: Would present with dullness to percussion and decreased breath sounds, but typically would show signs such as mediastinal shift and hyper-resonance on percussion.

5. **Conclusion**: The combination of a widened mediastinum, rib fracture, and depression of the left mainstem bronchus suggests trauma to the thoracic aorta, especially given the mechanism of injury and the significant respiratory distress and hypotension.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis given the evidence presented is:

**Answer: (C) Thoracic aortic rupture**
Path 4: Let's analyze the clinical scenario step by step:

1. **Mechanism of Injury**: The patient was involved in a high-speed motor vehicle collision, which can lead to significant blunt thoracic trauma.

2. **Vital Signs**: The patient is lethargic, incoherent, has tachycardia (pulse 130/min), tachypnea (respirations 29/min), and hypotension (blood pressure 90/58 mm Hg). These signs indicate possible shock, likely from significant blood loss or compromised circulation.

3. **Respiratory Status**: The patient has severe respiratory distress and an oxygen saturation of 70%, which is critically low.

4. **Physical Examination Findings**:
   - **Dullness to percussion and decreased breath sounds over the left lung base**: This suggests fluid accumulation (possibly hemothorax) or significant lung collapse (pneumothorax).
   - **Facial lacerations**: Indicate facial trauma, which can sometimes accompany significant thoracic injury.
   - **Abdominal tenderness with normal bowel sounds**: While there is tenderness, the absence of guarding or rebound tenderness might suggest that the abdomen is not the primary source of acute distress.

5. **Imaging Findings**:
   - **Fractured left second rib**: Rib fractures can be associated with thoracic vascular injuries, particularly in the context of high-speed trauma.
   - **Depression of the left mainstem bronchus**: This finding is concerning for possible bronchial injury.
   - **Deviation of the nasogastric tube to the right**: This can indicate a mediastinal shift, often due to fluid or air in the thoracic cavity.
   - **Widened mediastinum**: This is a classic sign that can indicate a thoracic aortic injury or other vascular injury.

Given all these findings, particularly the combination of a widened mediastinum, rib fracture, and the history of high-speed trauma, the most likely diagnosis is:

**(C) Thoracic aortic rupture**. 

This condition is often associated with a high mechanism of injury, rib fractures, and mediastinal widening on chest x-ray, and it can lead to rapid hemodynamic instability, which fits this patient's presentation.
Path 5: Let's analyze the clinical scenario step by step:

1. **Mechanism of Injury**: The patient was involved in a high-speed motor vehicle collision, which typically suggests significant blunt trauma to the chest and abdomen.

2. **Clinical Signs**: 
   - The patient is lethargic and incoherent, indicating possible hypoxia or shock.
   - She exhibits respiratory distress and has a low oxygen saturation of 70%, which suggests inadequate oxygenation likely due to a pulmonary issue.
   - Decreased breath sounds and dullness to percussion over the left lung base suggest fluid accumulation (e.g., blood or pleural effusion) in that area.

3. **Vital Signs**: The elevated pulse (130/min) and low blood pressure (90/58 mm Hg) are indicative of shock, likely hypovolemic given the circumstances.

4. **Chest X-ray Findings**: 
   - Fractured left second rib and depression of the left mainstem bronchus are significant findings that could indicate major thoracic injury.
   - Deviation of the nasogastric tube to the right may suggest mediastinal shift, which can occur with significant injury or bleeding.
   - Widened mediastinum is a classic sign associated with thoracic aortic injury.

5. **Differential Diagnosis**:
   - **Thoracic aortic rupture**: The presence of a widened mediastinum on chest X-ray along with the mechanism of injury strongly points towards this diagnosis. 
   - **Tension pneumothorax**: Could cause respiratory distress, but typically would show tracheal deviation and hyperresonance, which is not mentioned.
   - **Diaphragmatic rupture**: May cause respiratory distress and bowel sounds in the thorax, but less likely with the specific findings here.
   - **Cardiac tamponade**: Would lead to signs of shock and muffled heart sounds, but the mediastinal widening is more specific to aortic injury.
   - **Traumatic bronchial rupture**: Would likely present with significant respiratory distress and potentially subcutaneous emphysema, but the mediastinal and rib findings are more suggestive of aortic injury.

Given the combination of the mechanism of injury, vital signs suggestive of shock, the specific findings on the chest X-ray, and the clinical presentation, the most likely diagnosis is:

**Answer: (C) Thoracic aortic rupture**.
Path 6: Let's analyze the case step by step to determine the most likely diagnosis:

1. **Mechanism of Injury**: The patient was involved in a high-speed motor vehicle collision, which suggests significant trauma.

2. **Vital Signs and Symptoms**: The patient is lethargic, incoherent, has respiratory distress, tachycardia (pulse of 130/min), hypotension (blood pressure of 90/58 mm Hg), and severely low oxygen saturation (70%).

3. **Physical Exam Findings**: 
   - Dullness to percussion and decreased breath sounds over the left lung base suggest the presence of fluid or possibly air in the pleural space.
   - Abdominal examination shows diffuse tenderness but no guarding or rebound, indicating that while there is some abdominal injury, there may not be an acute surgical abdomen.

4. **Imaging Results**: 
   - The chest x-ray shows a fractured left second rib, depression of the left mainstem bronchus, deviation of the nasogastric tube to the right, and a widened mediastinum.

5. **Key Signs**: 
   - The widened mediastinum and rib fracture raise suspicion for vascular injury, particularly to the aorta.
   - The depression of the left mainstem bronchus and deviation of the nasogastric tube may suggest mediastinal shift or other significant thoracic injuries.

Given the combination of the mechanism of injury, vital signs indicating shock, respiratory distress, and the specific imaging findings (especially the widened mediastinum and rib fracture), the most likely diagnosis is:

**(C) Thoracic aortic rupture** 

This condition is often associated with high-speed trauma and is characterized by a widened mediastinum on chest x-ray, along with signs of respiratory distress and shock.
Path 7: Let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. **Patient Presentation**: The patient is a 26-year-old woman involved in a high-speed motor vehicle collision. She is lethargic, incoherent, in respiratory distress, and has facial lacerations. 

2. **Vital Signs**: Her pulse is elevated (130/min), indicating tachycardia, and her blood pressure is low (90/58 mm Hg), suggesting possible shock. Her oxygen saturation is critically low at 70%, indicating significant respiratory distress.

3. **Physical Exam Findings**: There is dullness to percussion and decreased breath sounds over the left lung base, which can indicate fluid or air accumulation in the pleural space. The abdominal examination shows diffuse tenderness but no guarding or rebound, which is important to rule out acute abdominal conditions.

4. **X-ray Findings**: The chest x-ray reveals:
   - A fractured left second rib
   - Depression of the left mainstem bronchus
   - Deviation of the nasogastric tube to the right
   - Widened mediastinum

5. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **(C) Thoracic aortic rupture**: This could explain the widened mediastinum, but it usually presents with rapid deterioration and is often fatal quickly.
   - **(E) Tension pneumothorax**: This typically presents with acute respiratory distress and hypotension but would show tracheal deviation towards the affected side rather than away, and there would be hyper-resonance on percussion, not dullness.
   - **(A) Diaphragmatic rupture**: Could cause respiratory distress and may lead to bowel sounds in the thorax, but the key indicators (like the rib fracture and bronchus depression) are not typical.
   - **(D) Cardiac tamponade**: Would lead to signs of shock and potentially muffled heart sounds, but the respiratory findings and the context of a motor vehicle accident suggest otherwise.
   - **(B) Traumatic bronchial rupture**: This can occur with rib fractures, especially with a fracture of the second rib near the bronchial tree. Symptoms include respiratory distress and could correspond with the low oxygen saturation and physical exam findings.

Given the mechanism of injury, the x-ray findings, and the clinical presentation, the most likely diagnosis is:

**Answer: (B) Traumatic bronchial rupture**.
Path 8: To determine the most likely diagnosis for the 26-year-old woman involved in a high-speed motor vehicle collision, we need to analyze her symptoms and the findings from the examination and imaging.

1. **Vital Signs and Symptoms**: She is lethargic, incoherent, in respiratory distress, tachycardic (pulse of 130/min), and hypotensive (blood pressure of 90/58 mm Hg). Her oxygen saturation is critically low at 70%.

2. **Physical Examination**: There are multiple facial lacerations, dullness to percussion, and decreased breath sounds over the left lung base. Abdominal examination shows diffuse tenderness without guarding or rebound tenderness, indicating possible internal injury.

3. **Chest X-ray Findings**: The chest X-ray shows:
   - Fractured left second rib
   - Depression of the left mainstem bronchus
   - Deviation of the nasogastric tube to the right (suggesting possible mediastinal shift)
   - Widened mediastinum

Given these findings, especially the combination of respiratory distress, hypotension, and the chest X-ray findings with a widened mediastinum, the most likely diagnosis is:

**(C) Thoracic aortic rupture.**

Thoracic aortic rupture is often associated with high-speed collisions and can cause rapid deterioration in the patient's hemodynamic status, leading to hypotension and respiratory distress due to hemorrhage and mediastinal structures' displacement. 

Thus, the answer is: **(C) Thoracic aortic rupture.**
Path 9: Let's analyze the clinical scenario step by step:

1. **Mechanism of Injury**: The patient was involved in a high-speed motor vehicle collision, which raises the suspicion for significant blunt thoracic trauma.

2. **Vital Signs**: The patient is lethargic and incoherent, indicating altered mental status, and shows signs of hypovolemic shock with tachycardia (pulse of 130/min) and hypotension (blood pressure of 90/58 mm Hg). 

3. **Respiratory Distress**: Respiratory distress, along with an oxygen saturation of 70%, suggests a severe respiratory compromise.

4. **Physical Examination Findings**: 
   - Dullness to percussion and decreased breath sounds over the left lung base suggest possible pleural effusion or hemothorax.
   - The abdominal examination shows diffuse tenderness but no guarding or rebound, which points away from acute intra-abdominal pathology.

5. **Imaging Findings**: The chest x-ray reveals:
   - A fractured left second rib, which can be associated with lung injury or vascular injury.
   - Depression of the left mainstem bronchus, which is concerning for bronchial injury.
   - Deviation of the nasogastric tube to the right, which is indicative of mediastinal shift.
   - A widened mediastinum, which is a classic sign of potential vascular injury, particularly involving the aorta.

Considering all of the above findings, the most likely diagnosis is:

**(C) Thoracic aortic rupture.**

This is supported by the combination of the mechanism of injury (high-speed impact), the presence of rib fractures, mediastinal widening, and the clinical manifestation of shock and respiratory distress.
Path 10: Let's analyze the situation step by step. The patient is a 26-year-old woman who has been involved in a high-speed motor vehicle collision and presents with significant respiratory distress, altered mental status, hypotension, and physical findings that include dullness to percussion and decreased breath sounds on the left side.

Key findings from the examination and imaging include:
- Severe respiratory distress and an oxygen saturation of 70%.
- Dullness to percussion and decreased breath sounds over the left lung base, suggesting fluid accumulation.
- A fractured left second rib and depression of the left mainstem bronchus.
- Deviation of the nasogastric tube to the right and a widened mediastinum on chest X-ray.

The combination of these findings is highly suggestive of a significant injury in the thoracic region. The widened mediastinum and rib fracture raise suspicion for potential vascular injury.

Given the findings of respiratory distress, hypotension, and the presence of a widened mediastinum, the most likely diagnosis is a **thoracic aortic rupture (C)**. This condition commonly occurs in high-speed motor vehicle collisions and can lead to rapid hemodynamic instability due to significant blood loss into the thoracic cavity.

Therefore, the answer is:
**(C) Thoracic aortic rupture.**

Question: A 39-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 5-month history of episodic retrosternal chest pain. She currently feels well. The pain is unrelated to exercise and does not radiate. The episodes typically last less than 15 minutes and lead to feelings of anxiety; resting relieves the pain. She has not had dyspnea or cough. She has hyperlipidemia treated with simvastatin. She does not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 104/min, respirations are 17/min, and blood pressure is 124/76 mm Hg. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. An ECG shows sinus tachycardia. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the evaluation of coronary artery disease in this patient? (B) Nuclear exercise stress test (E) Dobutamine stress echocardiography (C) Troponin I measurement (A) Coronary CT angiogram (D) No further testing needed
Reason: The answer is D) No further testing needed because the patient's episodic chest pain, characterized by its brief duration, relief with rest, and absence of other alarming symptoms (such as dyspnea or radiation of pain), suggests a low likelihood of significant coronary artery disease. Additionally, she does not exhibit risk factors (such as smoking or high blood pressure) that would typically necessitate further diagnostic evaluations. Given her overall presentation, the symptoms are likely non-cardiac in nature, and further testing may not provide additional clinical benefit.
Answer: (D) No further testing needed

Question: A 50-year-old man presents to an ophthalmologist with progressive decrease in his visual acuity over the last 6 months. He also mentions that he has become excessively sensitive to light over the same duration. Past medical history is significant for schizophrenia diagnosed in early adulthood which has been managed with an antipsychotic medication for the past 20 years. The ophthalmologist performs a slit lamp examination and notes discrete brown deposits on the corneal epithelium in both eyes. Which of the following antipsychotic drugs has this patient most likely been taking? (D) Thioridazine (A) Chlorpromazine (C) Haloperidol (E) Ziprasidone (B) Clozapine
Reason: The answer is A) Chlorpromazine because this antipsychotic medication is known to cause corneal deposits due to its association with oculogyric crisis and other ocular side effects. The presence of discrete brown deposits on the corneal epithelium, along with symptoms of decreased visual acuity and light sensitivity, suggests a possible corneal response to long-term use of Chlorpromazine, reflecting its known ocular toxicity.
Answer: (A) Chlorpromazine

Question: A 28-year-old man presents to his primary care provider because of shortness of breath, cough, and wheezing. He reports that in high school, he occasionally had shortness of breath and would wheeze after running. His symptoms have progressively worsened over the past 6 months and are now occurring daily. He also finds himself being woken up from sleep by his wheeze approximately 3 times a week. His medical history is unremarkable. He denies tobacco use or excessive alcohol consumption. His temperature is 37.1°C (98.8°F), blood pressure is 121/82 mm Hg, and heart rate is 82/min. Physical examination is remarkable for expiratory wheezing bilaterally. Spirometry shows an FEV1 of 73% of predicted, which improves by 19% with albuterol. In addition to a short-acting beta-agonist as needed, which of the following is the most appropriate therapy for this patient? (A) A low-dose inhaled corticosteroid alone (B) A long-acting beta-agonist alone (C) A low-dose inhaled corticosteroid and a long-acting beta-agonist (E) A high-dose inhaled corticosteroid and a long-acting beta-agonist (D) A medium-dose inhaled corticosteroid and a long-acting beta-agonist
Reason: The answer is C) A low-dose inhaled corticosteroid and a long-acting beta-agonist because the patient's symptoms and spirometry findings indicate moderate persistent asthma, characterized by daily symptoms and nighttime awakenings. Using a combination of a low-dose inhaled corticosteroid helps control inflammation, while a long-acting beta-agonist provides prolonged bronchodilation, effectively managing both airway inflammation and symptoms in this patient.
Answer: (C) A low-dose inhaled corticosteroid and a long-acting beta-agonist

Question: A 40-year-old male is brought into the emergency department as the unrestrained passenger in a motor vehicle collision. On presentation he is obtunded with multiple ecchymoses on his chest and abdomen. There is marked distortion of his left lower extremity. His blood pressure is 90/64 mmHg, pulse is 130/min, and respirations are 24/min. Physical exam is limited by the patient’s mental state. The patient appears to be in pain while breathing and has tenderness to palpation of the abdomen. Neck veins are distended. Auscultation of the lungs reveals absent breath sounds on the left and hyperresonance to percussion. An emergent procedure is done and the patient improves. Had a chest radiograph of the patient been obtained on presentation to the ED, which of the following findings would most likely have been seen? (D) Tracheal deviation to the left (E) Tracheal deviation to the right (C) Collection of fluid in the left lung base (B) Bilateral fluffy infiltrates at the lung bases (A) Consolidation of the left lower lobe
Reason: The correct answer is (E) Tracheal deviation to the right. In this scenario, the patient likely has a left-sided tension pneumothorax, which occurs when air becomes trapped in the pleural space and increases pressure, leading to a shift of the mediastinum and trachea to the opposite side (right). This deviation is a compensatory mechanism as the pressure on the left side pushes structures away from it.
Answer: (E) Tracheal deviation to the right

Question: A 58-year-old woman presents to the physician with a cough that began 6 years ago, as well as intermittent difficulty in breathing for the last year. There is no significant sputum production. There is no history of rhinorrhea, sneezing or nose congestion. She has been a chronic smoker from early adulthood. Her temperature is 36.9°C (98.4°F), the heart rate is 80/min, the blood pressure is 128/84 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate is 22/min. A physical examination reveals diffuse end-expiratory wheezing with prolonged expiration on chest auscultation; breath sounds and heart sounds are diminished. There is no cyanosis, clubbing or lymphadenopathy. Her chest radiogram shows hyperinflated lungs bilaterally and a computed tomography scan of her chest is shown in the picture. Which of the following best describes the pathogenesis of the condition of this patient? (E) Activation of histone deacetylase-2 (C) Structural cell death mediated by Rtp801 (B) Increased release of matrix metalloproteinase 12 (MMP-12) by neutrophils (D) Depletion of the periciliary fluid layer in airway cells (A) Infiltration of the lower airway mucosa by activated eosinophils and T lymphocytes
Reason: The correct answer is (C) Structural cell death mediated by Rtp801. In the context of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), particularly in smokers, Rtp801 has been implicated in the processes leading to cell death and tissue damage in the lungs, contributing to the structural changes observed in the airways and alveoli, which ultimately leads to symptoms like wheezing and dyspnea over time. This aligns with the chronic nature of the patient’s respiratory symptoms and the observed hyperinflation of the lungs on imaging.
Answer: (C) Structural cell death mediated by Rtp801

Question: A 56-year-old man with substernal chest pain calls 911. When paramedics arrive, they administer drug X sublingually for the immediate relief of angina. What is the most likely site of action of drug X? (A) Large arteries (E) Pulmonary arteries (D) Cardiac muscle (C) Arterioles (B) Large veins
Reason: The correct answer is (B) Large veins. Drug X, which is likely a nitrate such as nitroglycerin, primarily acts by causing vasodilation of the large veins, leading to a reduction in preload (the volume of blood returning to the heart). This effect helps alleviate angina by decreasing the workload on the heart and reducing myocardial oxygen demand.
Answer: (B) Large veins

Question: A 20-year-old man comes to the physician because of dark urine and decreased urine output for 2 days. He had a skin infection that required antibiotic treatment 3 weeks ago but stopped the antibiotics early because the infection had resolved. His blood pressure is 140/90 mm Hg. Physical examination shows periorbital edema bilaterally. A photomicrograph of a renal biopsy specimen is shown. Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following findings? (D) Decreased platelet count (E) Elevated Anti-DNase B titer (B) Impaired glutathione regeneration (A) Mutation in type IV collagen (C) Mesangial IgA deposition
Reason: The correct answer is (E) Elevated Anti-DNase B titer. 

This patient's symptoms and history suggest post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, which can occur after a streptococcal infection of the skin or throat. Elevated Anti-DNase B titers are commonly associated with recent streptococcal infections, indicating an immune response to the streptococcal antigens that may lead to the observed renal symptoms.
Answer: (E) Elevated Anti-DNase B titer

Question: A 9-year-old girl is brought to the pediatrician by her mother who reports that the girl has been complaining of genital itching over the past few days. She states she has noticed her daughter scratching her buttocks and anus for the past week; however, now she is scratching her groin quite profusely as well. The mother notices that symptoms seem to be worse at night. The girl is otherwise healthy, is up to date on her vaccinations, and feels well. She was recently treated with amoxicillin for a middle ear infection. The child also had a recent bought of diarrhea that was profuse and watery that seems to be improving. Her temperature is 98.5°F (36.9°C), blood pressure is 111/70 mmHg, pulse is 83/min, respirations are 16/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for excoriations over the girl's anus and near her vagina. Which of the following is the most likely infectious etiology? (A) Candida albicans (E) Herpes simplex virus (C) Gardnerella vaginalis (B) Enterobius vermicularis (D) Giardia lamblia
Reason: The correct answer is (B) Enterobius vermicularis. 

The clinical presentation of genital itching, scratching around the anal area, and worsening symptoms at night are classic signs of pinworm infection, which is caused by Enterobius vermicularis. The fact that the child also had a recent history of diarrhea, which can sometimes be associated with this intestinal parasite, further supports this diagnosis.
Answer: (B) Enterobius vermicularis

Question: A 20-year-old premedical student travels abroad for a global health service semester and presents to the local clinic with palpitations. She initially dismissed these symptoms as a side effect of working too hard; however, she has been noticing that these episodes have increased in frequency. Otherwise, she has had headaches and episodes of sweating, but she says that many members of her family have migraines. In the clinic, her temperature is 99°F (37°C), blood pressure is 170/120 mmHg, pulse is 105/min, respirations are 20/min. Other laboratory testing is not available. The doctor provides an older medication that he says does not bind to the relevant receptor but instead blocks an upstream process. The drug provided most likely has which of the following mechanisms of action? (D) Inhibition of vesicular transporters (A) Cleavage of vesicular SNAP proteins (B) Inhibition of metabolite conversion (C) Inhibition of reuptake pathways (E) Replacement of vesicular contents
Reason: The correct answer is (B) Inhibition of metabolite conversion. 

In this clinical scenario, the patient's symptoms, including palpitations, headaches, and hypertension, suggest the possibility of a catecholamine-secreting tumor, such as a pheochromocytoma. The older medication mentioned may be acting by inhibiting the conversion of metabolites involved in catecholamine synthesis or metabolism, thereby helping to manage the symptoms associated with elevated catecholamines.
Answer: (B) Inhibition of metabolite conversion

Question: A 7-day-old female newborn is brought to the physician because of lethargy, vomiting, poor feeding, and diarrhea for 4 days. She was born at 39 weeks' gestation. Vital signs are within normal limits. Bilateral cataracts and icterus are present. Examination shows jaundice of the skin, and the liver is palpated 5-cm below the right costal margin. Muscle tone is decreased in all extremities. Serum glucose concentration is 40 mg/dL. Which of the following metabolites is most likely to be increased in this patient? (A) Sphingomyelin (C) Branched-chain amino acids (B) Uric acid (E) Limit dextrins (D) Galactose-1-phosphate
Reason: The newborn's symptoms, including bilateral cataracts and hepatomegaly, are suggestive of galactosemia, a disorder in which the body cannot properly metabolize galactose due to a deficiency of the enzyme galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase. As a result, galactose-1-phosphate accumulates in the body, leading to the clinical manifestations observed.
Answer: (D) Galactose-1-phosphate

Question: Three days after being admitted to the hospital for an appendectomy, a 69-year-old woman develops cough and dyspnea. The cough is productive of small amounts of green sputum. Her temperature is 39.0°C (102.2°F), pulse is 107/min, respirations are 31/min, and blood pressure is 89/68 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 87%. Pulmonary examination shows diffuse crackles and rhonchi. An X-ray of the chest shows a left upper-lobe infiltrate of the lung. Two sets of blood cultures are obtained. While waiting for the results of the blood cultures, which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy? (E) Ertapenem and gentamicin (B) Azithromycin and ceftriaxone (A) Amoxicillin-clavulanate and clarithromycin (C) Cefepime and vancomycin (D) Colistin
Reason: The patient is showing signs of a serious pneumonia with significant respiratory distress, fever, and low blood pressure, suggesting a possible severe infection like pneumonia, which could be caused by multidrug-resistant organisms. Cefepime is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin effective against gram-negative bacteria, while vancomycin provides coverage against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), making this combination appropriate for empiric therapy while waiting for culture results.

Question: A 9-month-old infant is brought the pediatrician for immunizations and assessment. His parents report that he is eating well and produces several wet diapers every day. He is a happy and curious child. The boy was born at 39 weeks gestation via spontaneous vaginal delivery. He is up to date on all vaccines and is meeting all developmental milestones. The infant’s vital signs are normal. Physical growth is appropriate for his age. The physician notes a loud holosystolic murmur at the left sternal border (grade IV) and orders an echocardiogram which confirms the diagnosis of congenital heart defect. Based on echocardiogram findings, the pediatrician reassures the parents that the infant will be monitored, but most likely will not require surgical intervention. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? (B) Ventricular septal defect (A) Atrial septal defect (D) Tetralogy of Fallot (C) Coarctation of aorta (E) Patent ductus arteriosus
Reason: The most likely diagnosis is (B) Ventricular septal defect because a holosystolic murmur at the left sternal border is characteristic of this condition, indicating an abnormal flow of blood from the left ventricle to the right ventricle during systole. Additionally, ventricular septal defects are often asymptomatic and may not require surgical intervention, aligning with the pediatrician's reassurance about monitoring instead of immediate surgery.

Question: A 32-year-old woman comes to the office for a regular follow-up. She was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus 4 years ago. Her last blood test showed a fasting blood glucose level of 6.6 mmol/L (118.9 mg/dL) and HbA1c of 5.1%. No other significant past medical history. Current medications are metformin and a daily multivitamin. No significant family history. The physician wants to take her blood pressure measurements, but the patient states that she measures it every day in the morning and in the evening and even shows him a blood pressure diary with all the measurements being within normal limits. Which of the following statements is correct? (E) Assessment of blood pressure only needs to be done at the initial visit; it is not necessary to measure blood pressure in this patient at any follow-up appointments. (C) The physician has to measure the patient’s blood pressure because it is a standard of care for any person with diabetes mellitus who presents for a check-up. (B) The physician should not measure the blood pressure in this patient because she does not have hypertension or risk factors for hypertension. (A) The physician should not measure the blood pressure in this patient and should simply make a note in a record showing the results from the patient’s diary. (D) The physician should not measure the blood pressure in this patient because the local standards of care in the physician’s office differ from the national standards of care so measurements of this patient’s blood pressure can not be compared to diabet
Reason: It is standard practice to measure blood pressure at regular follow-up appointments for patients with diabetes, as they are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease and hypertension. Even if the patient has consistently normal readings at home, measuring blood pressure in the clinical setting is essential for comprehensive care and to ensure proper monitoring of any potential changes in her condition.
Answer: (C) The physician has to measure the patient’s blood pressure because it is a standard of care for any person with diabetes mellitus who presents for a check-up.

Question: A 73-year-old female is hospitalized following a pelvic fracture. She undergoes surgical repair without complication. Four days into her hospital stay, she develops acute dyspnea and chest pain accompanied by oxyhemoglobin desaturation. Which of the following arterial blood gas values is the patient most likely to have? (normal values: pH 7.35 - 7.45, PaO2 80 - 100 mm Hg, PaCO2 35-45 mm Hg, HCO3 22-26) (A) pH 7.5, PaO2 60, PaCO2 30, HCO3 22 (D) pH 7.3, PaO2 60, PaCO2 50, HCO3 24 (B) pH 7.3, PaO2 60, PaCO2 30, HCO3 20 (E) pH 7.4, PaO2 60, PaCO2 40, HCO3 24 (C) pH 7.5, PaO2 60, PaCO2 50, HCO3 28
Reason: The correct answer is (A) pH 7.5, PaO2 60, PaCO2 30, HCO3 22.

The presentation of acute dyspnea and chest pain after surgery raises suspicion for a pulmonary embolism or acute respiratory distress, which could lead to hypoxemia indicated by the low PaO2 of 60 mm Hg. The alkaline pH of 7.5 and low PaCO2 of 30 suggest respiratory alkalosis, which can occur due to hyperventilation as the patient attempts to compensate for the low oxygen levels, thus linking the arterial blood gas values to the patient’s acute respiratory distress.
Answer: (A) pH 7.5, PaO2 60, PaCO2 30, HCO3 22

[INFO] Opinion paths:
Path 1: Let's analyze the situation step by step.

1. **Patient History and Symptoms**: The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of myocardial infarction, presenting with dyspnea on exertion and bilateral lower extremity edema. The elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP) indicates potential heart failure or right-sided heart failure.

2. **Understanding Edema**: Lower extremity edema in this context is typically due to heart failure, where the heart is unable to pump effectively, leading to increased venous pressure and fluid accumulation in the interstitial spaces.

3. **Mechanism of Edema Formation**:
   - **Increased Capillary Pressure**: In heart failure, the heart's reduced ability to pump leads to blood backing up in the venous system, which increases hydrostatic pressure in the capillaries. This increased capillary pressure causes more fluid to leak into the surrounding tissues, resulting in edema.
   - **Decrease in Plasma Proteins**: This would typically lead to edema but is less likely in this scenario given the patient's heart failure context.
   - **Increase in Colloid Osmotic Pressure**: This would actually help retain fluid within the vascular space and reduce edema.
   - **Increase in Capillary Permeability**: This can cause edema but is not the primary mechanism in heart failure-related edema.
   - **Increase in Interstitial Fluid Pressure**: This is a consequence of edema formation, not a cause.

4. **Conclusion**: The most likely explanation for this patient's lower extremity edema is an increase in capillary pressure due to the heart's inability to effectively pump blood, leading to fluid accumulation in the interstitial spaces.

Therefore, the answer is: **(A) Increase in capillary pressure**.
Path 2: Let's analyze the scenario step by step. The patient has a history of myocardial infarction and presents with dyspnea on exertion, elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP), and bilateral lower extremity edema. 

1. **Understanding the Symptoms**: The elevated JVP suggests right-sided heart failure or congestive heart failure, which is consistent with the history of myocardial infarction. This condition leads to fluid retention and congestion in the venous system.

2. **Mechanism of Edema**: In heart failure, the heart is unable to pump effectively, leading to increased pressure in the venous system. This increased venous pressure translates to increased capillary pressure in the lower extremities, causing fluid to leak into the interstitial space, resulting in edema.

3. **Analyzing the Options**:
   - (A) Increase in capillary pressure: This is likely, as the heart failure causes increased pressure in the venous system and subsequently in the capillaries.
   - (B) Decrease in plasma proteins: This can cause edema but is not the primary issue here.
   - (C) Increase in capillary permeability: This is not typically a primary factor in heart failure-related edema.
   - (D) Increase in colloid osmotic pressure: This would tend to keep fluid in the vascular space and would not explain edema.
   - (E) Increase in interstitial fluid pressure: This is a consequence of increased capillary pressure but not the primary mechanism causing edema.

Given this analysis, the most likely explanation for the patient's lower extremity edema is (A) Increase in capillary pressure. 

**Answer: (A) Increase in capillary pressure**
Path 3: Let's analyze the clinical presentation step by step.

The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of myocardial infarction, now presenting with dyspnea on exertion, elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP), and bilateral lower extremity edema. These findings suggest that the patient may have heart failure, which can lead to fluid overload and congestion.

1. **Elevated JVP**: This indicates increased pressure in the right atrium, often due to heart failure, which can result from myocardial infarction.
2. **Pitting edema in lower extremities**: This is often a result of fluid retention, commonly seen in heart failure due to increased capillary pressures in the venous system.

In heart failure, the heart's decreased ability to pump effectively leads to an increase in capillary hydrostatic pressure due to fluid backing up in the venous system. This increased pressure pushes fluid out of the capillaries into the interstitial space, resulting in edema.

Given these considerations, the most likely explanation for this patient's lower extremity edema is:

**(A) Increase in capillary pressure**. 

This increased pressure is a direct consequence of heart failure and is responsible for the development of peripheral edema.
Path 4: Let's analyze the patient's presentation step by step.

1. **Patient History**: The patient has a history of myocardial infarction, suggesting potential heart failure.
  
2. **Symptoms**: The patient reports dyspnea on exertion and has swollen feet and ankles, which are classic signs of fluid retention often associated with heart failure.

3. **Physical Exam Findings**: The elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP) suggests elevated central venous pressure, indicative of right heart failure or volume overload. The presence of 2+ pitting edema in the bilateral lower extremities further supports the diagnosis of fluid overload.

4. **Mechanism of Edema Formation**: In heart failure, the heart is unable to pump effectively, leading to increased capillary hydrostatic pressure due to fluid backing up in the venous system. This increased pressure causes fluid to leak into the interstitial space, resulting in edema.

Given this information, the most likely explanation for this patient's lower extremity edema is:

**Answer: (A) Increase in capillary pressure**
Path 5: Let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of myocardial infarction, which suggests he might have underlying heart failure.
2. He presents with dyspnea on exertion and swollen feet and ankles, which are common symptoms of fluid overload due to heart failure.
3. The examination findings of elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP) and bilateral lower extremity edema indicate that there is likely fluid retention and congestion.

Now, let's consider the options provided for the explanation of his lower extremity edema:

- (A) Increase in capillary pressure: This is the most likely cause of edema in heart failure. In heart failure, the heart's ability to pump effectively is compromised, leading to increased venous pressure and consequently increased capillary hydrostatic pressure. This results in more fluid being pushed out of the capillaries into the interstitial space, causing edema.
  
- (B) Decrease in plasma proteins: This would lead to edema due to decreased oncotic pressure, but it is less likely in this scenario given that the patient has heart failure rather than a condition leading to low protein levels.

- (C) Increase in capillary permeability: This is typically associated with inflammatory processes rather than heart failure.

- (D) Increase in colloid osmotic pressure: This would actually reduce edema, as it would pull fluid back into the vascular space.

- (E) Increase in interstitial fluid pressure: This could occur as a result of edema but is not a primary cause; it is more of a consequence.

Given the context of heart failure and the clinical findings, the most likely explanation for this patient's lower extremity edema is an increase in capillary pressure due to heart failure.

Answer: (A) Increase in capillary pressure.
Path 6: Let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. **Patient Presentation**: The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of myocardial infarction who presents with dyspnea on exertion and swollen feet and ankles. These symptoms suggest the presence of heart failure or fluid overload.

2. **Physical Exam Findings**: The elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP) and 2+ pitting edema in the lower extremities indicate that there is likely an issue with fluid balance and circulation, often seen in congestive heart failure (CHF).

3. **Understanding Edema Formation**: Lower extremity edema can occur due to several mechanisms:
   - **Increase in capillary pressure**: This can happen in conditions like heart failure, where the heart's decreased ability to pump blood effectively leads to increased hydrostatic pressure in the venous system, causing fluid to leak into the interstitial space.
   - **Decrease in plasma proteins (hypoalbuminemia)**: This can lead to decreased oncotic pressure, resulting in edema, but this is less common in the context of heart failure unless there is significant liver disease or nephrotic syndrome.
   - **Increase in colloid osmotic pressure**: This would typically decrease edema, as it pulls fluid back into the vascular space.
   - **Increase in capillary permeability**: This can cause edema but is usually associated with inflammatory processes or injury.
   - **Increase in interstitial fluid pressure**: While this can contribute to edema, it does not directly explain the mechanism in this scenario.

4. **Conclusion**: Given that the patient exhibits symptoms consistent with heart failure and has an elevated JVP, the most likely explanation for the lower extremity edema is due to an **increase in capillary pressure** caused by the heart's inability to effectively pump blood, leading to fluid accumulation in the interstitial spaces.

Therefore, the answer is: **(A) Increase in capillary pressure**.
Path 7: Let's analyze the situation step by step. The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of myocardial infarction, who is presenting with dyspnea on exertion, elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP), and bilateral lower extremity edema. 

1. **History of Myocardial Infarction:** This suggests a possible history of heart failure, which can lead to fluid retention and edema due to decreased cardiac output.

2. **Elevated JVP:** This indicates increased pressure in the right atrium, which is commonly associated with right heart failure or congestive heart failure. 

3. **Bilateral Lower Extremity Edema:** This is typically due to increased hydrostatic pressure in the capillaries, which causes fluid to leak into the interstitial space.

Now, let's evaluate the options:
- (A) **Increase in capillary pressure:** This is the most likely explanation for the edema in this patient. In heart failure, the heart's reduced ability to pump effectively leads to increased pressure in the venous system, which causes fluid to leak into surrounding tissues.

- (B) **Decrease in plasma proteins:** While this can cause edema (such as in nephrotic syndrome), it is not the primary mechanism in this case.

- (C) **Increase in capillary permeability:** This could lead to edema, but it is often associated with inflammation or allergic reactions, which are not indicated here.

- (D) **Increase in colloid osmotic pressure:** This would counteract edema formation, not cause it.

- (E) **Increase in interstitial fluid pressure:** While this can happen as a result of edema, it is not the primary driving force; rather, it is a consequence of increased capillary pressure.

Given the context and the mechanisms involved, the most likely explanation for this patient's lower extremity edema is:

Answer: **(A) Increase in capillary pressure.**
Path 8: Let's analyze the information step by step.

The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of myocardial infarction, who presents with dyspnea on exertion and swollen feet and ankles. Upon examination, there are signs of elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP) and bilateral lower extremity edema.

1. **Elevated JVP**: This suggests increased pressure in the right atrium or systemic venous circulation, often due to heart failure or fluid overload.
   
2. **Bilateral lower extremity edema**: This indicates fluid accumulation in the interstitial spaces of the legs, commonly associated with conditions that lead to increased hydrostatic pressure in the capillaries.

Now, let's evaluate the options:

- (B) **Decrease in plasma proteins**: This could lead to edema due to decreased oncotic pressure, but it usually presents with generalized edema rather than isolated lower extremity edema.
  
- (E) **Increase in interstitial fluid pressure**: While this can cause edema, it is typically a consequence of other factors rather than the primary cause.

- (A) **Increase in capillary pressure**: This is the most likely explanation for the patient's edema. In heart failure, the heart's inability to pump effectively leads to fluid retention and increased venous pressure, causing increased hydrostatic pressure in the capillaries and resulting in edema.

- (D) **Increase in colloid osmotic pressure**: This would typically decrease edema, as it would pull fluid back into the capillaries.

- (C) **Increase in capillary permeability**: This could also cause edema, but it would often be associated with inflammation or injury and not primarily related to heart failure.

Given the patient's symptoms and examination findings, the most likely explanation for the lower extremity edema is:

**Answer: (A) Increase in capillary pressure.**
Path 9: Let's analyze the situation step-by-step:

1. **Patient Background**: The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of myocardial infarction, which suggests he may have underlying heart failure.

2. **Symptoms**: He presents with dyspnea on exertion and swollen feet and ankles. These symptoms are consistent with heart failure, where the heart cannot effectively pump blood, leading to fluid accumulation.

3. **Physical Exam Findings**: The elevated JVP (jugular venous pressure) and 2+ pitting edema in the bilateral lower extremities strongly suggest congestive heart failure, which can lead to fluid retention in the body.

4. **Mechanism for Edema**: In heart failure, the primary mechanism for the development of lower extremity edema is an increase in capillary hydrostatic pressure due to increased venous pressure from the heart's inability to pump effectively. This causes fluid to leak out of the capillaries and into the interstitial space, leading to edema.

Now, looking at the answer options:

- (A) Increase in capillary pressure: This is likely the correct explanation, as it aligns with the pathophysiology of heart failure leading to edema.
- (B) Decrease in plasma proteins: This would lead to edema, but it is not the primary mechanism in this case.
- (C) Increase in capillary permeability: This can cause edema but is not the primary reason here.
- (D) Increase in colloid osmotic pressure: This would typically decrease edema, not cause it.
- (E) Increase in interstitial fluid pressure: While this could contribute to a further accumulation of fluid, it is not the primary cause in this scenario.

Therefore, the most likely explanation for this patient's lower extremity edema is:

**Answer: (A) Increase in capillary pressure.**
Path 10: Let's analyze the situation step by step. 

The patient has a history of myocardial infarction and presents with symptoms suggestive of heart failure, including dyspnea on exertion, elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP), and pitting edema in the lower extremities. In heart failure, the heart's ability to pump blood effectively is compromised, which can lead to several physiological changes.

1. **Elevated JVP**: This indicates that there is increased pressure in the venous system, which is consistent with heart failure. 

2. **Lower extremity edema**: This occurs when there is an imbalance in the forces that regulate fluid movement between the capillaries and the interstitial space. 

In cases of heart failure, one of the primary mechanisms that lead to peripheral edema is an **increase in capillary pressure**. This is due to the increased venous pressure from poor cardiac output, resulting in fluid being pushed out of the capillaries into the interstitial space, leading to edema.

Other options can be considered:
- **Decrease in plasma proteins** (B) would lead to decreased osmotic pressure and could cause edema, but this patient does not present with signs of liver disease or nephrotic syndrome that would suggest low plasma protein levels.
- **Increase in interstitial fluid pressure** (E) typically occurs as a result of edema rather than being the cause.
- **Increase in colloid osmotic pressure** (D) would generally help retain fluid in the vascular space, reducing edema.
- **Increase in capillary permeability** (C) can cause edema in inflammatory conditions but is not the primary mechanism in heart failure.

Considering all these points, the most likely explanation for this patient's lower extremity edema is:

**Answer: (A) Increase in capillary pressure.**

Question: A 43-year-old man presents with the complaint of pain in the small joints of his left hand. The pain is intermittent and cramping in nature in his 2nd and 3rd metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints. It has progressively worsened over the past few weeks. He also reports that he has felt thirsty more often and has urinated more frequently over the past few weeks. He denies any pain during micturition. His stools are pale in color. He also reports that his skin appears to be darker than usual even though he has not been outdoors much over the past few weeks. Physical exam is significant for tenderness in the 2nd and 3rd MCPs of both hands as well as tenderness in the right upper quadrant of his abdomen. Lab results show:
Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 450 U/L
Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 350 U/L
Serum ferritin 460 ng/mL
Deficiency of which of the following is the most likely cause of his symptoms? (C) Hepcidin (B) Pyridoxine (D) Ceruloplasmin (A) Transferrin (E) α1-antitrypsin
Reason: The symptoms and lab findings presented in this case suggest a condition related to iron metabolism, specifically hemochromatosis. The elevated serum ferritin indicates iron overload, and hepcidin plays a critical role in regulating iron homeostasis. A deficiency in hepcidin can lead to increased iron absorption and deposition in various organs, explaining the patient's joint pain, skin changes, and elevated liver enzymes.
Answer: (C) Hepcidin

Question: An 8-year-old boy and his 26-year-old babysitter are brought into the emergency department with severe injuries caused by a motor vehicle accident. The child is wheeled to the pediatric intensive care unit with a severe injury to his right arm, as well as other external and internal injuries. He is hemorrhaging and found to be hemodynamically unstable. He subsequently requires transfusion and surgery, and he is currently unconscious. The pediatric trauma surgeon evaluates the child’s arm and realizes it will need to be amputated at the elbow. Which of the following is the most appropriate course of action to take with regards to the amputation? (C) Wait for the child’s babysitter to recover from her injuries to obtain her consent to amputate the child’s arm (A) Amputate the child’s arm at the elbow joint (D) Find the child’s parents to obtain consent to amputate the child’s arm (E) Obtain an emergency court order from a judge to obtain consent to amputate the child’s arm (B) Wait for the child to gain consciousness to obtain his consent to amputate his arm
Reason: In emergency medical situations where a patient is hemodynamically unstable and requires immediate intervention to save their life or limb, it is often justified to proceed with necessary procedures such as amputation without waiting for parental consent. This is because the urgency of the situation necessitates prompt action to prevent further complications, and the principle of implied consent allows medical professionals to act in the best interest of the patient when they are unable to provide consent themselves.
Answer: (A) Amputate the child’s arm at the elbow joint

Question: A 56-year-old man comes to the clinic complaining of intermittent abdominal pain for the past 2 months. He reports that the pain improves with oral intake and is concentrated at the epigastric area. The pain is described as gnawing in quality and improves when he takes his wife’s ranitidine. He denies weight changes, fever, chest pain, or recent travel but endorses “brain fog” and decreased libido. An upper endoscopy reveals ulcerations at the duodenum and jejunum. Physical examination demonstrates bilateral hemianopsia, gynecomastia, and diffuse pain upon palpation at the epigastric area. Laboratory findings are demonstrated below:

Serum:
Na+: 137 mEq/dL
Cl-: 96 mEq/L
K+: 3.9 mEq/dL
HCO3-: 25 mEq/L
Glucose: 110 mg/dL
Creatinine: .7 mg/dL
Ca2+: 13.5 mg/dL

What is the best explanation for this patient’s findings? (D) Mutation of the MEN1 gene (C) Mutation of the APC gene (E) Mutation of the RET gene (A) Gastrin secreting tumor of the pancreas (B) Infection with Helicobacter pylori
Reason: The combination of symptoms and laboratory findings in this patient suggests the presence of a neuroendocrine tumor associated with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 1 (MEN1), which includes conditions like Zollinger-Ellison syndrome due to gastrin-secreting tumors, hyperparathyroidism (indicated by elevated calcium levels), and pituitary tumors (likely explaining the gynecomastia and brain fog). The multidisciplinary aspects of the patient's symptoms—abdominal pain, ulcerations, high calcium, and gynecomastia—point towards an underlying genetic mutation in MEN1, making this the most plausible explanation for his clinical presentation.
Answer: (D) Mutation of the MEN1 gene

Question: A 51-year-old woman with a history of palpitations is being evaluated by a surgeon for epigastric pain. It is discovered that she has an epigastric hernia that needs repair. During her preoperative evaluation, she is ordered to receive lab testing, an electrocardiogram (ECG), and a chest X-ray. These screening studies are unremarkable except for her chest X-ray, which shows a 2 cm isolated pulmonary nodule in the middle lobe of the right lung. The nodule has poorly defined margins, and it shows a dense, irregular pattern of calcification. The patient is immediately referred to a pulmonologist for evaluation of the lesion. The patient denies any recent illnesses and states that she has not traveled outside of the country since she was a child. She has had no sick contacts or respiratory symptoms, and she does not currently take any medications. She does, however, admit to a 20-pack-year history of smoking. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluating this patient’s diagnosis with regard to the pulmonary nodule? (E) Try to obtain previous chest radiographs for comparison (B) Send sputum for cytology (A) Obtain a contrast-enhanced CT scan of the chest (C) Order a positron emission tomography scan of the chest (D) Perform a flexible bronchoscopy with biopsy
Reason: The correct next step in evaluating this patient’s pulmonary nodule is to try to obtain previous chest radiographs for comparison (option E). Previous imaging can provide valuable context regarding the nodule's stability or changes over time, which is crucial for determining the likelihood of malignancy. Establishing a trend in the nodule's appearance can significantly impact the management plan, helping to differentiate between benign and potentially malignant processes.
Answer: (E) Try to obtain previous chest radiographs for comparison

Question: A 45-year-old man is brought into the emergency department after he was hit by a car. The patient was intoxicated and walked into oncoming traffic. He is currently unconscious and has a Glasgow coma scale score of 3. The patient has been admitted multiple times for alcohol intoxication and pancreatitis. The patient is resuscitated with fluid and blood products. An initial trauma survey reveals minor scrapes and abrasions and pelvic instability. The patient’s pelvis is placed in a binder. After further resuscitation the patient becomes responsive and states he is in pain. He is given medications and further resuscitation ensues. One hour later, the patient complains of numbness surrounding his mouth and in his extremities. Which of the following is the most likely explanation of this patient’s current symptoms? (B) Late-onset edema surrounding the spinal cord (C) Medication complication (A) Hypokalemia (D) Transfusion complication (E) Trauma to the spinal cord
Reason: The most likely explanation for this patient's symptoms of numbness around the mouth and in his extremities is a transfusion complication (option D). This is because the patient has received blood products during resuscitation, and neurological symptoms can indicate a transfusion reaction, particularly if the patient develops a transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) or an allergic reaction, which may present with neurological symptoms as part of a broader systemic response. Additionally, the timing of the symptoms occurring shortly after transfusion supports this explanation.
Answer: (D) Transfusion complication

Question: A 47-year-old woman presents with complaints of fever, chills, and rigor. On physical exam, she also has left sided costovertebral tenderness. Vitals include a temperature of 39.4°C (103.0°F), blood pressure of 125/84 mm Hg, and pulse of 84/min. She has type 2 diabetes and is currently taking metformin daily. Urine dipstick analysis is positive for leukocytes, nitrites, and blood. The most likely cause for the present condition is? (D) Acute interstitial nephritis (E) Acute papillary necrosis (A) Acute cystitis (C) Acute tubular necrosis (B) Acute glomerulonephritis
Reason: The most likely cause for this patient's condition is acute papillary necrosis (option E). The presence of fever, chills, and left-sided costovertebral tenderness, along with positive urine dipstick findings for leukocytes, nitrites, and blood, suggests a urinary tract infection that has potentially ascended to involve the kidneys, leading to tissue ischemia and necrosis. Given her comorbid diabetes, which can predispose to urinary tract complications and renal issues, acute papillary necrosis becomes a probable diagnosis, particularly if there are risk factors such as obstruction or infection.
Answer: (E) Acute papillary necrosis

Question: A neurophysiology expert is teaching his students the physiology of the neuromuscular junction. While describing the sequence of events that takes place at the neuromuscular junction, he mentions that as the action potential travels down the motor neuron, it causes depolarization of the presynaptic membrane. This results in the opening of voltage-gated calcium channels, which leads to an influx of calcium into the synapse of the motor neuron. Consequently, the cytosolic concentration of Ca2+ ions increases. Which of the following occurs at the neuromuscular junction as a result of this increase in cytosolic Ca2+? (E) Generation of an end plate potential (C) Increased Na+ and K+ conductance of the motor end plate (D) Exocytosis of acetylcholine from the synaptic vesicles (A) Release of Ca2+ ions into the synaptic cleft (B) Binding of Ca2+ ions to NM receptors
Reason: The answer is (D) Exocytosis of acetylcholine from the synaptic vesicles because the increase in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration triggers the fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic membrane. This process results in the release of acetylcholine into the synaptic cleft, which is essential for the transmission of the nerve signal to the muscle fiber at the neuromuscular junction.
Answer: (D) Exocytosis of acetylcholine from the synaptic vesicles

Question: A 44-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 1-month history of progressively worsening headaches and fatigue. She has also had a 5-kg (11-lb) weight loss in the same time period. MRI of the head shows a hyperintense mass with extension into the right foramen rotundum. Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following findings? (A) Decreased sensation over the cheekbone, nasolabial fold, and the upper lip (B) Hemiatrophy of the tongue with right-sided deviation when protruded (E) Masseter and temporalis muscle wasting with jaw deviation to the right (C) Abnormal taste of the distal tongue and decreased sensation behind the ear (D) Absent corneal reflex and decreased sensation of the forehead
Reason: The answer is (A) Decreased sensation over the cheekbone, nasolabial fold, and the upper lip because the described MRI finding of a hyperintense mass extending into the right foramen rotundum suggests potential involvement of the trigeminal nerve (CN V). Specifically, the maxillary branch (V2) of the trigeminal nerve innervates sensation to that facial region, and compression or damage to this nerve would lead to decreased sensation in these areas.
Answer: (A) Decreased sensation over the cheekbone, nasolabial fold, and the upper lip

He can speak in 4 word sentences, tells stories, and parents understand 100% of what he says. He names colors and is starting to recognize letters. However, his pre-kindergarten teachers are concerned that even after 5 months in their class, he does not speak during school at all. The father notes that he is equally as shy in church, which he has been going to his entire life. Which of the following is most likely? (B) Child abuse at school (E) Selective mutism (C) Expressive speech delay (D) Normal development (A) Autism spectrum disorder
Reason: Selective mutism is characterized by a consistent inability to speak in specific social situations despite speaking in other settings, such as at home. The boy's behavior of speaking freely with family and friends but remaining silent in school and church contexts, along with his normal speech development at home, aligns well with this diagnosis, indicating a fear or anxiety about speaking in certain environments rather than a broader communication disorder.

Question: A 56-year-old man is brought to the emergency department for the evaluation of a 3-day history of left lower abdominal pain. During this period, the patient has also had a low-grade fever and has not had a bowel movement. He has a history of constipation. He underwent a cholecystectomy at the age of 53 years. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for the last 30 years. His temperature is 38.8°C (101.8°F), pulse is 80/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/84 mm Hg. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. Abdominal examination shows left lower quadrant tenderness with no guarding or rebound. There is no edema of his lower extremities. CT of the abdomen with contrast shows segmental wall thickening of the descending colon with multiple diverticula, surrounding fat stranding, and a 5.5-cm, low-attenuating pelvic fluid collection. Intravenous fluids and bowel rest are started. Treatment with intravenous morphine, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole is begun. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient? (A) Observation and serial CT scans (E) Segmental colonic resection
" (B) Left laparoscopic hemicolectomy (C) Colonoscopy (D) CT-guided percutaneous abscess drainage
Reason: The patient's presentation is consistent with diverticulitis complicated by an abscess, which is indicated by the CT findings of segmental wall thickening, diverticula, fat stranding, and a low-attenuating fluid collection. In cases where an abscess is present, CT-guided percutaneous drainage is often the first and most appropriate step before considering surgical interventions, especially in the absence of severe complications or peritonitis. This allows for effective management of the abscess while potentially avoiding more invasive surgical procedures.

Question: A 25-year-old college student is diagnosed with acute myelogenous leukemia after presenting with a 3-week history of fever, malaise, and fatigue. He has a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus, multiple middle ear infections as a child, and infectious mononucleosis in high school. He currently smokes 1 pack of cigarettes per day, drinks a glass of wine per day, and denies any illicit drug use. The vital signs include: temperature 36.7°C (98.0°F), blood pressure 126/74 mm Hg, heart rate 87/min, and respiratory rate 17/min. On physical examination, his pulses are bounding; his complexion is pale, but breath sounds remain clear. A rapidly progressive form of leukemia is identified, and the patient is scheduled to start intravenous chemotherapy. Which of the following treatments should be given to this patient to prevent or decrease the likelihood of developing acute renal failure during treatment? (E) Indomethacin (A) Sulfinpyrazone (B) Probenecid (C) Allopurinol (D) Colchicine
Reason: In patients undergoing treatment for acute myelogenous leukemia, the rapid cell lysis that can occur with chemotherapy can lead to the release of uric acid into the bloodstream, resulting in hyperuricemia and potentially acute renal failure. Allopurinol is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor that decreases uric acid production, thereby helping to prevent nephropathy associated with tumor lysis syndrome during chemotherapy. This makes it the most appropriate prophylactic treatment choice for this patient.
Answer: (C) Allopurinol

Pelvic exam reveals normal female external genitalia, a closed and slightly soft cervix, a ten-week-sized uterus, and no adnexal masses. Which of the following is the best next step for definitively determining whether this patient’s fetus has Down syndrome? (C) Anatomy ultrasound (D) Genetic testing of patient’s sister (B) Chorionic villus sampling (A) Amniocentesis (E) Nuchal translucency test
Reason: The best next step for definitively determining whether this patient's fetus has Down syndrome is chorionic villus sampling (CVS) because it allows for the early genetic analysis of the fetus at about 10-13 weeks of gestation, providing a more timely diagnosis compared to other methods like amniocentesis, which is performed later in pregnancy. While nuchal translucency testing can indicate an increased risk for Down syndrome, it is not definitive and relies on additional screenings rather than direct genetic testing which CVS provides.
Answer: (B) Chorionic villus sampling

Question: A 28-year-old primigravid woman at 36 weeks' gestation comes to the emergency department because of worsening pelvic pain for 2 hours. Three days ago, she had a burning sensation with urination that resolved spontaneously. She has nausea and has vomited fluid twice on her way to the hospital. She appears ill. Her temperature is 39.7°C (103.5°F), pulse is 125/min, respirations are 33/min, and blood pressure is 130/70 mm Hg. Abdominal examination shows diffuse tenderness. No contractions are felt. Speculum examination shows pooling of nonbloody, malodorous fluid in the vaginal vault. The cervix is not effaced or dilated. Laboratory studies show a hemoglobin concentration of 14 g/dL, a leukocyte count of 16,000/mm3, and a platelet count of 250,000/mm3. Fetal heart rate is 148/min and reactive with no decelerations. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? (D) Administer intravenous ampicillin and gentamicin and induce labor (C) Administer oral azithromycin and induce labor (B) Expectant management (A) Administer intravenous ampicillin and gentamicin and perform C-section (E) Perform C-section
Reason: The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous ampicillin and gentamicin and induce labor because the patient exhibits signs of infection with a fever and leukocytosis, which suggest possible chorioamnionitis. Given her advanced gestation and the presence of malodorous fluid, initiating broad-spectrum antibiotics along with the imminent induction of labor is necessary to protect both the mother and fetus from potential complications related to the infection.
Answer: (D) Administer intravenous ampicillin and gentamicin and induce labor

Question: A 42-year-old man comes to the physician because of fatigue and decreased urination for the past 3 days. His creatinine is 2.5 mg/dL. A photomicrograph of a biopsy specimen of the right kidney is shown. Which of the following mechanisms most likely contributed to this patient's biopsy findings? (B) Segmental collapse of glomerular capillaries (E) Deposition of immunoglobulin light chains (A) Fibrin formation in Bowman space (C) Effacement of podocyte foot processes (D) Expansion of the mesangial matrix
Reason: The mechanism that most likely contributed to this patient's biopsy findings is fibrin formation in Bowman space because this is often indicative of a severe glomerular injury that can lead to conditions such as rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN). The presence of fibrin in this context suggests significant damage to the glomerular capillaries and disruptions in normal filtration processes, which may correlate with the patient's elevated creatinine levels and symptoms of fatigue and decreased urination.
Answer: (A) Fibrin formation in Bowman space

Question: A 13-year-old male is admitted to the hospital for treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. During his hospital course, he develops a fever of 39.0 degrees Celsius. A CBC demonstrates a leukocyte count of <500 /mm^3. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial management of this patient? (A) Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) (C) Oral doxycycline (D) Oral ciprofloxacin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (E) Strict quarantine and hand-washing (B) IV ceftazidime
Reason: The choice of IV ceftazidime as the most appropriate initial management is supported by the fact that the patient has a fever and a severely low leukocyte count, indicating a high risk for neutropenic infection. Prompt initiation of broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics is essential in such cases to effectively treat potential life-threatening infections.
Answer: (B) IV ceftazidime

Question: A 62-year-old woman has been receiving amoxicillin for acute sinusitis for 12 days. She develops a macular rash on her neck, back, and torso. The amoxicillin is therefore changed to cephalexin for an additional week. The rash resolves, but she returns complaining of fatigue, flank pain, and fever that has persisted despite the resolution of the sinusitis. She has a history of essential hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and gastric reflux. She has been on a stable regimen of lisinopril, simvastatin, and omeprazole. Today, her vital signs reveal: temperature 37.9°C (100.2°F), blood pressure 145/90 mm Hg, regular pulse 75/min, and respirations 16/min. The physical examination is unremarkable. Serum urea and creatinine are elevated. Urinalysis shows leukocyturia, but urine bacterial culture is negative. A urine cytospin stained with Hansel’s solution reveals 3% binucleated cells with eosinophilic, granular cytoplasm. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? (A) Acute interstitial nephritis (D) Acute vascular injury (C) Acute tubular necrosis (B) Acute glomerulonephritis (E) IgA nephropathy
Reason: Acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) is suggested by the patient's recent antibiotic exposure (amoxicillin and cephalexin), the presence of eosinophils in the urine, and the elevated serum urea and creatinine levels, which indicate kidney impairment. AIN is commonly associated with drug reactions, often characterized by an allergic response leading to inflammation of the renal interstitium, typically indicated by symptoms of fever, rash, and urinary changes as observed in this patient.
Answer: (A) Acute interstitial nephritis

Question: A 16-year-old girl is brought to the physician for recurrent episodes of shortness of breath, nonproductive cough, and chest tightness for 3 months. These episodes occur especially while playing sports and resolve spontaneously with rest. She appears healthy. Her pulse is 63/min, respirations are 15/min, and blood pressure is 102/70 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 98%. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. An x-ray of the chest shows no abnormalities. Spirometry shows a FEV1:FVC ratio of 85% and a FEV1of 85% of predicted. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? (A) CT scan of the chest (E) Echocardiography (D) Genetic testing (C) Prednisone therapy (B) Albuterol before exercise
Reason: The most appropriate next step in management is albuterol before exercise, as the patient's symptoms are consistent with exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) or asthma. Since her episodes of shortness of breath occur during physical activity and resolve with rest, using a bronchodilator like albuterol prior to exercise can help prevent these respiratory symptoms by relaxing the airway muscles and improving airflow.
Answer: (B) Albuterol before exercise

Question: An 80-year-old man is admitted to the hospital after the sudden onset of sub-sternal chest pain and shortness of breath while sitting in a chair. He has hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for 42 years. Four days after admission, he becomes tachycardic and then loses consciousness; the cardiac monitor shows irregular electrical activity. Cardiac examination shows a new systolic murmur at the apex. Despite appropriate measures, he dies. Microscopic evaluation of the myocardium is most likely to show which of the following? (D) Dense granulation tissue with collagenous scar formation (A) Coagulative necrosis with dense neutrophilic infiltrate (C) Low cellularity with dense, non-contractile scar tissue (B) Wavy myocardial fibers without inflammatory cells (E) Hyperemic granulation tissue with abundance of macrophages
Reason: In the context of this patient's sudden onset of chest pain, diabetes, smoking history, and subsequent deterioration, the sequence of events is indicative of an acute myocardial infarction followed by a healing phase. After several days, the presence of hyperemic granulation tissue with abundant macrophages suggests that the myocardium is in the process of organizing and healing, which is consistent with the timeframe post-infarction during which inflammation and repair occur.
Answer: (E) Hyperemic granulation tissue with abundance of macrophages

Question: A 37-year-old male presents to your clinic with shortness of breath and lower extremity edema. He was born in Southeast Asia and emigrated to America ten years prior. Examination demonstrates 2+ pitting edema to the level of his knees, ascites, and bibasilar crackles, as well as an opening snap followed by a mid-to-late diastolic murmur. The patient undergoes a right heart catheterization that demonstrates a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) of 24 mmHg. The patient is most likely to have which of the following? (A) Increased pulmonary vascular compliance (B) Decreased pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) (E) Decreased transmitral gradient (D) Normal or decreased left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP) (C) Increased left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP)
Reason: The correct answer to the question regarding the patient’s condition based on the provided symptoms and test results is (C) Increased left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP). The reasoning for this is that the patient's presentation suggests heart failure with elevated pressures, as indicated by the high pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) of 24 mmHg. This typically correlates with increased left ventricular end diastolic pressure, as it reflects increased pressure in the left atrium and pulmonary circulation, which contributes to symptoms such as shortness of breath and lower extremity edema.
Answer: (D) Normal or decreased left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP)

[INFO] Opinion paths:
Path 1: Let's think through the information provided step by step.

The patient is a 32-year-old woman with a history of amenorrhea for 4 months, a grape-like mass protruding from her vagina, and elevated blood pressure. The ultrasound examination indicates that no fetal parts are seen, which is suggestive of a molar pregnancy.

In cases of complete hydatidiform mole (which is consistent with the presentation of a "grape-like mass"), the most common genotype is 46XX, where the genetic material is derived entirely from paternal origin (with the sperm contributing both sets of chromosomes, resulting in an abnormal number of chromosomes).

For a partial hydatidiform mole, the genotype might be 69XXX or 69XXY, which occurs when there is fertilization of an egg by two sperm, leading to triploidy. However, given the presentation and the details provided, a complete mole (46XX) is the most likely diagnosis.

Therefore, the genotype of the substance that will be aspirated by dilation and evacuation is: 

Answer: (E) 46XX
Path 2: Let's analyze the information provided in the question step by step. 

The patient is a 32-year-old woman presenting with a history suggestive of a possible molar pregnancy (the grape-like mass protruding from the vagina and the absence of fetal heart sounds). Given that the last menstrual period was 4 months ago, and considering the symptoms, this could indicate a hydatidiform mole, which is a type of gestational trophoblastic disease.

In a complete hydatidiform mole, the genotype is typically 46XX (which is a combination of maternal chromosomes without any contribution from paternal chromosomes) or 46XY (with all paternal chromosomes). However, since the question focuses on the substance that will be aspirated (which is likely to be the abnormal trophoblastic tissue), the most common presentation for a complete mole is 46XX.

On the other hand, a partial mole would have a triploid genotype (69XXX, 69XXY, or 69XYY) but does not seem to fit the classic presentation of this case, since we have a more solid indication of a complete mole.

Given these considerations, the most likely genotype of the substance to be aspirated by dilation and evacuation in this case is:

**Answer: (E) 46XX**
Path 3: Given the clinical presentation of the patient, including the grape-like mass protruding from the vagina, amenorrhea, and hypertension, the findings are suggestive of a molar pregnancy, specifically a complete hydatidiform mole.

In a complete hydatidiform mole, there is typically an abnormal proliferation of trophoblastic tissue. The genotype associated with a complete mole is usually 46XX (from the fertilization of an empty ovum by two sperm or duplication of a single sperm's chromosomes) or 46XY. However, the common presentation for a complete mole is usually denoted as 46XX.

So based on the information provided and the common genetic makeup of a complete hydatidiform mole, the answer would be:

Answer: (E) 46XX
Path 4: Let's analyze the clinical scenario step by step:

1. The patient is a 32-year-old woman with a history of amenorrhea (last menstrual period 4 months ago) and presenting symptoms including headaches and a grape-like mass protruding from her vagina. 

2. The fundus of the uterus is at the level of the umbilicus, indicating significant uterine enlargement, and there are no fetal heart sounds, suggesting a possible abnormal pregnancy.

3. The presence of a grape-like mass is characteristic of a gestational trophoblastic disease (such as a complete hydatidiform mole). 

4. The elevated blood pressure and pulse rate may indicate complications related to the condition, possibly due to the trophoblastic tissue producing hormones such as hCG.

In a complete hydatidiform mole, the typical genotype is 46,XX or 46,XY, but the most common finding in cases of complete moles is 69,XXY (triploidy), which is often associated with the presence of abnormal trophoblastic tissue.

Given the options provided:
- (A) 69XXY is a triploid genotype consistent with a complete mole.
- (E) 46XX is more consistent with a normal pregnancy.
- (B) 45XO is associated with Turner syndrome, which is not relevant here.
- (D) 47XYY is associated with Klinefelter syndrome.
- (C) 23XX is not a complete genotype.

Therefore, the correct answer is **(A) 69XXY**, which corresponds to the genotype of the tissue that would be aspirated in the case of a complete hydatidiform mole.
Path 5: Let's analyze the clinical presentation step by step. 

The patient is a 32-year-old woman who has missed her menstruation for 4 months and presents with a grape-like mass protruding from her vagina, elevated blood pressure, and a fundal height consistent with a significant uterine mass. The absence of fetal heart sounds and the findings on ultrasound suggest a diagnosis of a molar pregnancy, specifically a complete hydatidiform mole.

In a complete hydatidiform mole, the typical genotype is 46XX (from the mother's contribution of an egg with no genetic material and the fertilization by two sperm, which is why it is often associated with a diploid set of paternal chromosomes). In some cases, it can also be 46XY. However, since the question is about the substance aspirated through dilation and evacuation, we focus on the classic presentation.

Given the context and the typical findings, the most likely genotype of the substance aspirated by dilation and evacuation in this scenario would be 46XX.

Answer: (E) 46XX
Path 6: Let's analyze the clinical scenario step by step.

This 32-year-old woman is presenting with a history of amenorrhea, a grape-like mass protruding from her vagina, and significantly elevated blood pressure. The findings suggest a molar pregnancy, specifically a complete hydatidiform mole. In a complete molar pregnancy, the genetic material is typically derived from the sperm, and there is no contribution from maternal chromosomes (since there is no maternal genetic material in a complete mole).

In terms of the genotype:
- A complete hydatidiform mole usually has a triploid karyotype, most commonly 46XX, which is derived from the fertilization of an empty ovum by two sperm (resulting in 69 chromosomes), but the most common presentation in clinical scenarios is noted as 46XX.

Given the context and the options provided, the most appropriate answer for the genotype of the substance that would be aspirated by dilation and evacuation (D&E) in the case of a complete molar pregnancy is:

Answer: (E) 46XX
Path 7: Let's analyze the information provided step by step. 

This patient presents with several key clinical features: 
1. Absent menstrual period for 4 months (suggesting amenorrhea).
2. A grape-like mass protruding from the vagina (indicating possible gestational trophoblastic disease, such as a molar pregnancy).
3. Fundal height at the level of the umbilicus without fetal heart sounds (suggesting abnormal growth).
4. Hypertension and tachycardia.

Given the context, the presence of a grape-like mass and the other symptoms strongly suggest a complete or partial hydatidiform mole, which is a type of gestational trophoblastic disease. 

In a complete hydatidiform mole, the most common genotype is triploid, which is typically 69XXY (indicating two sets of maternal chromosomes and one set of paternal chromosomes). 

Therefore, the correct answer, reflecting the genotype of the substance that will be aspirated by dilation and evacuation in this case, is:

**Answer: (A) 69XXY**
Path 8: Let's analyze the clinical scenario step by step. 

The patient is a 32-year-old woman presenting with:

1. **Amenorrhea for 4 months** - This suggests that she is likely pregnant or experiencing some form of reproductive issue.
2. **Headache** - Could be related to elevated blood pressure or other factors.
3. **Grape-like mass protruding from the vagina** - This is highly indicative of a molar pregnancy (gestational trophoblastic disease), where there is abnormal growth of trophoblastic tissue.
4. **Fundal height at the level of the umbilicus** - This suggests an enlarged uterus, which may occur in conditions like molar pregnancy.
5. **No fetal heart sounds and no fetal parts on ultrasound** - Further supports the diagnosis of a molar pregnancy, as there is abnormal placental tissue without a viable fetus.

In the case of a complete molar pregnancy, the genotype is typically **69XXY**, indicating a triploid condition resulting from the fertilization of an egg by two sperm or from an egg with two sets of chromosomes. 

Given these considerations, the most appropriate answer regarding the genotype of the substance that will be aspirated by dilation and evacuation (D&E) in a complete molar pregnancy is:

**Answer: (A) 69XXY**.
Path 9: Let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. **Clinical Presentation**: The woman is 32 years old and has not had a menstrual period for 4 months. She presents with a grape-like mass protruding from her vagina, which strongly suggests the presence of a gestational trophoblastic disease, such as a molar pregnancy.

2. **Ultrasound Findings**: The ultrasound examination shows no fetal parts, and the fundus of the uterus is at the level of the umbilicus, which is not consistent with a normal pregnancy. The grape-like mass is characteristic of a hydatidiform mole.

3. **Blood Pressure and Heart Rate**: The patient has elevated blood pressure (160/100 mm Hg) and tachycardia (pulse rate of 108/min), which can be associated with gestational trophoblastic disease due to elevated levels of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG).

4. **Genotype of Molar Pregnancy**: Molar pregnancies can have different genetic compositions. A complete hydatidiform mole typically has a genotype of 46XX or 46XY, resulting from the fertilization of an empty ovum by a sperm that duplicates its chromosomes. In contrast, a partial mole typically has a triploid karyotype, such as 69XXX or 69XXY.

Given the context of the question, we are considering the most likely genotype associated with the grape-like mass from a complete molar pregnancy.

**Conclusion**: The most likely genotype of the substance that will be aspirated by dilation and evacuation in this case is 46XX (indicating a complete mole). 

Therefore, the answer is: (E) 46XX.
Path 10: Let's analyze the question step by step.

The clinical presentation describes a 32-year-old woman with signs and symptoms suggestive of a gestational trophoblastic disease, specifically a complete hydatidiform mole. The important points to note include:

- The absence of fetal heart sounds.
- The grape-like mass protruding from the vagina.
- The elevated blood pressure and tachycardia, which could indicate complications such as preeclampsia.
- The uterus being enlarged without evidence of a viable fetus.

In a complete hydatidiform mole, the genetic makeup is typically abnormal. Specifically, a complete mole is usually characterized by the presence of 46 chromosomes, which can arise from the fertilization of an empty ovum by a sperm that duplicates its genetic material, leading to a diploid set of paternal chromosomes.

The genotype associated with a complete hydatidiform mole is often 46XX, as the most common scenario involves fertilization of an empty egg by a sperm, resulting in a mole that has two sets of paternal chromosomes.

Considering all of this, the correct answer is:

**Answer: (E) 46XX**

Question:  A 43-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital for anticoagulation following a pulmonary embolism. She was found to have a deep venous thrombosis on further workup after a long plane ride coming back from visiting China. She denies any personal history of blood clots in her past, but she says that her mother has also had to be treated for pulmonary embolism in the recent past. Her past medical history is significant for preeclampsia, hypertension, polycystic ovarian syndrome, and hypercholesterolemia. She currently smokes 1 pack of cigarettes per day, drinks a glass of wine per day, and she currently denies any illicit drug use. The vital signs include: temperature 36.7°C (98.0°F), blood pressure 126/74 mm Hg, heart rate 111/min, and respiratory rate 23/min. On physical examination, her pulses are bounding and complexion is pale, but breath sounds remain clear. Oxygen saturation was initially 81% on room air, with a new oxygen requirement of 8 L by face mask. On day 6 of combined heparin and warfarin anticoagulation, her platelet count decreases from 182,000/mcL to 63,000/mcL. Her international normalized ratio (INR) is not yet therapeutic. What is the next best step in therapy? (A) Continue heparin and warfarin until INR is therapeutic for 24 hours (B) Discontinue heparin; continue warfarin (C) Continue heparin; discontinue warfarin (D) Discontinue heparin and warfarin (E) Continue heparin and warfarin, and administer vitamin K
Reason: The answer is (D) Discontinue heparin and warfarin because the patient is experiencing a significant drop in platelet count, indicative of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), which is a serious and potentially life-threatening condition. In this context, it is critical to stop both anticoagulants to prevent further complications and to consider alternative anticoagulation options.

Question: A 34-year-old man comes to the physician because of palpitations, shortness of breath, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps for 2 months. Physical examination shows cutaneous flushing of the face. Auscultation of the chest shows bilateral wheezing. A 24-hour urine collection shows increased 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) concentration. A contrast-enhanced CT scan of the abdomen shows an intestinal tumor with extensive metastasis to the liver. A diagnosis of an inoperable disease is made and the patient is started on treatment with octreotide. Six weeks later, the patient's symptoms have improved except for his abdominal pain and frequent loose stools. The physician suggests enrolling the patient in a trial to test additional treatment with a new drug that has been shown to improve symptoms in other patients with the same condition. The expected beneficial effect of this new drug is most likely caused by inhibition of which of the following? (B) Vasoactive intestinal peptide (E) Tryptophan hydroxylase (C) Plasma kallikrein (D) Histidine decarboxylase (A) Dopamine β-hydroxylase
Reason: The answer is (E) Tryptophan hydroxylase because the patient’s symptoms are consistent with a carcinoid tumor, which secretes serotonin and can lead to the overproduction of serotonin metabolites like 5-HIAA. By inhibiting tryptophan hydroxylase, which is the rate-limiting enzyme in serotonin synthesis, the drug could help reduce the levels of serotonin and alleviate the associated gastrointestinal symptoms and flushing.
Answer: (E) Tryptophan hydroxylase

Question: A previously healthy 42-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 1 hour after he was involved in a motor vehicle collision. He is conscious. He smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 16 years but quit 8 years ago. Physical examination shows several ecchymoses over the trunk and abdomen. The abdomen is soft, and there is tenderness to palpation of the right upper quadrant without guarding or rebound. Vital signs are within normal limits. An x-ray of the chest shows no fractures; a 10-mm solid pulmonary nodule is present in the central portion of the right upper lung field. No previous x-rays of the patient are available. A CT scan of the chest is performed, which shows that the nodule has irregular, scalloped borders. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient's pulmonary nodule? (E) Reassurance (C) Follow-up chest x-ray in 12 months (D) Follow-up CT scan in 12 months (A) Antituberculous therapy (B) Positron emission tomography
Reason: The answer is (B) Positron emission tomography. 

The irregular, scalloped borders of the pulmonary nodule, along with the patient's smoking history and age, raise concern for malignancy. A PET scan can help assess the metabolic activity of the nodule and distinguish between benign and malignant lesions, guiding further management.
Answer: (B) Positron emission tomography

Question: A 14-year-old girl is brought to the physician after she accidentally cut her right forearm earlier that morning while working with her mother's embroidery scissors. She has no history of serious illness. The mother says she went to elementary and middle school abroad and is not sure if she received all of her childhood vaccinations. She appears healthy. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6 °F), pulse 90/min, and blood pressure is 102/68 mm Hg. Examination shows a clean 2-cm laceration on her right forearm with surrounding edema. There is no erythema or discharge. The wound is irrigated with water and washed with soap. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? (B) Intravenous metronidazole (E) No further steps are necessary (A) Administer DTaP only (D) Administer TIG only (C) Administer Tdap only
Reason: The answer is (C) Administer Tdap only.

Given the patient's age and the nature of her laceration, it is important to ensure she is appropriately vaccinated against tetanus, particularly since her vaccination history is uncertain. Tdap is recommended for adolescents and adults for protection against tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis, and administering it would provide necessary coverage and increase her immunization status regarding tetanus.
Answer: (C) Administer Tdap only

Question: A 34-year-old woman visits a fertility clinic with her husband with concerns about their inability to conceive their first child. Originally from India, she met her present husband during a humanitarian mission in Nepal 10 years ago. In addition, she reports a long history of vague lower abdominal pain along with changes in her menstrual cycle such as spotting and irregular vaginal bleeding with passage of clots for the past few months. The patient denies pain during intercourse, postcoital bleeding, foul-smelling vaginal discharge, fever, and weight loss. Her physical examination is unremarkable with no signs of acute illness. During the physical examination, a healthy vagina and mild bleeding from the cervix are noted. The patient is subjected to a hysterosalpingogram as part of her infertility evaluation, which shows sinus formation and peritubal adhesions. Subsequently, a sample of menstrual fluid is taken to the microbiology lab. Which of the following pathogens is more likely to be the cause of this patient’s complaints? (C) Streptococcus agalactiae (B) Chlamydia trachomatis (A) Neisseria gonorrhoeae (D) Mycoplasma genitalium (E) Mycobacterium tuberculosis
Reason: Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a likely cause of this patient's symptoms given her history and the findings from the hysterosalpingogram showing peritubal adhesions and sinus formation. This suggests a granulomatous infection, which is characteristic of genital tuberculosis, especially in women from regions where the disease is more prevalent, such as India, and can present with infertility and abnormal bleeding patterns.
Answer: (E) Mycobacterium tuberculosis

Question: A previously healthy 49-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of chest pain that radiates to her back. The pain started 45 minutes ago while she was having lunch. Over the past 3 months, she has frequently had the feeling of food, both liquid and solid, getting “stuck” in her chest while she is eating. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits. An ECG shows a normal sinus rhythm with no ST-segment abnormalities. An esophagogram is shown. Further evaluation is most likely to show which of the following? (C) Elevated lower esophageal sphincter pressure on manometry (D) Gastroesophageal junction mass on endoscopy (A) Simultaneous multi-peak contractions on manometry (E) Hypertensive contractions on manometry (B) Multiple mucosal erosions on endoscopy
Reason: Simultaneous multi-peak contractions on manometry are indicative of a disorder known as esophageal spasm, which fits with this patient's description of chest pain and the sensation of food getting stuck. These symptoms, along with the normal ECG ruling out cardiac causes, suggest a functional esophageal disorder, and the specific findings on manometry would be consistent with esophageal motility issues typically seen in spasms.
Answer: (A) Simultaneous multi-peak contractions on manometry

Question: A 52-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of generalized fatigue, low-grade fever, and a 10-kg (22-lb) weight loss. Physical examination shows generalized pallor and splenomegaly. Her hemoglobin concentration is 7.5 g/dL and leukocyte count is 41,800/mm3. Leukocyte alkaline phosphatase activity is low. Peripheral blood smear shows basophilia with myelocytes and metamyelocytes. Bone marrow biopsy shows cellular hyperplasia with proliferation of immature granulocytic cells. Which of the following mechanisms is most likely responsible for this patient's condition? (B) Cytokine-independent activation of the JAK-STAT pathway (D) Altered expression of the retinoic acid receptor gene (C) Loss of function of the APC gene (E) Unregulated expression of the ABL1 gene (A) Overexpression of the c-KIT gene
Reason: The unregulated expression of the ABL1 gene, particularly in the context of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), is linked to the Philadelphia chromosome, which results from a translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22. Given this patient's symptoms, including severe leukocytosis, splenomegaly, and the peripheral blood finding of myelocytes and metamyelocytes, the mechanism of ABL1 gene dysregulation aligns with the classic presentation of CML.
Answer: (E) Unregulated expression of the ABL1 gene

Question: A 70-year-old woman is brought to her physician by her daughter who reports that the patient has been increasingly confused and forgetful over the past year. The daughter reports that the patient has difficulty finding words, remembering names, and maintaining a conversation. She has gotten lost twice while driving. Her past medical history is known for obesity, diabetes, and atrial fibrillation. She takes metformin, glyburide, and warfarin. She drinks socially and has a 30 pack-year smoking history. Her family history is notable for Parkinson’s disease in her father and stroke in her mother. A head CT demonstrates sulcal widening and narrowing of the gyri. The physician decides to start the patient on a medication known to inhibit a cell surface glutamate receptor. Which of the following is a downstream effect of this medication? (E) Decreased intracellular acetylcholine (D) Increased intracellular acetylcholine (B) Increased intracellular calcium (A) Decreased intracellular calcium (C) Increased intracellular sodium
Reason: The reasoning behind the answer is that medications inhibiting cell surface glutamate receptors, such as NMDA antagonists, ultimately reduce calcium influx into neurons. Glutamate is a major excitatory neurotransmitter, and excessive activation of its receptors can lead to increased intracellular calcium levels, which is associated with excitotoxicity. Therefore, inhibiting these receptors would lead to a decrease in intracellular calcium levels.
Answer: (A) Decreased intracellular calcium

Question: A 65-year-old non-smoking woman with no symptoms comes to your clinic to establish care with a primary care provider. She hasn’t seen a doctor in 12 years and states that she feels very healthy. You realize that guidelines by the national cancer organization suggest that she is due for some cancer screening tests, including a mammogram for breast cancer, a colonoscopy for colon cancer, and a pap smear for cervical cancer. These three screening tests are most likely to be considered which of the following? (A) Primary prevention (E) Cancer screening does not fit into these categories (B) Secondary prevention (C) Tertiary prevention (D) Quaternary prevention
Reason: The reasoning behind the answer is that secondary prevention involves screening methods aimed at detecting diseases early in asymptomatic individuals to enable timely intervention and improve outcomes. In this case, the mammogram, colonoscopy, and pap smear are all tests designed to identify cancer at an early stage before symptoms appear, fitting the definition of secondary prevention.

Question: A 35-year-old woman presents to the ER with shortness of breath, cough, and severe lower limb enlargement. The dyspnea was of sudden onset, started a week ago, and increased with exercise but did not disappear with rest. Her cough was dry, persistent, and non-productive. She has a family history of maternal hypertension. Her vital signs include heart rate 106/min, respiratory rate 28/min, and blood pressure 140/90 mm Hg. On physical examination, thoracic expansion was diminished on the right side with rhonchi and crackles on the lower two-thirds of both sides, with left predominance. A systolic murmur was heard on the tricuspid foci, which increased in intensity with inspiration. There was jugular engorgement when the bed was placed at 50°. Palpation of the abdomen was painful on the right hypochondrium, with hepatomegaly 4 cm below the lower coastal edge. Hepatojugular reflux was present. Soft, painless, pitting edema was present in both lower limbs up until the middle third of both legs. Lung computed tomography (CT) and transthoracic echocardiogram were performed and detected right heart failure and severe pulmonary fibrosis. What is the most likely diagnosis? (B) Coronary artery disease (A) Left-sided heart failure (E) Cor pulmonale (D) Budd-chiari syndrome (C) Liver disease
Reason: The most likely diagnosis is (E) Cor pulmonale because the patient's symptoms indicate right heart failure, which is often caused by increased pressure in the pulmonary vasculature due to conditions such as severe pulmonary fibrosis. The clinical signs, such as jugular vein distension, soft pitting edema, and the specific auscultatory findings mentioned, support the diagnosis of cor pulmonale resulting from the underlying lung pathology.

Question: A 26-year-old primigravid woman at 25 weeks' gestation comes to the physician for a prenatal visit. She has no history of serious illness and her only medication is a daily prenatal vitamin. A 1-hour 50-g glucose challenge shows a glucose concentration of 167 mg/dL (N < 135). A 100-g oral glucose tolerance test shows glucose concentrations of 213 mg/dL (N < 180) and 165 mg/dL (N < 140) at 1 and 3 hours, respectively. If she does not receive adequate treatment for her condition, which of the following complications is her infant at greatest risk of developing? (E) Decreased hematocrit (A) Elevated calcium levels (B) Islet cell hyperplasia (C) Decreased amniotic fluid production (D) Omphalocele
Reason: The correct answer is (B) Islet cell hyperplasia because, in cases of gestational diabetes, the elevated maternal blood glucose levels lead to increased fetal insulin production. This can stimulate the development and proliferation of the islet cells in the pancreas, resulting in hyperplasia, as the fetus attempts to manage the higher glucose levels and can later lead to complications such as neonatal hypoglycemia.
Answer: (B) Islet cell hyperplasia

Question: A 55-year-old man comes to the physician because of intermittent palpitations that occur when he is stressed, exercising, or when he drinks alcohol. Physical examination shows an irregularly irregular pulse. An ECG shows irregular QRS complexes without any discrete P waves. Pharmacotherapy with carvedilol is initiated for his condition. Compared to treatment with propranolol, which of the following adverse effects is most likely? (B) Hypotension (E) Bronchospasm (D) Hyperglycemia (C) Bradycardia (A) Hyperkalemia
Reason: The most likely adverse effect of carvedilol compared to propranolol is (B) Hypotension, as carvedilol is a non-selective beta-blocker that also has alpha-blocking properties, which can lead to vasodilation and a decrease in blood pressure. While both medications can cause bradycardia, carvedilol's additional action on alpha receptors makes it more likely to induce hypotension, especially in patients who may already have compromised hemodynamics.

Question: An institutionalized 65-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of abdominal pain and distension for 12 hours. The pain was acute in onset and is a cramping-type pain associated with nausea, vomiting, and constipation. He has a history of chronic constipation and has used laxatives for years. There is no history of inflammatory bowel disease in his family. He has not been hospitalized recently. There is no recent history of weight loss or change in bowel habits. On physical examination, the patient appears ill. The abdomen is distended with tenderness mainly in the left lower quadrant and is tympanic on percussion. The blood pressure is 110/79 mm Hg, heart rate is 100/min, the respiratory rate is 20/min, and the temperature is 37.2°C (99.0°F). The CBC shows an elevated white blood cell count. The plain abdominal X-ray is shown in the accompanying image. What is the most likely cause of his condition? (A) Acute diverticulitis (E) Colon cancer (D) Intussusception (B) Toxic megacolon (C) Sigmoid volvulus
Reason: The patient's symptoms, including acute onset of cramping abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, constipation, and the physical examination findings of abdominal distension and tenderness, suggest a bowel obstruction. Specifically, the left lower quadrant tenderness and distension are characteristic of sigmoid volvulus, which occurs when the sigmoid colon twists on itself, leading to an obstructive and potentially ischemic condition. The history of chronic constipation and laxative use may also contribute to the risk of this type of obstruction.

Question: A 4-year-old male is evaluated for frequent epistaxis and mucous membrane bleeding. Physical examination shows diffuse petechiae on the patient’s distal extremities. Peripheral blood smear shows an absence of platelet clumping. An ELISA binding assay reveals that platelet surfaces are deficient in GIIb/IIIa receptors. Serum platelet count is normal. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? (D) Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (E) Glanzmann’s thrombasthenia (A) Hemophilia A (C) Bernard-Soulier disease (B) Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura
Reason: The patient's symptoms of frequent epistaxis and mucous membrane bleeding, alongside the presence of diffuse petechiae and a normal platelet count, suggest a bleeding disorder related to platelet function rather than platelet quantity. The specific finding of deficient GIIb/IIIa receptors indicates a defect in platelet aggregation, which is characteristic of Glanzmann’s thrombasthenia, a hereditary condition affecting the ability of platelets to clump together and form a proper clot.

Question: A 50-year-old man presents with a 3-day history of painful peeling of his skin. He says he initially noted small erythematous spots on areas of his neck, but this quickly spread to his torso, face, and buttocks to form flaccid blisters and areas of epidermal detachment involving > 40% of his total body surface area. He describes the associated pain as severe, burning, and generalized over his entire body. The patient does recall having an episode with similar symptoms 10 years ago after taking an unknown antibiotic for community-acquired pneumonia, but the symptoms were nowhere near this severe. He denies any fever, chills, palpitations, dizziness, or trouble breathing. Past medical history is significant for a urinary tract infection (UTI) diagnosed 1 week ago for which he has been taking ciprofloxacin. His vital signs include: blood pressure, 130/90 mm Hg; temperature, 37.7℃ (99.9℉); respiratory, rate 22/min; and pulse, 110/min. On physical examination, the patient is ill-appearing and in acute distress due to pain. The epidermis sloughing involves areas of the face, back, torso, buttocks, and thighs bilaterally, and its appearance is shown in the exhibit (see image). Nikolsky sign is positive. Laboratory findings are unremarkable. Which of the following is the next best diagnostic step in this patient? (E) PCR for serum staphylococcal exfoliative toxin (C) Blood cultures (D) Skin biopsy and histopathologic analysis (A) Direct immunofluorescence on perilesional biopsy (B) Indirect immunofluorescence on perilesional biopsy
Reason: The best next diagnostic step in this case is a skin biopsy and histopathologic analysis to determine the underlying etiology of the patient's symptoms, which are suggestive of a severe skin condition such as toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) or Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS). Given the significant skin detachment and history of previous similar reactions to medication, histopathological examination will help differentiate between these conditions and guide management.

The patient is concerned about pneumococcal infection. He has never been vaccinated against pneumococcus, and he would like to get the appropriate vaccination. You advise him that he should not be vaccinated with PCV13 (pneumococcal conjugate vaccine) and should instead be administered PPSV23 (pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine). Why is PCV13 contraindicated in this patient? (C) He had an allergic reaction to the Tdap vaccination. (E) He has hyperlipidemia. (A) It is contraindicated in patients over the age of 65 years. (D) He takes aspirin. (B) He has a history of intussusception.
Reason: The correct answer is actually not (C) but rather none of the options provided are appropriate; PCV13 is not contraindicated due to an allergic reaction to Tdap, nor does it relate to hyperlipidemia, aspirin use, or intussusception. The main reason to favor PPSV23 over PCV13 in this patient is generally related to age and the specific recommendations for pneumococcal vaccination in older adults, suggesting that individuals over 65 usually receive PPSV23 as part of their immunization plan. The incorrect mention of the allergic reaction could list it as a concern but is not directly an auto contraindication for the conjugate vaccine. 

In summary, older adults typically receive PPSV23, making PCV13 less favorable in this context.
Answer: (C) He had an allergic reaction to the Tdap vaccination.

Question: A 20-year-old man is brought to the emergency department for evaluation of an animal bite. He was hiking earlier that day when he was bitten by a raccoon. He says the attack was unprovoked and the animal ran away after the encounter. He was bitten by a stray dog when he was 11 years old and received postexposure prophylaxis for rabies at that time. His immunizations are up-to-date. His immunization record shows he received 3 doses of diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis vaccine as a child and a tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis vaccination at the age of 16. He is in no apparent distress. His temperature is 98.4°F (36.9°C), pulse is 72/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 124/75 mm Hg. He has a wound on his left lower extremity with actively bleeding puncture sites. The wound is thoroughly irrigated with normal saline and cleansed with antiseptic and a bandage is applied. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? (C) Rabies immunoglobulin and vaccine (A) No action needed (D) Tetanus booster (B) Tetanus booster, rabies immunoglobulin (E) Rabies vaccination
Reason: The appropriate answer is (E) Rabies vaccination because a raccoon is a known vector for rabies, and given that the bite was unprovoked and the animal ran away, there is a high risk of rabies exposure. Since the patient remains uncertain about the rabies vaccination schedule and does not appear to have received a rabies vaccine after the initial exposure at age 11, timely vaccination is essential to prevent the onset of the disease.

His wife explains that he injured himself about a week ago while cooking, and several days later his finger became infected, oozing with pus. He ignored her warning to see a doctor and even refused after he developed fever, chills, and severe fatigue yesterday. After being seen by the emergency physician, he was given antibiotics and IV fluids. Following initial resuscitation with IV fluids, he remains hypotensive. The ED physicians place a central venous catheter and begin infusing norepinephrine. Which of the following receptors are activated by norepinephrine? (A) Alpha 1 (B) Alpha 2 (E) Alpha 1, Beta 1, Dopamine 1 (D) Alpha 1, Alpha 2, Beta 1, Beta 2 (C) Alpha 1, Alpha 2, Beta 1
Reason: The correct answer is (C) Alpha 1, Alpha 2, Beta 1. Norepinephrine primarily acts on alpha-1 adrenergic receptors, which cause vasoconstriction and increase blood pressure, and it also activates beta-1 adrenergic receptors, which increase heart rate and contractility. While it does interact with alpha-2 receptors, its main therapeutic effects in the context of severe hypotension and shock are mediated through alpha-1 and beta-1 receptor activation, making option C the most accurate choice.

Question: An 8-year-old boy is shifted to a post-surgical floor following neck surgery. The surgeon has restricted his oral intake for the next 24 hours. He does not have diarrhea, vomiting, or dehydration. His calculated fluid requirement is 1500 mL/day. However, he receives 2000 mL of intravenous isotonic fluids over 24 hours. Which of the following physiological parameters in the boy’s circulatory system is most likely to be increased? (C) Interstitial hydrostatic pressure (A) Capillary wall permeability (D) Capillary oncotic pressure (E) Interstitial oncotic pressure (B) Capillary hydrostatic pressure
Reason: The answer is (B) Capillary hydrostatic pressure because when a patient receives excess intravenous fluids, it leads to an increased volume of blood in the circulatory system. This elevated blood volume results in increased pressure within the capillaries, specifically the hydrostatic pressure, which pushes fluid out of the capillaries into the interstitial space, potentially contributing to edema.

Question: An investigator studying hormone synthesis and transport uses immunocytochemical techniques to localize a carrier protein in the central nervous system of an experimental animal. The investigator finds that this protein is synthesized together with a specific hormone from a composite precursor. The protein is involved in the transport of the hormone from the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei to its destination. The hormone transported by these carrier proteins is most likely responsible for which of the following functions? (D) Upregulation of renal aquaporin-2 channels (C) Increased insulin-like growth factor 1 production (A) Hyperplasia of the adrenal zona fasciculata (E) Stimulation of thyroglobulin cleavage (B) Maturation of primordial germ cells
Reason: The answer is (D) Upregulation of renal aquaporin-2 channels because the description suggests that the hormone being transported is likely vasopressin (also known as antidiuretic hormone or ADH), which is synthesized in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus. Vasopressin's primary role is to increase water reabsorption in the kidneys by upregulating the expression of aquaporin-2 channels in the collecting ducts, thus regulating fluid balance in the body.

Question: In a lab experiment, a researcher treats early cells of the erythrocyte lineage with a novel compound called Pb82. Pb82 blocks the first step of heme synthesis. However, the experiment is controlled such that the cells otherwise continue to develop into erythrocytes. At the end of the experiment, the cells have developed into normal erythrocytes except that they are devoid of heme. A second compound, anti-Pb82 is administered which removes the effect of Pb82.

Which of the following is likely to be true of the mature red blood cells in this study? (E) The cells will not produce heme because they lack iron (B) The cells will not produce heme since they lack mitochondria (C) The cells will not produce heme because they lack cytosol (D) The cells will not produce heme because they lack nucleoli (A) The cells will now produce heme
Reason: The answer is (B) The cells will not produce heme since they lack mitochondria because mature erythrocytes (red blood cells) typically lose their mitochondria during development. Heme synthesis is primarily initiated in the mitochondria, and without them, the cells cannot carry out the necessary enzymatic steps to produce heme, which is crucial for hemoglobin function. 
Answer: (B) The cells will not produce heme since they lack mitochondria

Bystanders reported to the police that they had seen the man as he exited a local bar, and he was subsequently assaulted. He sustained severe facial trauma, including multiple lacerations and facial bone fractures. The man is taken to the operating room by the ENT team, who attempt to reconstruct his facial bones with multiple plates and screws. Several days later, he complains of the inability to open his mouth wide or to completely chew his food, both of which he seemed able to do prior to surgery. Which of the following is a characteristic of the injured nerve branch? (E) Sympathetic component only (D) Parasympathetic component only (A) Sensory component only (B) Voluntary motor component only (C) Voluntary motor and sensory components
Reason: The correct answer is (C) Voluntary motor and sensory components. This is because the inability to open the mouth wide or chew could indicate injury to the mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve (V3), which provides both motor innervation to the muscles of mastication and sensory innervation to the lower face. The symptoms following the surgery align with this nerve's functions, as both motor and sensory components are implicated in the ability to chew and perform movements of the jaw.
Answer: (C) Voluntary motor and sensory components

Question: A 52-year-old man is admitted directly from the clinic for a serum glucose of 980 mg/dL. He has had type 2 diabetes for 16 years, for which he was prescribed metformin and glimepiride; however, he reports not having followed his prescription due to its high cost. For the past 12 days, he has had excess urination, and has lost 6 kg in weight. He has also noted a progressively worsening cough productive of greenish-brown sputum for approximately 20 days. His temperature is 38.9°C (102.02°F), blood pressure is 97/62 mm Hg, pulse is 97/minute and respiratory rate is 26/minute. On physical examination, he is somnolent, his eyes are sunken, and there are crackles at the left lung base.
Lab results are shown:
Arterial pH: 7.33
Serum sodium: 130 mEq/L
Serum potassium: 3 mEq/L
Serum osmolality: 325 mOsm/kg
Serum beta-hydroxybutyrate: negative
Urinalysis: trace ketones
Intravenous normal saline infusion is started. Which of the following is the best next step in this patient? (C) Adding dopamine infusion (E) Starting basal-bolus insulin (B) Adding potassium to the intravenous fluids (A) Starting regular insulin infusion (D) Adding sodium bicarbonate infusion
Reason: The correct answer is (B) Adding potassium to the intravenous fluids. This patient presents with signs of potential hyperglycemic crisis, but his serum potassium level is notably low at 3 mEq/L, which indicates hypokalemia. When treating conditions such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state, it is crucial to monitor and replace potassium, as insulin therapy can lower potassium levels further, which could lead to serious complications.
Answer: (B) Adding potassium to the intravenous fluids

Question: A previously healthy 46-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of fatigue and progressive shortness of breath. She does not take any medications. Her pulse is 93/min and blood pressure is 112/80 mm Hg. Examination shows no abnormalities. Her hemoglobin concentration is 8 g/dL, leukocyte count is 22,000/mm3, and platelet count is 80,000/mm3. A peripheral blood smear shows increased numbers of circulating myeloblasts. Bone marrow biopsy confirms the diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia. ECG, x-ray of the chest, and echocardiogram show no abnormalities. The patient is scheduled to start induction chemotherapy with cytarabine and daunorubicin. This patient is at increased risk for which of the following long-term complications? (E) Left ventricular dysfunction (D) Endometrial hyperplasia (C) Decreased diffusing capacity of of the lung for carbon dioxide (A) Bilateral tinnitus (B) Gross hematuria
Reason: The correct answer is (E) Left ventricular dysfunction. Patients undergoing induction chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia, particularly with agents like daunorubicin, are at an increased risk for cardiotoxicity and subsequent left ventricular dysfunction due to the dose-dependent effect of anthracycline compounds on cardiac muscle. Long-term monitoring of cardiac function in these patients is crucial to manage and mitigate this risk effectively.
Answer: (E) Left ventricular dysfunction

[INFO] Opinion paths:
Path 1: To determine the expected blood smear findings in a patient with a mutation in the Kozak sequence affecting the translation of the Beta-globin mRNA, we need to consider the effects of this mutation on hemoglobin production.

Thalassemia intermedia is characterized by a moderate deficiency in the production of beta-globin chains. This results in an imbalance between alpha and beta globin chains, leading to ineffective erythropoiesis and various morphological changes in red blood cells.

Now we analyze the options:

- (E) Ringed sideroblasts: These are typically seen in conditions like sideroblastic anemia but are not characteristic of thalassemia.
- (A) Macrocytic red blood cells: These are usually seen in cases of vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, not thalassemia.
- (C) Microcytic red blood cells: Thalassemia is often associated with microcytic anemia due to inadequate hemoglobin production.
- (D) Bite cells: These are associated with oxidative damage and are typically seen in conditions like G6PD deficiency.
- (B) Hyperchromic red blood cells: This is not a typical finding in thalassemia.

Given the pathophysiology of thalassemia intermedia, we can conclude that the blood smear would most likely show:

**Answer: (C) Microcytic red blood cells.**
Path 2: To answer this question, let's analyze the context provided:

1. **Kozak Sequence**: The Kozak sequence is a consensus sequence surrounding the start codon of an mRNA that is important for the initiation of translation. A mutation here may affect the efficiency of translation.

2. **Beta-globin Gene Mutation**: The mutation described leads to a decrease in the translation of Beta-globin mRNA, resulting in thalassemia intermedia, which is characterized by reduced production of hemoglobin.

3. **Thalassemia Intermedia**: This condition typically involves a reduction in the amount of hemoglobin produced, leading to an imbalance between alpha and beta globin chains. As a result, the red blood cells are often smaller and contain less hemoglobin than normal.

4. **Blood Smear Findings**: In thalassemia, specifically thalassemia intermedia, we would expect to see microcytic red blood cells due to the reduced hemoglobin synthesis.

Given these points, the expected blood smear in a patient with a mutation in the Kozak sequence of the Beta-globin gene leading to thalassemia intermedia is:

**Answer: (C) Microcytic red blood cells**.
Path 3: To analyze this question step by step:

1. **Understanding Thalassemia Intermedia**: Thalassemia intermedia is typically characterized by a moderate decrease in the production of hemoglobin due to mutations affecting the globin genes. In this case, the beta-globin gene's Kozak sequence mutation leads to reduced translation, resulting in decreased beta-globin chain production.

2. **Impact on Red Blood Cell Morphology**: In beta-thalassemia, the reduced production of beta-globin chains leads to an imbalance in alpha and beta globin chains, which can result in ineffective erythropoiesis and microcytic anemia.

3. **Blood Smear Findings**: The most characteristic finding in beta-thalassemia (including thalassemia intermedia) is microcytic red blood cells due to the inadequate hemoglobin production relative to the red blood cell volume.

Now considering the options:
- (E) Ringed sideroblasts: Typically associated with sideroblastic anemias, not thalassemia.
- (A) Macrocytic red blood cells: Not typical for thalassemia.
- (C) Microcytic red blood cells: Consistent with thalassemia due to reduced hemoglobin synthesis.
- (D) Bite cells: Associated with oxidative damage, not specific to thalassemia.
- (B) Hyperchromic red blood cells: Not a classic finding in thalassemia.

Given this analysis, the correct answer is:

**Answer: (C) Microcytic red blood cells**
Path 4: To answer this question, let's analyze the information provided step by step:

1. **Understanding Thalassemia Intermedia**: Thalassemia intermedia is a form of thalassemia that results in reduced production of hemoglobin due to mutations affecting the globin chains. In this case, the mutation affects the translation of the Beta-globin mRNA, which is crucial for the formation of hemoglobin.

2. **Expected Blood Smear Findings**:
   - **Microcytic Red Blood Cells**: Thalassemia is typically characterized by microcytic anemia, meaning the red blood cells are smaller than normal due to insufficient hemoglobin production. This is a common feature of beta-thalassemia.
   - **Other Options**:
     - **Ringed sideroblasts** are typically associated with sideroblastic anemia, not thalassemia.
     - **Macrocytic red blood cells** are usually seen in conditions like vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, which is not typical of thalassemia.
     - **Bite cells** are associated with oxidative stress (e.g., G6PD deficiency) and not specifically with thalassemia.
     - **Hyperchromic red blood cells** indicates increased hemoglobin concentration, which is not typical in thalassemia.

3. **Conclusion**: Given that thalassemia intermedia typically leads to microcytic red blood cells due to the decreased production of beta-globin chains, the blood smear would likely show microcytic red blood cells.

Therefore, the answer is:

**Answer: (C) Microcytic red blood cells**
Path 5: Let's analyze the question step by step:

1. **Understanding Thalassemia Intermedia**: Thalassemia intermedia is a form of thalassemia that results in a moderate decrease in the production of hemoglobin, leading to a mild to moderate anemia. It is characterized by ineffective erythropoiesis and can lead to various changes in the morphology of red blood cells.

2. **Kozak Sequence Mutation**: The Kozak sequence is critical for the initiation of translation. A mutation that decreases the translation of beta-globin mRNA would lead to reduced production of hemoglobin, which is primarily composed of alpha and beta chains. In thalassemia, particularly beta-thalassemia, there is an imbalance in the production of these chains.

3. **Expected Blood Smear Findings**: In patients with beta-thalassemia, the blood smear typically shows microcytic red blood cells due to the reduced hemoglobin content. This occurs because the body compensates for the lack of normal hemoglobin by producing red blood cells that are smaller in size (microcytic).

4. **Reviewing the Options**:
   - (E) Ringed sideroblasts: Typically seen in sideroblastic anemia.
   - (A) Macrocytic red blood cells: Characteristic of vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, not thalassemia.
   - (C) Microcytic red blood cells: Expected in beta-thalassemia due to reduced hemoglobin production.
   - (D) Bite cells: Associated with oxidative damage or splenic processes, not directly linked to thalassemia.
   - (B) Hyperchromic red blood cells: Not characteristic of thalassemia.

Based on this analysis, the most expected blood smear finding for a patient with a mutation leading to thalassemia intermedia would be:

**Answer: (C) Microcytic red blood cells**
Path 6: Let's analyze the question step by step. 

The Kozak sequence is crucial for the initiation of translation in eukaryotic cells, and mutations in this sequence can lead to reduced protein synthesis. In the case of beta-thalassemia intermedia, which is characterized by a partial deficiency in beta-globin production, the resulting phenotype often manifests as microcytic anemia.

Now, considering the options provided:

- (E) Ringed sideroblasts: These are typically associated with conditions such as sideroblastic anemia, not thalassemia.
- (A) Macrocytic red blood cells: Macrocytosis is often seen in conditions such as vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, not typically in thalassemia.
- (C) Microcytic red blood cells: This is characteristic of beta-thalassemia due to the reduced production of hemoglobin, leading to smaller red blood cells.
- (D) Bite cells: These are associated with oxidative damage to red blood cells and are seen in G6PD deficiency, not thalassemia.
- (B) Hyperchromic red blood cells: While hyperchromic cells can be seen in some hemolytic anemias, they are not typical in beta-thalassemia.

Given this analysis, the expected blood smear in a patient with beta-thalassemia intermedia due to a mutation in the Kozak sequence of the beta-globin gene would show:

Answer: (C) Microcytic red blood cells.
Path 7: Let's think through the question step by step.

The Kozak sequence is important for the initiation of translation in eukaryotic cells, and mutations in this sequence can lead to decreased protein synthesis. In the case of the beta-globin gene, a mutation that decreases translation can lead to reduced levels of functional hemoglobin, which is characteristic of thalassemia.

Thalassemia is typically associated with microcytic anemia due to the reduced production of hemoglobin, leading to smaller red blood cells. In the case of beta-thalassemia, the blood smear usually shows:

- Microcytic red blood cells, which are smaller than normal red blood cells.
- Hypochromic red blood cells, which have less hemoglobin.

Since the question specifically refers to the expected findings in a patient with a mutation in the Kozak sequence of the beta-globin gene leading to thalassemia intermedia, the most appropriate answer is:

(C) Microcytic red blood cells.
Path 8: Let's analyze the question step by step.

1. **Understanding Thalassemia Intermedia**: Thalassemia intermedia is typically characterized by a moderate decrease in the production of hemoglobin due to mutations affecting globin gene expression. In the case of beta-thalassemia, the beta-globin chain production is reduced, leading to an imbalance between alpha and beta chains.

2. **Blood Smear Characteristics**: In beta-thalassemia, especially thalassemia intermedia, the blood smear typically shows:
   - Microcytic red blood cells due to the reduced hemoglobin content, which results in smaller-than-normal erythrocytes.
   - Hypochromic red blood cells because of lower hemoglobin levels.

3. **Evaluating the Options**:
   - (E) Ringed sideroblasts: These are typically seen in sideroblastic anemia, not thalassemia.
   - (A) Macrocytic red blood cells: This is more characteristic of conditions like vitamin B12 or folate deficiency.
   - (C) Microcytic red blood cells: This option is consistent with thalassemia intermedia due to the reduced hemoglobin synthesis.
   - (D) Bite cells: These are associated with oxidative stress and are seen in conditions like G6PD deficiency.
   - (B) Hyperchromic red blood cells: This is not typically seen in thalassemia.

Given the context of the mutation leading to thalassemia intermedia, the expected blood smear would show:

**Answer: (C) Microcytic red blood cells**.
Path 9: To answer this question, let's analyze the situation step by step.

1. **Understanding Thalassemia Intermedia**: Thalassemia intermedia is a form of thalassemia characterized by a moderate decrease in the production of hemoglobin. It often leads to an imbalance in the production of alpha and beta globin chains, typically resulting in microcytic anemia.

2. **Kozak Sequence Mutation**: The question states that there is a mutation in the Kozak sequence of the Beta-globin gene that decreases translation. This means that there will be less beta globin produced, which could lead to an excess of alpha globin chains, causing an imbalance.

3. **Blood Smear Characteristics**: In thalassemia, particularly beta-thalassemia, the blood smear typically shows:
   - Microcytic red blood cells (smaller than normal due to decreased hemoglobin content).
   - Hypochromic red blood cells (less color due to decreased hemoglobin).

4. **Evaluating the Options**:
   - (E) Ringed sideroblasts: These are associated with sideroblastic anemia, not typically seen in thalassemia.
   - (A) Macrocytic red blood cells: Not characteristic of thalassemia; usually, these are larger cells seen in vitamin B12 or folate deficiencies.
   - (C) Microcytic red blood cells: This is consistent with thalassemia and the expected finding in this case.
   - (D) Bite cells: Usually associated with oxidative stress or G6PD deficiency, not typical for thalassemia.
   - (B) Hyperchromic red blood cells: This is not a typical finding in thalassemia; cells are generally hypochromic.

Given this information, the most accurate answer is:

**Answer: (C) Microcytic red blood cells**.
Path 10: Let's analyze the question step by step. 

The question mentions a mutation in the Kozak sequence of the Beta-globin gene that results in decreased translation of the Beta-globin mRNA, leading to thalassemia intermedia. Thalassemia intermedia is characterized by a moderate reduction in hemoglobin production due to mutations affecting the synthesis of hemoglobin chains.

In thalassemia, one of the hallmark findings on a blood smear is microcytic red blood cells. This is due to the reduced hemoglobin production, which leads to smaller red blood cells (microcytosis) as the body attempts to compensate for the decreased hemoglobin levels.

Let's evaluate the options:
- (E) Ringed sideroblasts: These are typically seen in sideroblastic anemia, not thalassemia.
- (A) Macrocytic red blood cells: This is seen in conditions like vitamin B12 deficiency or folate deficiency, not in thalassemia.
- (C) Microcytic red blood cells: This is a classic finding in thalassemia due to decreased hemoglobin synthesis.
- (D) Bite cells: These are associated with oxidative damage and are seen in conditions like G6PD deficiency, not specifically in thalassemia.
- (B) Hyperchromic red blood cells: This is not a typical finding in thalassemia.

Based on this analysis, the expected finding on the blood smear for a patient with thalassemia intermedia due to a mutation in the Beta-globin gene is:

Answer: (C) Microcytic red blood cells.

Question: A 27-year-old woman comes to the physician for a routine health maintenance examination. She feels well. She had a chlamydia infection at the age of 22 years that was treated. Her only medication is an oral contraceptive. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 6 years. She has recently been sexually active with 3 male partners and uses condoms inconsistently. Her last Pap test was 4 years ago and results were normal. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. A Pap test shows atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? (B) Perform loop electrosurgical excision procedure (E) Perform laser ablation (A) Perform cervical biopsy (D) Repeat cytology in 6 months (C) Perform HPV testing
Reason: The most appropriate next step in managing the patient with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) on her Pap test is to perform HPV testing. This is because the management of ASC-US results is guided by the presence or absence of high-risk HPV; if high-risk HPV is detected, further evaluation or intervention may be warranted, while a negative HPV test may allow for routine follow-up.
Answer: (C) Perform HPV testing

Upon arrival, his blood pressure is 104/60 mm Hg, pulse is 102/min, respiratory rate is 25/min, body temperature is 36.5°C (97.7°F), and oxygen saturation is 94% on room air. An electrocardiogram shows an ST-segment elevation in I, aVL, and V5-6. The patient is transferred to the cardiac interventional suite for a percutaneous coronary intervention. The patient is admitted to the hospital after successful revascularization. During his first night on the ICU floor his urinary output is 0.15 mL/kg/h. Urinalysis shows muddy brown casts. Which of the following outcomes specific to the patient’s condition would you expect to find? (E) FENa+ < 1% (C) Blood urea nitrogen (BUN):Serum creatinine ratio (Cr) > 20:1 (A) Urinary osmolality 900 mOsmol/kg (normal: 500–800 mOsmol/kg) (B) Urinary osmolality 550 mOsmol/kg (normal: 500–800 mOsmol/kg) (D) Blood urea nitrogen (BUN):Serum creatinine ratio (Cr) < 15:1
Reason: The expected outcome in this patient, who likely has acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to ischemia following an acute myocardial infarction, is a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) to serum creatinine ratio of less than 15:1. This is because ATN typically leads to a lower BUN-to-creatinine ratio, whereas pre-renal causes of acute kidney injury usually show a ratio greater than 20:1 due to a high reabsorption of urea in a state of low renal perfusion.
Answer: (D) Blood urea nitrogen (BUN):Serum creatinine ratio (Cr) < 15:1

Question: A mother with HIV has given birth to a healthy boy 2 days ago. She takes her antiretroviral medication regularly and is compliant with the therapy. Before being discharged, her doctor explains that she cannot breastfeed the child since there is a risk of infection through breastfeeding and stresses that the child can benefit from formula feeding. The physician stresses the importance of not overheating the formula since Vitamin C may be inactivated by overheating. Which process could be impaired if the mother boiled the formula longer than needed? (A) Heme synthesis (D) Protein catabolism (B) Purine synthesis (C) Collagen synthesis (E) Fatty acid metabolism
Reason: The process that could be impaired if the mother boiled the formula longer than needed is likely (C) Collagen synthesis. This is because overheating can denature proteins, including those necessary for collagen formation, leading to potential deficiencies in collagen synthesis, which is essential for the structural integrity of tissues. Vitamin C is a crucial cofactor for enzymes involved in collagen production, so its inactivation due to heat may adversely affect this process.

Question: A 2-year-old boy is brought to a pediatrician for recurrent respiratory infections. The parents explain that their child has gotten sick every month since 2 months of age. The boy had multiple upper respiratory infections and has been treated for pneumonia twice. He coughs frequently, and a trial of salbutamol has not helped much. The parents also mention that the child has bulky, irregular stools. The boy was started late on his vaccinations as his parents were in Asia on missionary work when he was born, but his vaccinations are now up to date. The patient's brother and sister are both healthy and have no medical concerns. The boy's delivery was unremarkable. A sweat chloride test is positive. Genetic testing shows the absence of the typical deletion in the implicated gene, but the gene length appears to be shortened by one base pair. Which mutation could account for this finding? (D) Nonsense (C) Missense (B) Insertion (E) Silent (A) Frameshift
Reason: The answer is likely (A) Frameshift because the case description includes positive findings from a sweat chloride test and an abnormal genetic result where the gene length is shortened by one base pair. A frameshift mutation occurs when there is an insertion or deletion of nucleotides that alters the reading frame of the gene, potentially explaining the symptoms of cystic fibrosis and the atypical genetic findings despite the absence of a typical deletion.

Question: A 6-year-old boy is brought in by his mother to his pediatrician for headache and nausea. His headaches began approximately 3 weeks ago and occur in the morning. Throughout the 3 weeks, his nausea has progressively worsened, and he had 2 episodes of emesis 1 day ago. On physical exam, cranial nerves are grossly intact, and his visual field is intact. The patient has a broad-based gait and difficulty with heel-to-toe walking, as well as head titubation. Fundoscopy demonstrates papilledema. A T1 and T2 MRI of the brain is demonstrated in Figures A and B, respectively. Which of the following is most likely the diagnosis? (D) Pilocytic astrocytoma (C) Medulloblastoma (E) Pinealoma (A) Craniopharyngioma (B) Ependymoma
Reason: The presentation of morning headaches, nausea, vomiting, and neurological signs such as a broad-based gait and head titubation, along with the examination findings of papilledema, suggests increased intracranial pressure. Medulloblastoma is a common brain tumor in children that often presents with similar symptoms due to its location in the posterior fossa, leading to blockage of cerebrospinal fluid flow and resultant hydrocephalus, which aligns with the clinical picture described.
Answer: (C) Medulloblastoma

Question: A 47-year-old man presents as a new patient at an outpatient clinic. He has never seen a physician before, but was motivated by his 40-year-old brother's recent heart attack and seeks to optimize his health. In particular, he read that uncontrolled atherosclerosis can lead to a heart attack. Which molecule is downregulated in response to the advent of atherosclerosis? (D) Interleukin 1 (E) Tumor necrosis factor (A) Serotonin (C) Nitric oxide (B) Thromboxane A2
Reason: In the context of atherosclerosis, the endothelium becomes dysfunctional, which leads to decreased production of nitric oxide (NO), a molecule that normally helps maintain vascular health by promoting vasodilation and inhibiting platelet aggregation. The reduction in nitric oxide is significant as it is linked to the progression of atherosclerosis and contributes to the overall failure of the vascular system to respond appropriately, increasing the risk of cardiovascular events such as heart attacks.
Answer: (C) Nitric oxide

Question: A 38-year-old man arrives at the emergency department with severe periumbilical, colicky pain and abdominal distention for the past 2 days. He is nauseated and reports vomiting light-green emesis 8 times since yesterday morning. He has not had a bowel movement or passed any gas for the past 3 days. He has a past medical history of ventral hernia repair 5 years ago. His heart rate is 110/min, respiratory rate is 24/min, temperature is 38.0°C (100.4°F), and blood pressure is 120/90 mm Hg. The abdomen is distended and mildly tender to deep palpation. Bowel sounds are high-pitched and tinkling. Which of the following is the most likely cause? (E) Viral gastroenteritis (A) Cholecystitis (C) Diverticulitis (D) Small bowel obstruction (B) Crohn's disease
Reason: The symptoms presented by the patient, including severe abdominal pain, distention, nausea, vomiting of light-green emesis, and the absence of bowel movements or gas for three days, are indicative of a small bowel obstruction. The history of prior ventral hernia repair could also suggest a mechanical cause for the obstruction, as adhesions from previous surgeries are a common complication that can lead to such an event.

Question: A 47-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with pain in her right knee. She states that the pain started last night and rapidly worsened, prompting her presentation for care. The patient has a past medical history of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. Her current medications include corticosteroids, infliximab, ibuprofen, and aspirin. The patient denies any recent trauma to the joint. Her temperature is 99.5°F (37.5°C), pulse is 112/min, blood pressure is 100/70 mmHg, respirations are 18/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. On physical exam, you note erythema and edema of the right knee. There is limited range of motion due to pain of the right knee.

Which of the following is the best initial step in management? (A) CT scan (D) Surgical drainage (E) Conservative therapy (C) Aspiration (B) Broad spectrum antibiotics
Reason: The patient's symptoms, including rapid onset of knee pain, swelling, erythema, and limited range of motion, suggest the possibility of a joint effusion or an infectious process like septic arthritis. Aspiration of the knee allows for both diagnostic analysis of the synovial fluid to identify infection or crystals and potential therapeutic relief of pressure and pain, making it the best initial management step in this scenario.
Answer: (C) Aspiration

Question: An 82-year-old woman presents with 2 months of foul-smelling, greasy diarrhea. She says that she also has felt very tired recently and has had some associated bloating and flatus. She denies any recent abdominal pain, nausea, melena, hematochezia, or vomiting. She also denies any history of recent travel and states that her home has city water. Which of the following tests would be most appropriate to initially work up the most likely diagnosis in this patient? (B) CT of the abdomen with oral contrast (E) Tissue transglutaminase antibody test (A) Fecal fat test (C) Stool O&P (D) Stool guaiac test
Reason: The patient's symptoms of foul-smelling, greasy diarrhea (steatorrhea), fatigue, and bloating suggest a malabsorption syndrome, potentially indicating an issue with fat absorption. The fecal fat test is the most appropriate initial test to assess for fat malabsorption, as it directly measures the fat content in the stool and can help confirm the suspected diagnosis.
Answer: (A) Fecal fat test

Question: A 24-year-old African American college student comes to the office for a scheduled visit. He has been healthy, although he reports occasional flank discomfort which comes and goes. He denies any fever, chills, dysuria, or polyuria in the past year. His vaccinations are up to date. His family history is unknown, as he was adopted. He smokes 1 pack of cigarettes every 3 days, drinks socially, and denies any current illicit drug use, although he endorses a history of injection drug use. He currently works as a waiter to afford his college tuition. His physical examination shows a young man with a lean build, normal heart sounds, clear breath sounds, bowel sounds within normal limits, and no lower extremity edema. You order a urinalysis which shows 8 red blood cells (RBCs) per high-power field (HPF). The test is repeated several weeks later and shows 6 RBCs/HPF. What is the most appropriate next step in management? (B) Intravenous (IV) pyelogram (C) 24-hour urine collection test (D) Repeat urinalysis in 6 months (E) Observation (A) Plain abdominal X-ray
Reason: The answer is (B) Intravenous (IV) pyelogram because the presence of persistent hematuria (red blood cells in urine) raises concern for an underlying renal or urologic pathology, such as a stone, tumor, or structural abnormality. An IV pyelogram is a useful imaging study that can provide more detailed information about the kidneys and urinary tract, helping to identify potential causes of the hematuria.

Question: Background and Methods:
Aldosterone is important in the pathophysiology of heart failure. In a double-blind study, we enrolled 1,663 patients who had NYHA class III or IV heart failure, a left ventricular ejection fraction of no more than 35%, and who were being treated with an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor, a loop diuretic, and in most cases digoxin. A total of 822 patients were randomly assigned to receive 25 mg of spironolactone daily and 841 to receive placebo. The primary endpoint was death from all causes.
Results:
The trial was discontinued early, after a mean follow-up period of 24 months, because an interim analysis determined that spironolactone was efficacious. There were 386 deaths in the placebo group (46%) and 284 in the spironolactone group (35%; relative risk of death, 0.70; 95% confidence interval, 0.60 to 0.82; P<0.001). This 30% reduction in the risk of death among patients in the spironolactone group was attributed to a lower risk of both death from progressive heart failure and sudden death from cardiac causes. The frequency of hospitalization for worsening heart failure was 35% lower in the spironolactone group than in the placebo group (relative risk of hospitalization, 0.65; 95% confidence interval, 0.54 to 0.77; P<0.001). In addition, patients who received spironolactone had a significant improvement in the symptoms of heart failure, as assessed on the basis of the New York Heart Association functional class (P<0.001). Gynecomastia or breast pain was reported in 10% of men who were treated with spironolactone, as compared with 1 percent of men in the placebo group (P<0.001). The incidence of serious hyperkalemia was minimal in both groups of patients.
To which of the following patients are the results of this clinical trial applicable? (E) A 78-year-old male with NYHA class II heart failure and LVEF 36% (C) A 56-year-old male with NYHA class III heart failure with an LVEF of 32%, current taking lisinopril, furosemide, and digoxin (A) An 82-year-old female with NYHA class II heart failure with an LVEF of 22%, taking lisinopril, furosemide, and digoxin (B) A 65-year-old male with newly diagnosed NYHA class IV heart failure and a LVEF of 21%, about to begin medical therapy (D) An 86-year-old female recently found to have an LVEF of 34%, currently taking furosemide and carvedilol
Reason: The answer is (C) A 56-year-old male with NYHA class III heart failure with an LVEF of 32%, currently taking lisinopril, furosemide, and digoxin because the trial specifically enrolled patients with NYHA class III or IV heart failure and a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of no more than 35%. This patient's profile aligns with the inclusion criteria of the study, making the trial results applicable to their management.

Question: A 25-year old man comes to the physician because of fatigue over the past 6 months. He has been to the emergency room several times over the past 3 years for recurrent shoulder and patella dislocations. Physical examination shows abnormal joint hypermobility and skin hyperextensibility. A high-frequency mid-systolic click is heard on auscultation. Which of the following is most likely to result in an earlier onset of this patient’s auscultation finding? (A) Hand grip (D) Valsalva release phase (E) Leaning forward (C) Rapid squatting (B) Abrupt standing
Reason: The answer is (B) Abrupt standing because this maneuver decreases venous return and can lead to a decrease in left ventricular filling, which may result in a more pronounced mid-systolic click associated with mitral valve prolapse (MVP). The click is thought to arise from the sudden tension on the chordae tendineae as the mitral valve leaflets are pulled taut during rapid changes in intrathoracic pressures, making the click more audible during activities that alter preload, such as standing up abruptly.
Answer: (B) Abrupt standing

Question: A 71-year-old woman with a past medical history of type 2 diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertension was admitted to the hospital 8 hours ago with substernal chest pain for management of acute non-ST-elevated myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The ECG findings noted by ST-depressions and T-wave inversions on anterolateral leads, which is also accompanied by elevated cardiac enzymes. Upon diagnosis, management with inhaled oxygen therapy, beta-blockers and aspirin, and low-molecular-weight heparin therapy were initiated, and she was placed on bed rest with continuous electrocardiographic monitoring. Since admission, she required 2 doses of sublingual nitric oxide for recurrent angina, and the repeat troponin levels continued to rise. Given her risk factors, plans were made for early coronary angiography. The telemetry nurse calls the on-call physician because of her concern with the patient’s mild confusion and increasing need for supplemental oxygen. At bedside evaluation, The vital signs include: heart rate 122/min, blood pressure 89/40 mm Hg, and the pulse oximetry is 91% on 6L of oxygen by nasal cannula. The telemetry and a repeat ECG show sinus tachycardia. She is breathing rapidly, appears confused, and complains of shortness of breath. On physical exam, the skin is cool and clammy and appears pale and dull. She has diffuse bilateral pulmonary crackles, and an S3 gallop is noted on chest auscultation with no new murmurs. She has jugular venous distention to the jaw-line, rapid and faint radial pulses, and 1+ dependent edema. She is immediately transferred to the intensive care unit for respiratory support and precautions for airway security. The bedside sonography shows abnormal hypodynamic anterior wall movement and an ejection fraction of 20%, but no evidence of mitral regurgitation or ventricular shunt. The chest X-ray demonstrates cephalization of pulmonary veins and pulmonary edema. What is the most appropriate next step in the stabilization of this patient? (D) Obtain blood cultures and start preliminary broad-spectrum antibiotics (B) Initiate dopamine therapy and diuresis (A) Insert two large-bore intravenous catheters and start rapid fluid resuscitation (C) Start intravenous fluids and epinephrine therapy (E) Intubate the patient and perform an emergency cardiocentesis
Reason: The rationale for initiating dopamine therapy and diuresis in this patient is that she presents with signs and symptoms indicative of acute heart failure and cardiogenic shock, including hypotension, altered mental status, and pulmonary edema. Dopamine can help improve cardiac output and renal perfusion, while diuretics will assist in reducing the volume overload and symptomatic pulmonary congestion.

Question: A 73-year-old woman is brought to the physician by her son because of increasing forgetfulness over the past 2 years. Initially, she used to misplace keys and forget her dog's name or her phone number. Now, she often forgets about what she has seen on television or read about the day before. She used to go for a walk every morning but stopped one month ago after she became lost on her way back home. Her son has prevented her from cooking because she has had episodes of leaving the gas stove oven on after making a meal. She becomes agitated when asked questions directly but is unconcerned when her son reports her history and says he is overprotective of her. She has hypertension, coronary artery disease, and hypercholesterolemia. Current medications include aspirin, enalapril, carvedilol, and atorvastatin. She is alert and oriented to place and person but not to time. Vital signs are within normal limits. Short- and long-term memory deficits are present. Her speech rhythm is normal but is frequently interrupted as she thinks of words to frame her sentences. She makes multiple errors while performing serial sevens. Her clock drawing is impaired and she draws 14 numbers. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? (B) Lewy-body dementia (C) Frontotemporal dementia (A) Normal pressure hydrocephalus (E) Alzheimer disease (D) Creutzfeld-Jakob disease
Reason: The most likely diagnosis for this patient is Alzheimer's disease given the progressive nature of her memory deficits, particularly the increasing forgetfulness affecting both short- and long-term memory, as well as difficulty with word retrieval and tasks like serial sevens. The patient’s inability to recognize the passage of time and her loss of previous interests, such as taking walks, further align with the cognitive decline typically seen in Alzheimer's disease.

Question: A 55-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician with diarrhea. She states that it has persisted for the past several weeks and has not been improving. She also endorses episodes of feeling particularly flushed in the face. Her temperature is 99°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 125/63 mmHg, pulse is 100/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 97% on room air. Physical exam is notable for wheezing on pulmonary exam. The patient is discharged with medications for her symptoms. She returns 2 weeks later with symptoms of diarrhea, dry skin, a non-specific rash, and a notable decline in her memory. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient’s most recent presentation? (D) Niacin deficiency (E) Vitamin B12 deficiency (C) Increased vasoactive intestinal peptide levels (B) Increased serotonin levels (A) Increased catecholamine levels
Reason: The patient's symptoms of diarrhea, dry skin, and a non-specific rash, along with cognitive decline, are consistent with Pellagra, which is caused by niacin deficiency. Niacin is vital for various metabolic processes, and its deficiency can lead to the classic triad of diarrhea, dermatitis, and dementia, aligning with the patient's recent presentation and history of gastrointestinal issues.

Question: A 2-year-old boy is being evaluated for an autosomal-recessive condition that produces valine instead of glutamine in the β-globin gene. On further examination, the patient’s X-ray showed a crew cut appearance of the skull. Which of the following statements about his condition is false? (B) Target cells are seen in blood smear (C) An individual needs 2 defective β-globin genes to have the sickle cell trait (D) Extravascular hemolysis (E) Salmonella paratyphi can cause osteomyelitis in these patients (A) Complications are due to vaso-occlusion
Reason: The statement is false because having sickle cell trait means that an individual has one defective β-globin gene and one normal β-globin gene, whereas having sickle cell disease requires two copies of the defective gene. This means that individuals with sickle cell trait typically do not have the full disease symptoms, while those with sickle cell disease, who have two defective genes, experience significant health complications including vaso-occlusive episodes.
Answer: (C) An individual needs 2 defective β-globin genes to have the sickle cell trait

Question: A 24-year-old woman at 6 weeks gestation seeks evaluation at a local walk-in clinic because she has noticed a clear, sticky discharge from her right nipple for the past 1 week. The discharge leaves a pink stain on her bra. She does not have pain in her breasts and denies changes in skin color or nipple shape. The past medical history is significant for a major depressive disorder, for which she takes fluoxetine. The family history is negative for breast, endometrial, and ovarian cancers. The physical examination is unremarkable. There are no palpable masses or tenderness on breast exam and no skin discoloration or ulcers. The breasts are symmetric. The nipple discharge on the right side is a pink secretion that is sticky. There are no secretions on the left. The axillary lymph nodes are normal. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? (D) Breast cancer (C) Papilloma (A) Mastitis (B) Drug-induced (E) Lactation
Reason: The symptoms described—clear, sticky discharge from the nipple that leaves a pink stain—are indicative of a papilloma, which is a benign tumor within the ducts of the breast. The lack of pain, unremarkable physical examination without palpable masses or skin changes, and the solitary nature of the discharge all point towards a localized ductal condition rather than breast cancer, mastitis, drug-induced effects, or a lactation-related issue.

1. **Understanding the Anatomy**: The L3 vertebral level is significant in relation to the abdominal vasculature. At this level, several important structures are in proximity, including branches of the abdominal aorta and the inferior vena cava.

2. **Vascular Structures at L3**:
   - The **inferior vena cava (IVC)** runs along the right side of the vertebral column and is located anterior to the vertebrae. A penetrating wound at L3 could potentially injure the IVC, causing significant hemorrhage.
   - The **renal arteries** branch off the abdominal aorta above L3, so they would not be affected by a wound at this level.
   - The **portal vein** is located more anteriorly and inferiorly in the abdomen and is not directly at the L3 level.
   - The **internal iliac artery and vein** are located more distally and would typically be affected by injuries lower in the pelvis.

3. **Penetrating Injury Consideration**: Given that the bullet is assumed to remain at the level of L3, the most likely major vascular structure that could be directly injured by a penetrating injury at this level is the inferior vena cava.

Based on this reasoning, the answer is: (A) Inferior vena cava.
Path 2: Let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. **Understanding the Anatomy:** The level of L3 corresponds to a significant area in the abdominal and pelvic region where various major blood vessels are located. At this level, both the abdominal aorta and inferior vena cava are present.

2. **Identifying Relevant Structures:**
   - **Aorta branches:** The renal arteries branch off the abdominal aorta at L1-L2, so they are not directly injured at L3.
   - **Inferior vena cava (IVC):** The IVC runs along the right side of the spine and is at risk with penetrating injuries at the level of L3.
   - **Internal iliac artery and vein:** These vessels branch off the common iliac arteries and veins at a lower level (around L5) but could still be involved depending on the trajectory of the bullet.
   - **Portal vein:** This structure is generally located more anteriorly and would be less likely to be injured directly by a bullet at L3.

3. **Shock Assessment:** The victim is in shock, which could result from significant vascular injury and hemorrhage. The IVC and major pelvic vessels are critical in this context as they could lead to rapid blood loss.

Given the details above, the most likely injured vascular structure in a gunshot wound at the level of L3 is the **Inferior vena cava (A)**, as it is directly in the path of a penetrating injury at that level.

**Final Answer: (A) Inferior vena cava**
Path 3: Let's analyze the options step by step to determine which vascular structure might have been injured given a penetrating wound at the level of L3.

1. **Renal artery (D)**: The renal arteries branch off from the abdominal aorta at the level of L1-L2, so a wound at L3 would not likely injure this structure.

2. **Portal vein (E)**: The portal vein is located more anteriorly and is typically not affected by a wound at L3, as it is formed by the union of the superior mesenteric vein and the splenic vein.

3. **Internal iliac vein (C)**: The internal iliac veins are located at the pelvic level, and while they are in the vicinity of L3, they are primarily located below this level.

4. **Internal iliac artery (B)**: Similar to the internal iliac vein, the internal iliac artery branches off at the level of the sacrum and is not typically associated with an L3 level wound.

5. **Inferior vena cava (A)**: The inferior vena cava runs along the right side of the vertebral column and typically lies at the L3 level. A penetrating wound at this level is likely to injure the inferior vena cava.

Based on this analysis, the most likely vascular structure that might have been injured by a penetrating wound at the level of L3 is:

**Answer: (A) Inferior vena cava**
Path 4: To determine which vascular structure might have been injured in a gunshot victim with a penetrating wound at the level of L3, let's analyze the anatomy and the options provided.

1. **Inferior Vena Cava (IVC)** - The IVC runs along the right side of the vertebral column and is located at the level of L3. A penetrating wound at this level could potentially injure the IVC.

2. **Renal Artery** - The renal arteries branch off the aorta at approximately the level of L1-L2, so they are less likely to be directly affected by a wound at L3.

3. **Internal Iliac Artery** - The internal iliac arteries branch off from the common iliac arteries at the level of L4, which is lower than L3.

4. **Internal Iliac Vein** - Similar to the internal iliac artery, the internal iliac vein also branches off at around L4.

5. **Portal Vein** - The portal vein is located in the abdomen but is not directly related to the level of L3 and is more involved with the liver and gastrointestinal tract.

Based on this anatomical consideration, the structure most likely to be injured by a gunshot wound at the level of L3 is the **Inferior Vena Cava**.

Therefore, the answer is: **(A) Inferior vena cava**.
Path 5: To determine which vascular structure might have been injured in a gunshot victim with a penetrating wound at the level of L3, let's consider the anatomy of the abdominal vasculature.

1. **Inferior Vena Cava (IVC)**: The IVC runs along the right side of the vertebral column and would be at the level of L3; thus, it is a potential structure that could be injured.

2. **Renal Artery**: The renal arteries arise from the abdominal aorta at the level of L1-L2, so they are not at the L3 level.

3. **Internal Iliac Artery**: The internal iliac arteries branch off from the common iliac arteries at the level of L4, making them less likely to be directly affected by a wound at L3.

4. **Internal Iliac Vein**: Similar to the internal iliac artery, the internal iliac veins also branch off at a level lower than L3.

5. **Portal Vein**: The portal vein is formed by the union of the splenic vein and the superior mesenteric vein and is located anterior to the vertebral column, but it is not typically injured by a wound at L3.

Given this analysis, the most likely vascular structure that could have been injured by a gunshot wound at the level of L3 is the **Inferior Vena Cava**.

Answer: (A) Inferior vena cava
Path 6: To determine which vascular structure might have been injured in a gunshot victim with a penetrating wound at the level of L3, we need to consider the anatomy of the major vessels in the retroperitoneal space at this level.

1. **Inferior Vena Cava (IVC)**: The IVC runs alongside the aorta in the retroperitoneal space and is located on the right side of the body. It is positioned at about the level of L2-L3 but can be affected by a wound at the L3 level.

2. **Renal Arteries**: The renal arteries branch off from the abdominal aorta at the level of L1-L2. They are located higher than L3, so they are less likely to be injured by a wound at L3.

3. **Internal Iliac Artery and Vein**: The internal iliac arteries and veins branch from the common iliac arteries and veins at the level of L4. This means they are also positioned lower than L3 and would not typically be injured by a wound at this level.

4. **Portal Vein**: The portal vein is located anterior to the IVC and is more superior and medial, branching off from the splenic and superior mesenteric veins. It is not likely to be affected by a wound at L3.

Given this anatomy, the most likely vascular structure to be injured by a penetrating wound at the level of L3 is the **Inferior Vena Cava (IVC)**.

So the answer is:
**(A) Inferior vena cava**
Path 7: Let's analyze the question step by step:

1. The gunshot victim has a penetrating wound at the level of L3. This is important for identifying which vascular structures are located around this level in the body.

2. At the level of L3, the following vascular structures are typically found:
   - **Inferior vena cava (IVC)**: This is located anterior to the vertebral column and runs along the right side of the aorta.
   - **Renal arteries**: These branch off the aorta just above the L3 level, supplying blood to the kidneys.
   - **Internal iliac arteries and veins**: These arise at the level of L5, but their branches may be affected by injuries at L3.
   - **Portal vein**: This is located more anteriorly and is not usually at risk from wounds at L3.

3. Considering the options provided:
   - (A) Inferior vena cava: This structure is at risk for injury at the L3 level since it runs vertically along the right side.
   - (B) Internal iliac artery: These arise at a lower level (L5-S1).
   - (C) Internal iliac vein: Similar to the internal iliac artery, this structure is also lower and may not be directly injured at L3.
   - (D) Renal artery: This structure arises above L3, from the aorta, and is less likely to be directly injured.
   - (E) Portal vein: This is located more anteriorly and is not typically associated with injuries at the L3 level.

Based on this analysis, the most likely vascular structure that might have been injured by a gunshot wound at the level of L3 is the **inferior vena cava**.

Answer: (A) Inferior vena cava
Path 8: To determine which vascular structure might have been injured in a gunshot victim with a penetrating wound at the level of L3, we need to consider the anatomical structures located at that level.

1. **Inferior Vena Cava (IVC)**: The IVC runs just to the right of the midline and can be injured with a penetrating wound at L3.

2. **Renal Artery**: The renal arteries branch off from the aorta just above the L3 level, so they are less likely to be injured from a direct wound at the L3 level.

3. **Internal Iliac Artery and Vein**: These structures branch off at a lower level (around the S1 level) and are less likely to be directly affected by a wound at L3.

4. **Portal Vein**: The portal vein is located higher in the abdomen and would not be injured at the L3 level.

Given this anatomical context, the most likely structure to be injured at the level of L3 in a penetrating gunshot wound is the **Inferior Vena Cava**.

**Answer: (A) Inferior vena cava**
Path 9: Let's analyze the question step by step:

1. **Understanding the anatomy**: The L3 vertebra is located in the lumbar region of the spine. At this level, there are several important vascular structures passing through the abdomen and pelvis.

2. **Identifying vascular structures near L3**:
   - The **inferior vena cava (IVC)** runs along the right side of the vertebral column and collects blood from the lower body.
   - The **renal arteries** branch off from the aorta and supply the kidneys. The left renal artery is generally more posterior than the right.
   - The **internal iliac arteries** (and veins) are branches of the common iliac arteries (and veins) that supply the pelvis.
   - The **portal vein** carries blood from the gastrointestinal tract to the liver and is located anteriorly in the abdomen.

3. **Assessing potential injury**: A gunshot wound at the level of L3 can potentially injure structures posterior to the peritoneum, which would include the IVC and possibly the internal iliac arteries and veins.

4. **Considering the most likely injured structure**:
   - The **inferior vena cava (IVC)** is the largest vein in the body that runs in the lumbar region, and a penetrating wound at L3 could realistically damage it, leading to significant hemorrhage and shock.
   - While the internal iliac artery and vein are also possible candidates, they are further down in the pelvic cavity and may not be directly affected by a wound at L3.

Based on this reasoning, the most likely vascular structure that might have been injured in this scenario is:

**Answer: (A) Inferior vena cava**
Path 10: To determine which vascular structure might have been injured by a gunshot wound at the level of L3, let's analyze the anatomy:

1. **L3 Vertebral Level**: The L3 vertebra is located in the lumbar region of the spine. At this level, several important vascular structures are present.

2. **Vascular Structures at L3**:
   - The **inferior vena cava (IVC)** runs anterior to the vertebral column and can be injured with penetrating trauma.
   - The **renal arteries** originate from the abdominal aorta just above the L3 level.
   - The **internal iliac arteries and veins** branch off from the common iliac arteries and veins, which are located more inferiorly than L3.

3. **Potential Injury**:
   - Given a penetrating wound at L3, the **inferior vena cava (IVC)** is a major vessel that could be directly injured due to its location and size.
   - The **internal iliac artery** and **internal iliac vein** are also significant vessels, but they are generally at a lower level than L3.

Based on the anatomy and the location of the penetrating wound, the most likely vascular structure that might have been injured is the inferior vena cava.

Answer: (A) Inferior vena cava

Question: A 25-year-old woman comes to the physician because of irregular menstrual bleeding. Menarche occurred at the age of 12 years and menses have occurred at 45 to 90-day intervals. Her last menstrual period was 8 weeks ago. She is not sexually active. Serum studies show:
Fasting glucose 178 mg/dL
Fasting insulin 29 mcIU/mL (N = 2.6–24.9 mcIU/mL)
Luteinizing hormone 160 mIU/mL
Total testosterone 3.2 ng/dL (N = 0.06–1.06 ng/dL)
Serum electrolytes are within the reference range. Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following findings?" (C) Enlarged ovaries on transvaginal ultrasound (E) Elevated serum TSH level (B) Adrenal tumor on abdominal MRI (D) Intrasellar mass on cranial contrast MRI (A) Elevated serum beta-HCG level
Reason: The irregular menstrual bleeding, elevated fasting glucose and insulin levels, along with elevated luteinizing hormone (LH) and total testosterone, suggest a diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). In PCOS, patients often have enlarged ovaries with multiple follicles visible on transvaginal ultrasound, making option (C) the most likely finding upon further evaluation.
Answer: (C) Enlarged ovaries on transvaginal ultrasound

Question: A 38-year-old woman comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. She was diagnosed with immune thrombocytopenic purpura at the age of 37 years and has been treated with glucocorticoids and intravenous immune globulin. She has visited the emergency department 3 times in the past 4 months for nose bleeds, which required cauterization. Her platelet counts on her previous visits were 18,320/mm3, 17,500/mm3, and 19,100/mm3. Current medications include dexamethasone and a multivitamin. She has no children. Her immunizations are up-to-date. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows petechiae on the bilateral lower extremities. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. The abdomen is soft and nontender; there is no organomegaly. Her hemoglobin concentration is 13.3 g/dL, leukocyte count is 8,100/mm3, and platelet count is 13,000/mm3. Her blood type is A negative. Serology for hepatitis C and HIV is negative. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? (A) Romiplostim therapy (B) Rituximab therapy (D) Observation and follow-up (E) Schedule splenectomy (C) Danazol therapy
Reason: A splenectomy is indicated in this case because the patient has severe immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) with persistent thrombocytopenia and significant bleeding episodes despite receiving treatment with glucocorticoids and intravenous immune globulin. Splenectomy is considered for patients with ITP who do not respond adequately to medical therapy, as the spleen is a primary site for platelet destruction in autoimmune conditions like ITP.

Question: A scientist is studying the mechanisms by which bacteria become resistant to antibiotics. She begins by obtaining a culture of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis and conducts replicate plating experiments. In these experiments, colonies are inoculated onto a membrane and smeared on 2 separate plates, 1 containing vancomycin and the other with no antibiotics. She finds that all of the bacterial colonies are vancomycin resistant because they grow on both plates. She then maintains the bacteria in liquid culture without vancomycin while she performs her other studies. Fifteen generations of bacteria later, she conducts replicate plating experiments again and finds that 20% of the colonies are now sensitive to vancomycin. Which of the following mechanisms is the most likely explanation for why these colonies have become vancomycin sensitive? (B) Plasmid loss (D) Loss of function mutation (C) Point mutation (A) Gain of function mutation (E) Viral infection
Reason: The scientific rationale for choosing plasmid loss as the explanation for the vancomycin sensitivity in 20% of the colonies after 15 generations is based on the understanding that antibiotic resistance can often be encoded by plasmids. In the initial culture, the presence of a plasmid carrying the resistance gene would enable all bacterial colonies to grow in the presence of vancomycin. If, over time, some bacteria lose that plasmid (through mechanisms like segregation during cell division), they would no longer have the resistance gene, resulting in vancomycin sensitivity. This is consistent with the observed change in resistance after multiple generations in liquid culture without antibiotic pressure.
Answer: (B) Plasmid loss

Question: A 62-year-old woman presents to her physician because she has been feeling increasingly fatigued over the last several months. In addition, she says that she has woken up at night several times and found herself completely covered in sweat. Finally, she says that she has lost 20 pounds despite no changes in her daily routine. On presentation, her temperature is 101.0°F (38.3°C), blood pressure is 134/83 mmHg, pulse is 71/min, and respirations are 19/min. Physical exam reveals a number of enlarged lymph nodes. Based on these findings, she is given a lab test revealing an abnormally high concentration of a protein arranged in a pentameric complex on serum electrophoresis. Which of the following is most strongly associated with the cause of this patient's symptoms? (C) Jaw lesion (A) Bone marrow fibrosis (D) Retinal hemorrhage (E) Sjogren syndrome (B) Calcitriol secretion
Reason: The reasoning for selecting retinal hemorrhage as the most likely associated cause of this patient's symptoms is that she displays signs consistent with a hematological malignancy, such as multiple myeloma, indicated by her weight loss, night sweats, fever, and lymphadenopathy, coupled with the lab finding of a pentameric protein. Retinal hemorrhages can occur in patients with multiple myeloma due to the associated complications of hyperviscosity syndrome or infiltration of malignant cells into ocular structures, making it a potential complication of the underlying condition suggested by her symptoms.
Answer: (D) Retinal hemorrhage

Question: A 16-year-old boy is brought to the physician for a follow-up examination. He has a 6-year history of type 1 diabetes mellitus and his only medication is insulin. Seven months ago, he was treated for an episode of diabetic ketoacidosis. He has previously been compliant with his diet and insulin regimen. He wants to join the high school soccer team. Vital signs are within normal limits. His hemoglobin A1C is 6.3%. Which of the following is the most appropriate recommendation at this time? (A) Advise against physical activity (B) Lower insulin dosage on days of exercise (C) Switch from insulin to metformin (E) Limit activity to 20 minutes per day (D) Increase insulin dosage on days of exercise
Reason: The recommendation to lower insulin dosage on days of exercise is appropriate because physical activity can increase insulin sensitivity, thus requiring a lower dose of insulin to prevent hypoglycemia. Additionally, for a young individual with well-controlled type 1 diabetes mellitus, accommodating for exercise through insulin adjustments is crucial in maintaining stable blood glucose levels while promoting an active lifestyle without the risk of adverse effects.
Answer: (B) Lower insulin dosage on days of exercise

Question: A 2400-g (5.29-lb) male newborn is delivered at term to a 38-year-old woman. The initial examination shows that the child is at the 5th percentile for head circumference and 10th percentile for weight and length. He has a sloping forehead, a flat nasal bridge, increased interocular distance, low-set ears, and a protruding tongue. An examination of the peripheries reveals a single palmar crease and an increased gap between the first and second toe. Ocular examination reveals small white and brown spots in the periphery of both irises. The abdomen is distended. An x-ray of the abdomen shows two large air-filled spaces in the upper quadrant. This child's condition is most likely associated with which of the following cardiac anomalies? (E) Transposition of the great arteries
" (C) Tetralogy of Fallot (A) Atrioventricular septal defect (D) Pulmonary valve stenosis (B) Ventricular septal defect
Reason: The child's clinical features, including facial dysmorphism and gastrointestinal issues, suggest a condition that is often associated with genetic syndromes. Atrioventricular septal defects are commonly seen in conditions like Down syndrome (Trisomy 21), which can present with similar characteristics as described in the question. Thus, the correct answer reflects the association found in such congenital conditions.

Question: A 61-year-old woman presents to the emergency room with left leg pain and swelling. She recently returned to the United States from a trip to India. Her past medical history is notable for osteoarthritis in both hips, lumbar spinal stenosis, and hypertension. She takes lisinopril. Her temperature is 99°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 140/85 mmHg, pulse is 110/min, and respirations are 24/min. On examination, her left calf is larger than her right calf. A lower extremity ultrasound demonstrates a deep venous thrombosis in the left femoral vein. Results from a complete blood count are within normal limits. She is discharged on low-molecular weight heparin. Seven days later, she presents to the emergency room with a dark erythematous skin lesion on her left thigh and worsening left leg swelling. A lower extremity ultrasound demonstrates a persistent deep venous thrombosis in the left femoral vein as well as a new deep venous thrombosis in the left popliteal vein. Results of a complete blood count are shown below:

Hemoglobin: 13.1 g/dL
Hematocrit: 38%
Leukocyte count: 9,600/mm^3 with normal differential
Platelet count: 74,000/mm^3

A medication with which of the following mechanisms of action is most appropriate to initiate in this patient after stopping the heparin drip? (A) Adenosine-diphosphate (ADP) receptor antagonist (E) Vitamin K epoxide reductase inhibitor (D) Direct thrombin inhibitor (B) Anti-thrombin III activator (C) Cyclooxygenase inhibitor
Reason: The patient's presentation is consistent with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), evidenced by the new thrombosis and significantly low platelet count following the administration of low-molecular weight heparin. In cases of HIT, a direct thrombin inhibitor is preferred as it directly inhibits thrombin, making it appropriate for managing thrombotic complications in patients with a history of heparin use.
Answer: (D) Direct thrombin inhibitor

Question: A 74-year-old woman is brought by ambulance to the emergency department and presents with a complaint of excruciating chest pain that started about 45 minutes ago. The patient was sitting in the garden when she 1st noticed the pain in the upper abdomen. The pain has persisted and now localizes underneath of the sternum and the left shoulder. Milk of magnesia and aspirin were tried with no relief. The patient had previous episodes of chest pain that were of lesser intensity and rarely lasted more than 10 minutes. She is diabetic and has been managed for hypertension and rheumatoid arthritis in the past. On examination, the patient is breathless and sweating profusely. The vital signs include blood pressure 140/90 mm Hg and heart rate 118/min. The electrocardiogram (ECG) shows Q waves in leads V2 and V3 and raised ST segments in leads V2, V3, V4, and V5. Laboratory studies (including cardiac enzymes at 6 hours after admission show:
Hematocrit 45%
Troponin T 1.5 ng/mL
Troponin I 0.28 ng/mL
Creatine kinase (CK)-MB 0.25 ng/mL
The patient is admitted and started on analgesia and reperfusion therapy. She shows initial signs of recovery until the 6th day of hospitalization when she starts vomiting and complaining of dizziness. Physical examination findings at this time included heart rate 110/min, temperature 37.7°C (99.9°F), blood pressure 90/60 mm Hg. Jugular venous pressure is 8 cm. A harsh pansystolic murmur is present at the left lower sternal border. ECG shows sinus tachycardia and ST-segment elevation with terminal negative T waves. Laboratory studies show:

Question: A 7-day-old male infant presents to the pediatrician for weight loss. There is no history of excessive crying, irritability, lethargy, or feeding difficulty. The parents deny any history of fast breathing, bluish discoloration of lips/nails, fever, vomiting, diarrhea, or seizures. He was born at full term by vaginal delivery without any perinatal complications and his birth weight was 3.6 kg (8 lb). Since birth he has been exclusively breastfed and passes urine six to eight times a day. His physical examination, including vital signs, is completely normal. His weight is 3.3 kg (7.3 lb); length and head circumference are normal for his age and sex. Which of the following is the next best step in the management of the infant? (D) Supplementation of breastfeeding with a appropriate infant formula (B) Emphasize the need to clothe the infant warmly to prevent hypothermia (C) Evaluation of the mother for malnutrition (E) Admission of the infant in the NICU to treat with empiric intravenous antibiotics (A) Reassurance of parents
Reason: The infant presents with a normal physical examination and is passing an adequate number of wet diapers, which suggests that he is receiving sufficient hydration. Furthermore, a modest weight loss of approximately 8.3% from birth weight in a breastfed infant during the first week of life can be normal, especially considering that some weight loss is expected due to fluid loss after birth. Therefore, reassurance of the parents is the appropriate next step, as many infants regain their birth weight by 10 to 14 days of life without intervention.
Answer: (A) Reassurance of parents

Question: A 78-year-old woman presents with difficulty swallowing and retrosternal chest pain for the past couple of weeks. She says the pain radiates to the epigastric region and increases whenever she eats or drinks anything. She says the pain is not aggravated by exertion, and she denies any shortness of breath, nausea or vomiting, cough, sore throat, weight loss, or melena. She also denies any similar symptoms in the past. Past medical history is significant for hypertension, osteoporosis, stress incontinence, and a cataract in the left eye for which she underwent surgery 2 years ago. She is currently taking rosuvastatin, enalapril, risedronate, and oxybutynin. The patient denies any smoking history but says she consumes alcohol occasionally. The vital signs include pulse 74 /min, respiratory rate 14/min, and blood pressure 140/86 mm Hg. Abdominal examination reveals moderate tenderness to palpation over the epigastric region. The remainder of the physical examination is unremarkable. An electrocardiogram (ECG) is performed and shows mild left axis deviation. Which of the following is the next best step in the management of this patient? (B) Start her on ranitidine (C) Start esomeprazole, temporarily stop risedronate (A) Refer her for an upper GI endoscopy (E) Start esomeprazole and increase enalapril dose. (D) Start triple therapy with esomeprazole, metronidazole, and clarithromycin
Reason: The patient's symptoms of difficulty swallowing and retrosternal chest pain, especially worsening with eating or drinking, raise concerns for possible esophagitis or a peptic ulcer, particularly given her use of medications like risedronate, which can irritate the esophagus. Initiating esomeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, would help manage potential acid-related pathology, and temporarily stopping risedronate would prevent further esophageal irritation during the evaluation and management process.
Answer: (C) Start esomeprazole, temporarily stop risedronate

Question: A 21-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with complaints of intermittent bouts of lower abdominal and pelvic pain over the last week. The pain is primarily localized to the right side and is non-radiating. The patient is not sexually active at this time and is not currently under any medication. At the hospital, her vitals are normal. A pelvic examination reveals a tender palpable mass on the right adnexal structure. A pelvic CT scan reveals a 7-cm solid adnexal mass that was surgically removed with the ovary. Histological evaluation indicates sheets of uniform cells resembling a 'fried egg', consistent with dysgerminoma. Which of the following tumor markers is most likely elevated with this type of tumor? (C) Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) (B) Beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) (E) Cancer antigen 125 (CA-125) (D) Inhibin A (A) Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)
Reason: Dysgerminomas are a type of germ cell tumor that often produce elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) as a tumor marker. This is consistent with the tumor's origin and histological characteristics, as LDH can indicate cellular turnover and tissue damage associated with these tumors.

Question: A 43-year-old woman presents to her primary care provider for follow-up of her glucose levels. At her last visit 3 months ago, her fasting serum glucose was 128 mg/dl. At that time, she was instructed to follow a weight loss regimen consisting of diet and exercise. Her family history is notable for a myocardial infarction in her father and type II diabetes mellitus in her mother. She does not smoke and drinks 2-3 glasses of wine per week. Her temperature is 99°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 131/78 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, and respirations are 17/min. Her BMI is 31 kg/m^2. On exam, she is well-appearing and appropriately interactive. Today, despite attempting to make the appropriate lifestyle changes, a repeat fasting serum glucose is 133 mg/dl. The patient is prescribed the first-line oral pharmacologic agent for her condition. Which of the following is the correct mechanism of action of this medication? (E) Inhibition of the sodium-glucose cotransporter (C) Inhibition of alpha-glucosidase in the intestinal brush border (D) Inhibition of hepatic gluconeogenesis (B) Closure of potassium channels in pancreatic beta cells (A) Activation of peroxisome proliferator-activating receptors
Reason: The patient's elevated fasting serum glucose levels indicate she is likely suffering from type 2 diabetes mellitus, and the first-line pharmacologic treatment for this condition is often metformin. Metformin works primarily by inhibiting hepatic gluconeogenesis, which decreases glucose production in the liver, thereby lowering blood glucose levels.
Answer: (D) Inhibition of hepatic gluconeogenesis

Question: A researcher is investigating the relationship between inflammatory mediators and omega-3 fatty acids, namely docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), in post-MI patients. IL-1ß is an important pro-inflammatory cytokine involved in fibrosis and arrhythmias in the post-MI period. Research indicates that it causes loss of function in the gap junction connexin 43 (Cx43), resulting in an arrhythmogenic state. They perform an experiment investigating the cardioprotective effect of DHA on patients after a recent MI. Their results are shown in a Western blot analysis. Which of the following is the most accurate conclusion from these results? (C) Fatty acids with 3 cis-double bonds provide minimal benefits against arrhythmias after myocardial infarctions. (D) Fatty acids with double bonds in the 3rd position adjacent to the carboxy-terminus provide minimal benefits against arrhythmias after myocardial infarctions. (B) Fatty acids with double bonds in the 3rd position adjacent to the terminal carbon are cardioprotective against the effects of IL-1β in post-MI cells. (A) Fatty acids with double bonds in the 3rd position adjacent to the carboxy-terminus are cardioprotective against the effects of IL-1β in post-MI cells. (E) Fatty acids with double bonds in the 3rd position adjacent to the terminal carbon provide minimal benefits against arrhythmias after myocardial infarctions.
Reason: The most accurate conclusion from the research results is (B) fatty acids with double bonds in the 3rd position adjacent to the terminal carbon are cardioprotective against the effects of IL-1β in post-MI cells. This is supported by the understanding that omega-3 fatty acids, such as DHA and EPA, possess anti-inflammatory properties and have been shown to counteract some of the pro-arrhythmic effects of IL-1β, contributing to improved cardiac health after myocardial infarction.
Answer: (B) Fatty acids with double bonds in the 3rd position adjacent to the terminal carbon are cardioprotective against the effects of IL-1β in post-MI cells.

Question: A 31-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 5-day history of fever, chills, and dyspnea. His temperature is 38.9°C (102°F) and pulse is 90/min. Cardiac examination shows a murmur. In addition to other measures, cardiac catheterization is performed. A graph showing the results of the catheterization is shown. This patient most likely has which of the following valvular heart defects? (E) Aortic stenosis
" (D) Aortic regurgitation (C) Pulmonary regurgitation (B) Mitral regurgitation (A) Mitral stenosis
Reason: The answer is (D) Aortic regurgitation, primarily because the patient's symptoms of fever, chills, and dyspnea, along with the presence of a cardiac murmur, suggest an infectious process such as endocarditis. This condition often affects the aortic valve, leading to regurgitation due to valve damage, which aligns with the clinical presentation. Additional evidence from catheterization results would help confirm the presence of aortic regurgitation, characterized by specific hemodynamic patterns shown in the graph.
Answer: (D) Aortic regurgitation

Question: A 5-day-old boy is brought to the emergency department because of altered mental status. His mother called an ambulance after finding him grey and unarousable in his crib. The patient was born via cesarean section due to preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM). Since birth, the infant has gained little weight and has been generally fussy. His temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), the pulse is 180/min, the respirations are 80/min, the blood pressure is 50/30 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation is 80% on room air. Physical examination shows a mottled, cyanotic infant who is unresponsive to stimulation. Cardiopulmonary examination shows prominent heart sounds, wet rales in the inferior lungs bilaterally, strong brachial pulses, and absent femoral pulses. Endotracheal intubation is performed immediately and successfully. Which of the following signs would a chest X-ray likely show? (E) Tubular artery sign (C) Tram tracking (D) Tree-in-bud pattern (B) Three sign (A) Target sign
Reason: The answer is (B) Three sign, which is indicative of a specific congenital heart defect known as coarctation of the aorta. The clinical presentation describes a severely cyanotic infant with differential blood flow, evident by strong brachial pulses and absent femoral pulses, suggesting that the upper body is receiving adequate blood supply while the lower body is not. The "three sign" on chest X-ray reflects the appearance of the aorta at the coarctation site and the collateral circulation, making it a likely finding in this scenario.
Answer: (B) Three sign

Question: An investigator studying protein synthesis in human stem cells isolates tRNA molecules bound to mRNA molecules. The isolated tRNA molecules have inosine in the 5' position of the anticodon; of these, some are bound to adenine, some to cytosine, and some to uracil at the 3' position of the mRNA codon. Which of the following properties of the genetic code is best illustrated by this finding? (E) Non-overlapping (B) Specificity of stop codons (A) Specificity of the start codon (C) Degeneracy (D) Unambiguity
Reason: The answer is (C) Degeneracy, which refers to the phenomenon where multiple codons can code for the same amino acid. The presence of inosine in the 5' position of the anticodon allows the tRNA to pair with different codons (that differ in their third position) during protein synthesis, thus illustrating how a single tRNA can recognize multiple codons for a single amino acid, demonstrating the flexible nature of the genetic code. This supports the notion that the genetic code is degenerative, as multiple codons lead to similar end results in protein synthesis.
Answer: (C) Degeneracy

Question: A 49-year-old man with hypertension comes to the hospital because of 4 days of left-sided chest pain, cough, and fever. The chest pain worsens upon inspiration and coughing. His temperature is 38.5°C (101.3° F), pulse is 110/min, respirations are 29/min. There is dullness to percussion at the left base of the lung. An x-ray of the chest shows blunting of the left costophrenic angle. Evaluation of the pleural fluid is most likely to show which of the following findings? (B) Decreased glucose concentration (C) Increased pH (E) Decreased sodium concentration (A) Increased lymphocyte concentration (D) Increased triglyceride concentration
Reason: The correct answer is (B) Decreased glucose concentration. 

This patient’s presentation is suggestive of a parapneumonic effusion or empyema, often associated with pneumonia. In these types of pleural effusions, the inflammatory process can lead to a decrease in glucose concentration in the pleural fluid, due to the consumption of glucose by the inflammatory cells or bacteria present.
Answer: (B) Decreased glucose concentration

Question: A 3-week-old male infant is brought to the physician for follow-up. He was delivered at 30 weeks' gestation via Cesarean section and was cyanotic at birth, requiring resuscitation and a neonatal intensive care unit hospitalization. His mother received no prenatal care; she has diabetes mellitus type II and hypertension. She was not tested for sexually transmitted infections during the pregnancy. The infant appears well. Ophthalmologic examination shows tortuous retinal vessels. There are well-demarcated areas of non-vascularized retina in the periphery. This patient's retinal findings are most likely a result of which of the following? (B) Glucocorticoid deficiency (A) Oxygen toxicity (E) Chlamydia infection (C) Hyperglycemia (D) Syphilis infection
Reason: The correct answer is (A) Oxygen toxicity. 

In this case, the infant's retinal findings, particularly the tortuous retinal vessels and non-vascularized areas in the periphery, are indicative of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). ROP is often associated with the supplemental oxygen provided during neonatal care for preterm infants, which can lead to abnormal retinal blood vessel growth and are consistent with the findings observed in this patient.
Answer: (A) Oxygen toxicity

Question: An 11-month-old boy is brought to the pediatrician by his mother due to fever and tugging at his right ear. The mother says that he is currently irritable with a mild fever. About 1 week ago, he had a mild cough, mild fever, body aches,  and a runny nose. He was treated with children’s Tylenol and the symptoms resolved after a few days. The child lives in an apartment with his mother, grandmother, and father. His grandmother watches him during the day. There have been no sick contacts at home. His father smokes cigarettes on the balcony. There is no pertinent family history. He was born full term by spontaneous vaginal delivery. He is progressing through his developmental milestones and is up to date on his vaccines. His temperature is 39.3°C (102.7°F), pulse is 122/min, and respirations are 24 /min. The child appears cranky and requires consoling during the physical exam. His heart and lung exam are normal. He has a red and mildly swollen right ear. Otoscopic evaluation of the right ear reveals the finding shown in the image below. Which of the following most likely contributed to this patient’s condition? (D) Immunodeficiency (B) Cystic Fibrosis (E) Second hand smoke (A) Day care exposure (C) Trisomy 21
Reason: The correct answer is (E) Second hand smoke. 

In this case, the child is exhibiting classic signs of acute otitis media, which can be aggravated by exposure to secondhand smoke. Children exposed to secondhand smoke are at an increased risk of developing respiratory infections and ear infections, as smoke can impair mucociliary clearance and promote inflammation in the respiratory tract, including the Eustachian tubes and middle ear.
Answer: (E) Second hand smoke

[INFO] Opinion paths:
Path 1: Let's analyze the case step by step.

1. **Symptoms**: The patient has episodes of heart palpitations, chest pain, a fine tremor, and a retraction of the left upper eyelid. These symptoms suggest hyperthyroidism, especially with the presence of tremors and the eye retraction (possibly indicative of Graves' disease).

2. **Heart Rate and Rhythm**: The patient has a pulse of 110/min and irregularly irregular rhythm, which is suggestive of atrial fibrillation (AF).

3. **Additional Findings**: 
   - The systolic ejection murmur along the right upper sternal border could indicate aortic stenosis but is less relevant to the acute management of this patient.
   - Warm extremities and 2+ pulses suggest good peripheral perfusion.

4. **Pharmacotherapy Consideration**: 
   - In patients with atrial fibrillation, especially those who may have hyperthyroidism, the primary goal is to control the heart rate and rhythm.
   - Given the patient's symptoms and findings, a beta-blocker like **Propranolol** is most appropriate. It not only helps control the heart rate but also alleviates symptoms associated with hyperthyroidism.

Answer: (A) Propranolol
Path 2: Let's analyze the patient's presentation step by step.

1. **Symptoms**: The patient has intermittent episodes of heart palpitations, chest pain localized to the left 3rd intercostal space, a pulse of 110/min that is irregularly irregular, and signs of anxiety (appearing nervous). The presence of tremor and digital swelling may suggest a hyperthyroid state.

2. **Physical Exam Findings**: 
   - The retraction of the left upper eyelid could indicate Graves' disease, which is commonly associated with hyperthyroidism.
   - A systolic ejection murmur along the right upper sternal border may suggest some degree of aortic stenosis or flow-related murmur due to increased cardiac output from hyperthyroidism.
   - The warm extremities and 2+ pulses bilaterally indicate good perfusion, likely due to increased metabolic state from hyperthyroidism.

3. **Arrhythmia**: The irregularly irregular pulse suggests atrial fibrillation, which is common in patients with hyperthyroidism.

4. **Pharmacotherapy**: 
   - In hyperthyroid patients with atrial fibrillation, the first-line treatment often includes beta-blockers to control heart rate and reduce symptoms.
   - Propranolol (a non-selective beta-blocker) is effective in controlling symptoms related to hyperthyroidism such as palpitations and tremors.

Given the assessment, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient, considering her symptoms and the likely diagnosis of hyperthyroidism with atrial fibrillation, is:

**Answer: (A) Propranolol**
Path 3: Let's analyze the patient's symptoms step by step:

1. **Symptoms**: The patient presents with heart palpitations, chest pain, nervousness, and a fine tremor. She has an irregularly irregular pulse, which is characteristic of atrial fibrillation. The presence of a systolic ejection murmur and retraction of the left upper eyelid suggests hyperthyroidism (possibly Graves' disease).

2. **Heart Rate and Rhythm**: The pulse is 110/min and irregularly irregular, which indicates atrial fibrillation.

3. **Thyroid Symptoms**: The fine tremor and retraction of the eyelid further support the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism.

4. **Management Considerations**: In patients with atrial fibrillation and hyperthyroidism, it is important to control the heart rate. Beta-blockers such as propranolol are commonly used to manage both the symptoms of hyperthyroidism and control the heart rate in atrial fibrillation.

5. **Options**:
   - (B) Digoxin: Typically used for rate control but not the first-line for hyperthyroid-related atrial fibrillation.
   - (C) Amiodarone: An antiarrhythmic that could be considered but is not first-line for rate control.
   - (A) Propranolol: A beta-blocker that is effective in controlling heart rate and managing symptoms of hyperthyroidism.
   - (D) Warfarin: Anticoagulation may be necessary but is not a direct treatment for the heart rate issue.
   - (E) Diltiazem: A calcium channel blocker that could be considered for rate control but is not as effective for hyperthyroid symptoms.

Considering that the patient likely has atrial fibrillation due to hyperthyroidism, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for both heart rate control and managing hyperthyroid symptoms would be:

**Answer: (A) Propranolol**
Path 4: Let's analyze the case step by step:

1. **Symptoms and Findings**: The patient presents with intermittent heart palpitations, chest pain localized to the left third intercostal space, a pulse that is irregularly irregular, and a fine tremor on both hands. Additionally, there is retraction of the left upper eyelid, which may suggest a thyroid-related issue (e.g., Graves' disease). The patient also has a systolic ejection murmur along the right upper sternal border, which could indicate aortic stenosis but is less relevant given the context.

2. **Vital Signs**: The patient's heart rate is 110/min, which is tachycardic, and the blood pressure is relatively normal.

3. **Clinical Context**: The irregularly irregular pulse suggests atrial fibrillation (AF). The associated symptoms, including tremors and lid retraction, raise suspicion for hyperthyroidism as an underlying etiology.

4. **Management of Atrial Fibrillation**: In a patient with atrial fibrillation, particularly if there are signs of hyperthyroidism, the treatment often includes controlling the heart rate and managing the underlying condition. Beta-blockers like propranolol are effective in controlling the heart rate and can also help with symptoms of hyperthyroidism.

5. **Pharmacotherapy Options**:
   - **(A) Propranolol**: This is a beta-blocker that can help control heart rate and symptoms related to hyperthyroidism.
   - **(B) Digoxin**: Generally reserved for rate control in heart failure or when beta-blockers are contraindicated.
   - **(C) Amiodarone**: An antiarrhythmic used for rhythm control but is not typically first-line for rate control.
   - **(D) Warfarin**: Anticoagulation is important in AF for stroke prevention, but the immediate concern is rate control.
   - **(E) Diltiazem**: A calcium channel blocker that can also control heart rate, but beta-blockers are often preferred in hyperthyroid patients.

Given these considerations, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient, addressing both the atrial fibrillation and the symptoms of potential hyperthyroidism, is:

**Answer: (A) Propranolol**.
Path 5: Let's think step by step. 

The patient presents with symptoms consistent with hyperthyroidism, including palpitations, tachycardia, tremors, and the retraction of the left upper eyelid (which suggests a possible thyroid eye disease). The irregularly irregular pulse indicates atrial fibrillation, which can occur in hyperthyroid patients due to increased adrenergic activity.

In managing atrial fibrillation, especially in a patient with suspected hyperthyroidism, beta-blockers like propranolol are often used. Propranolol not only helps to control the heart rate and alleviate symptoms such as palpitations but also helps in the management of hyperthyroid symptoms.

Given these considerations, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient is:

Answer: (A) Propranolol
Path 6: Let's analyze the patient's symptoms and physical findings step by step:

1. **Age and Gender**: The patient is a 35-year-old woman.
2. **Symptoms**: She has intermittent episodes of heart palpitations, chest pain localized to the left 3rd intercostal space, and appears nervous. The heart rate is 110/min and irregularly irregular, indicating atrial fibrillation.
3. **Physical Exam Findings**: Notable findings include:
   - Fine tremor on both hands (which could indicate hyperthyroidism).
   - Digital swelling (could indicate thyroid-related changes).
   - Retraction of the left upper eyelid (could be a sign of Graves’ disease or hyperthyroidism).
   - A systolic ejection murmur along the right upper sternal border (likely related to increased blood flow due to hyperthyroidism).
   - Warm extremities and 2+ pulses bilaterally (suggesting good perfusion).

Given these findings, the patient likely has hyperthyroidism, possibly Graves' disease, which is causing her atrial fibrillation. 

In terms of pharmacotherapy for atrial fibrillation, especially in the context of hyperthyroidism, the most appropriate first-line treatment would be a beta-blocker to control the heart rate and alleviate symptoms such as tremors and palpitations.

The best choice among the options provided is:

**(A) Propranolol** - This non-selective beta-blocker can help control the heart rate, reduce palpitations, and alleviate symptoms associated with hyperthyroidism.

So, the answer is: **(A) Propranolol**.
Path 7: Let's analyze the symptoms and findings in this case step by step.

1. **Patient Symptoms**: The 35-year-old woman has intermittent heart palpitations, chest pain localized to the left 3rd intercostal space, a fine tremor, digital swelling, and retraction of the left upper eyelid. These signs suggest a hyperthyroid state, possibly due to Graves' disease.

2. **Heart Rate and Rhythm**: The pulse is 110/min and irregularly irregular, which indicates atrial fibrillation (AF). AF is common in hyperthyroid patients due to increased adrenergic tone.

3. **Murmur and Extremity Findings**: The systolic ejection murmur along the right upper sternal border could suggest a flow murmur due to hyperdynamic circulation often seen in hyperthyroid states. Warm extremities and bounding pulses further indicate increased cardiac output, common in hyperthyroidism.

4. **Pharmacotherapy Options**:
   - **Digoxin (B)**: Used to control heart rate in AF but is not first-line in hyperthyroidism.
   - **Amiodarone (C)**: An antiarrhythmic which can be used, but it is not first-line.
   - **Propranolol (A)**: A non-selective beta-blocker that is effective in controlling symptoms of hyperthyroidism (like palpitations and tremors) and also helps control heart rate in AF.
   - **Warfarin (D)**: Anticoagulation for stroke prevention in AF, but not appropriate as first-line treatment for the symptoms described.
   - **Diltiazem (E)**: A calcium channel blocker that can also control heart rate in AF, but it is not the first-line choice for hyperthyroid symptoms.

Given the patient's symptoms indicating hyperthyroidism and the need for rate control due to AF, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy is **Propranolol**.

**Answer: (A) Propranolol**
Path 8: Let's analyze the clinical presentation step by step.

The patient is a 35-year-old woman with intermittent heart palpitations, chest pain, a rapid and irregular pulse (110/min and irregularly irregular), and signs suggestive of hyperthyroidism, such as a fine tremor, digital swelling, retraction of the left upper eyelid (possibly indicative of Graves' disease), and warm extremities. The presence of a systolic ejection murmur along the right upper sternal border may suggest a hyperdynamic circulation often seen in hyperthyroid patients.

Given the symptoms of palpitations, tachycardia, and possible underlying hyperthyroidism, the best initial management for symptomatic relief of palpitations due to tachyarrhythmia in this context would be a beta-blocker. Propranolol is commonly used in hyperthyroidism to help control heart rate and alleviate symptoms.

Therefore, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy in this case is:

**Answer: (A) Propranolol**
Path 9: Let's analyze the patient's symptoms and clinical findings step by step.

1. **Symptoms**: The patient has intermittent episodes of heart palpitations, chest pain localized to the left 3rd intercostal space, and a fine tremor in both hands. She appears nervous and has a rapid pulse of 110/min that is irregularly irregular, suggesting atrial fibrillation.

2. **Physical Examination**: The presence of retraction of the left upper eyelid (possibly indicating Graves' disease), warm extremities, and digital swelling suggests hyperthyroidism. The systolic ejection murmur along the right upper sternal border may imply aortic stenosis or possibly a hyperdynamic state due to increased cardiac output associated with hyperthyroidism.

3. **Diagnosis**: The findings are consistent with hyperthyroidism leading to atrial fibrillation, which commonly occurs due to increased adrenergic tone and metabolic demand.

4. **Pharmacotherapy**: The treatment of choice for symptomatic management of atrial fibrillation, especially in the context of hyperthyroidism, includes beta-blockers to control the heart rate and reduce adrenergic symptoms. Propranolol (A) is a non-selective beta-blocker that can help manage the palpitations and tremors associated with hyperthyroidism.

Given this analysis, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient is:

**Answer: (A) Propranolol**
Path 10: Let's analyze the symptoms and findings presented in the case step by step:

1. **Patient Profile**: A 35-year-old woman with intermittent palpitations, sharp left-sided chest pain, and a nervous appearance.
  
2. **Vital Signs**: Her pulse is 110/min and irregularly irregular, which suggests atrial fibrillation.

3. **Examination Findings**:
   - Fine tremor on both hands: could indicate hyperthyroidism.
   - Digital swelling and retraction of the left upper eyelid: may suggest Graves' disease or hyperthyroid-related exophthalmos.
   - Systolic ejection murmur along the right upper sternal border: could indicate aortic stenosis or another cardiac condition.

4. **Warm extremities and 2+ pulses**: These findings suggest good perfusion, which is typical in hyperthyroid patients.

Given these considerations, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for atrial fibrillation in a patient who is likely hyperthyroid (as suggested by the tremor and eyelid retraction) would be a beta-blocker to control the heart rate and potentially address some symptoms of hyperthyroidism.

Among the options provided, **(A) Propranolol** is the most appropriate choice as it is effective in controlling heart rate and managing symptoms of hyperthyroidism.

Therefore, the answer is: **(A) Propranolol**.

Question: A 2-year-old boy is presented to the pediatrician due to poor weight gain and easy fatigability. His mother states that the patient barely engages in any physical activity as he becomes short of breath easily. The prenatal and birth histories are insignificant. Past medical history includes a few episodes of upper respiratory tract infection that were treated successfully. The patient is in the 10th percentile for weight and 40th percentile for height. The vital signs include: heart rate 122/min and respirations 32/min. Cardiac auscultation reveals clear lungs and a grade 2/6 holosystolic murmur loudest at the left lower sternal border. The remainder of the physical examination is negative for clubbing, cyanosis, and peripheral edema. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient? (D) Coarctation of aorta (E) Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) (A) Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) (C) Ventricular septal defect (VSD) (B) Atrial septal defect (ASD)
Reason: The presentation of the 2-year-old boy, particularly the holosystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border, strongly suggests a holosystolic defect, which is characteristic of a ventricular septal defect (VSD). Additionally, the symptoms of easy fatigability and poor weight gain indicate increased pulmonary blood flow due to left-to-right shunting, which is typical in patients with VSD, thereby aligning the clinical features with the proposed diagnosis.
Answer: (C) Ventricular septal defect (VSD)

Reason: The answer provided seems to indicate a misunderstanding of the context based on the details presented in the vignette. The patient is an 8-year-old boy who has a significantly high body weight (99th percentile for weight) and is in the 30th percentile for height, suggesting he is overweight but not necessarily experiencing precocious puberty. Precocious puberty usually is marked by early secondary sexual characteristics, which is not indicated in this case. Given his high BMI, one should be more concerned about potential related health issues such as hypertension or the risk of developing atherosclerotic heart disease. Therefore, a more fitting outcome would be related to obesity-related complications, not precocious puberty. 

Thus, a clearer understanding of the boy's metrics and health concerns could lead to the conclusion that issues such as hypertension or related cardiovascular risks are more appropriate outcomes to consider than precocious puberty.
Answer: (D) Precocious puberty

Question: An 8-year-old boy presents to his primary care pediatrician for routine check-up. During the visit, his mom says that she has noticed yellow bumps on his eyelids and was concerned about whether they were a problem. Upon hearing this concern, the physician inquires about parental health studies and learns that both parents have high cholesterol despite adhering to a statin regimen. Furthermore, other family members have suffered early myocardial infarctions in their 30s. Physical exam reveals flat yellow patches on the patient's eyelids bilaterally as well as hard yellow bumps around the patient's ankles. Based on clinical suspicion an LDL level is obtained and shows a level of 300 mg/dL. What protein is most likely defective in this patient causing these findings? (D) Apoprotein B48 (C) VLDL receptor (B) LDL receptor (E) Apoprotein E (A) Lipoprotein lipase
Reason: The patient's presentation is highly suggestive of familial hypercholesterolemia, characterized by elevated LDL cholesterol levels and xanthomas (the yellow bumps noted on the eyelids and ankles). In this condition, a defect in the LDL receptor impairs the clearance of LDL particles from the bloodstream, leading to significantly high LDL levels, which aligns with the patient's LDL measurement of 300 mg/dL and the family history of early cardiovascular disease. This finding confirms that the most likely defective protein in this patient is the LDL receptor.
Answer: (B) LDL receptor

Question: A 23-year-old G1P0 woman presents to the emergency department with regular and painful contractions that occur every 3 minutes. She was at home cooking dinner when she experienced a deluge of clear fluid between her legs followed by painful contractions. The patient has a past medical history of obesity. Her pregnancy was not followed by an obstetrician, but she notes that she experienced abdominal pain and headaches frequently towards the end of her pregnancy. Her temperature is 99.5°F (37.5°C), blood pressure is 187/128 mmHg, pulse is 110/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. The patient is started on magnesium sulfate and labetalol. The patient delivers her baby vaginally 2 hours later. On the labor and delivery floor, the patient is notably somnolent. Vitals are notable for respirations of 6 per minute. Physical exam reveals a somnolent woman who is minimally responsive. Cardiopulmonary exam is notable for hypopnea. Neurological exam reveals absent deep tendon reflexes and 3/5 strength in her upper and lower extremities. Which of the following is the next best step in management? (A) CT scan of the head (C) Remove retained fetal parts (E) Ultrasound (D) Supportive therapy (B) Discontinue current drug infusion
Reason: The symptoms exhibited by the patient, such as somnolence, respiratory depression (noted as hypopnea and low respiratory rate), absent deep tendon reflexes, and diminished strength, are indicative of magnesium sulfate toxicity. Since magnesium sulfate is known to cause these side effects when administered, the immediate and appropriate next step in management would be to discontinue the infusion of magnesium sulfate to prevent further complications and address the toxicity.
Answer: (B) Discontinue current drug infusion

Question: A 5-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his parents because of a 6-week history of increased tiredness, irritability, and worsening leg pain. His parents report that he has been reluctant to walk recently because of the pain in his legs. Examination shows conjunctival pallor and diffuse petechiae. There are palpable, nontender posterior cervical and axillary lymph nodes. His hemoglobin concentration is 8.9 g/dL, leukocyte count is 45,750/mm3, and platelet count is 25,000/mm3. A bone marrow aspiration shows numerous immature cells that stain positive for CD10, CD19, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT). Which of the following translocations is associated with a favorable prognosis for this patient's condition? (E) t(9;22) (B) t(15;17) (A) t(12;21) (D) t(14;18) (C) t(8;14)
Reason: The boy's clinical presentation and laboratory findings suggest a diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), which is characterized by high leukocyte counts and the presence of immature lymphoid cells. The t(12;21) translocation is associated with a subtype of ALL that has a more favorable prognosis compared to other translocations, such as t(9;22), which is linked with poorer outcomes.

Question: A 27-year-old man interested in pre-exposure therapy for HIV (PrEP) is being evaluated to qualify for a PrEP study. In order to qualify, patients must be HIV- and hepatitis B- and C-negative. Any other sexually transmitted infections require treatment prior to initiation of PrEP. The medical history is positive for a prior syphilis infection and bipolar affective disorder, for which he takes lithium. On his next visit, the liver and renal enzymes are within normal ranges. HIV and hepatitis B and C tests are negative. Which of the following about the HIV test is true? (E) A secondary reagent is needed to interpret the results. (B) It is a qualitative test used for screening purposes. (C) An unknown antigen binds to the known serum. (D) A known antigen binds to the patient’s serum. (A) It is a quantitative test used for screening purposes.
Reason: The HIV test mentioned in the scenario is primarily designed to determine the presence or absence of HIV antibodies in the serum, making it a qualitative assessment rather than a quantitative one. This type of test is used for screening purposes, as it identifies whether an individual is infected with HIV, which helps in evaluating eligibility for treatments like PrEP.
Answer: (B) It is a qualitative test used for screening purposes.

Question: A 52-year-old woman comes to the physician because of vaginal itchiness and urinary frequency for the past 1 year. She stopped having vaginal intercourse with her husband because it became painful and occasionally resulted in vaginal spotting. Her last menstrual cycle was 14 months ago. She has vitiligo. Her only medication is a topical tacrolimus ointment. Her temperature is 37.1°C (98.8°F), pulse is 85/min, and blood pressure is 135/82 mm Hg. Examination shows multiple white maculae on her forearms, abdomen, and feet. Pelvic examination shows scarce pubic hair, vulvar pallor, and narrowing of the vaginal introitus. Which of the following most likely contributes to this patient's current symptoms? (E) Sclerosis of the dermis (B) Inflammation of the vestibular glands (D) Dysplasia of the epithelium (C) Decrease of pH (A) Thinning of the mucosa
Reason: The correct answer is (A) Thinning of the mucosa. This patient's symptoms, including vaginal itchiness, pain during intercourse, and the description of vulvar pallor and narrowing of the vaginal introitus, suggest a condition such as vulvovaginal atrophy, which occurs due to decreased estrogen levels post-menopause. This decrease in estrogen leads to atrophy of the vaginal and vulvar tissues, resulting in thinning of the mucosa, which can cause the symptoms she is experiencing.

Question: A 49-year-old man with HIV comes to the physician because of a 1-month history of intermittent diarrhea and abdominal pain. Abdominal examination shows mild, diffuse tenderness throughout the lower quadrants. His CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 180/mm3 (normal ≥ 500/mm3). Colonoscopy shows multiple hemorrhagic nodules in the rectum and descending colon. Polymerase chain reaction of the lesions is positive for HHV-8. Histologic examination of the lesions is most likely to show which of the following findings? (A) Cords of atypical cells with extracellular mucin (B) Enlarged cells with intranuclear inclusion bodies (E) Mucin-filled cell with peripheral nucleus (C) Polygonal cells with racket-shaped organelles (D) Spindle-shaped cells with leukocytic infiltration
Reason: The correct answer is (D) Spindle-shaped cells with leukocytic infiltration. This patient's diagnosis is consistent with Kaposi's sarcoma, which is associated with HHV-8 (human herpesvirus 8) and presents as lesions characterized by spindle-shaped tumor cells and inflammatory infiltrate, including leukocytes. The presence of these spindle-shaped cells, combined with the patient's immunocompromised state due to low CD4+ counts, supports the likelihood of this finding on histologic examination.

Question: A 5-year-old patient is brought to the emergency department by his parents for concerning behavior. His parents relate that over the past 3 weeks, he has had multiple episodes of staring into space, lip smacking, and clasping his hands together. The patient has his eyes open during these episode but does not respond to his parents’ voice or his name. These episodes last between 1-2 minutes after which the patient appears to return back to awareness. The patient is confused after these episodes and appears not to know where he is for about 15 minutes. These episodes occur once every few days and the most recent one happened about 10 minutes before the patient arrived to the emergency department. On arrival, the patient is mildly confused and does not know where he is or what recently happened. He is slow to respond to questions and appears tired. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient? (C) Generalized tonic-clonic seizure (A) Simple partial seizure (E) Syncopal episodes (B) Complex partial seizure (D) Absence seizure
Reason: The correct answer is (B) Complex partial seizure. This patient's episodes involve staring, lip-smacking, and hand movements, along with a lack of responsiveness, which are characteristic features of complex partial seizures. Additionally, the postictal confusion he exhibits after the episodes, lasting about 15 minutes, further supports this diagnosis, as it is common in complex partial seizures due to the involvement of a larger area of the brain and subsequent disorientation after the event.

Question: A 28-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of multiple right inframammary lumps. They are tender and have a foul-smelling odor. She has had previous episodes of painful swellings in the axillae 12 months ago that resolved with antibiotic therapy, leaving some scarring. She has Crohn disease. Menses occur at irregular 18- to 40-day intervals and last 1–5 days. The patient's only medication is mesalamine. She appears anxious. She is 162 cm (5 ft 4 in) tall and weighs 87 kg (192 lb); BMI is 33 kg/m2. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the right inframammary fold shows multiple tender, erythematous nodules and fistulas with purulent discharge. Hirsutism is present. Her fasting glucose concentration is 136 mg/dL. Which of the following areas is most likely to also be affected by this patient's condition? (E) Back
" (D) Shin (B) Central face (C) Groin (A) Forehead
Reason: The patient is likely suffering from hidradenitis suppurativa, a chronic skin condition characterized by painful lumps, abscesses, and scarring in areas where skin rubs together, such as the inframammary region and groin. Given her symptoms, along with the history of painful axillary swellings and the presence of hirsutism, it indicates that similar lesions could be found in the groin area due to the nature of the disease's distribution.

Question: A patient presents to the clinic with symptoms of dizziness on standing up. He says it started soon after he was diagnosed with hypertension and started taking treatment for it. He has no other medical history. The physician decides to switch to another antihypertensive that does not cause orthostatic hypotension. Which of the following should be the drug of choice for this patient? (A) Enalapril (B) Methyldopa (C) Clonidine (E) Propanolol (D) Amlodipine
Reason: The answer should actually be reevaluated, as propranolol (E) is a non-selective beta-blocker that can sometimes cause dizziness, particularly upon standing, and is not the best choice for treating hypertension without orthostatic hypotension. A more suitable option could be amlodipine (D), a calcium channel blocker that is known for not typically causing postural changes in blood pressure, thereby reducing incidents of orthostatic hypotension in patients. So the reasoning supporting the choice of Amlodipine (D) is that it effectively controls blood pressure while minimizing the risk of orthostatic symptoms.
Answer: (E) Propanolol

Question: A 38-year-old man with chronic hepatitis C comes to the physician because of a 10-day history of darkening of his skin and painless blisters. He started working as a landscaper 2 weeks ago. He drinks 2 beers every night and occasionally more on the weekends. Examination shows bullae and oozing erosions in different stages of healing on his arms, dorsal hands, and face. There are atrophic white scars and patches of hyperpigmented skin on the arms and face. This patient's skin findings are most likely associated with increased concentration of which of the following? (C) Delta-aminolevulinic acid (B) Porphobilinogen (A) Protoporphyrin (D) Uroporphyrinogen III (E) Unconjugated bilirubin
Reason: The patient's symptoms, which include blistering and hyperpigmentation of the skin, are indicative of porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT), a condition that is often associated with liver disease, such as chronic hepatitis C. In PCT, there is a deficiency of the enzyme uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase, leading to an accumulation of uroporphyrin, specifically uroporphyrinogen III, in the urine and skin, which is responsible for the patient's symptoms. Thus, uroporphyrinogen III is elevated in this condition.

He also reports recurrent episodes of throbbing headaches, diaphoresis, and palpitations. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. He takes no medications. His vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination and an ECG show no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show calcium concentration of 12 mg/dL, phosphorus concentration of 2 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase concentration of 100 U/L, and calcitonin concentration of 11 pg/mL (N < 8.8). Ultrasonography of the neck shows hypoechoic thyroid lesions with irregular margins and microcalcifications. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition? (D) Altered RET proto-oncogene expression (B) Exposure to ionizing radiation (C) Deleted VHL gene (A) Mutated NF1 gene (E) Disrupted menin protein function
Reason: The patient's symptoms, laboratory findings, and imaging results are highly suggestive of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2), which involves medullary thyroid carcinoma and is commonly associated with mutations in the RET proto-oncogene. The presence of elevated calcitonin, elevated calcium levels, and thyroid lesions with suspicious characteristics further support this diagnosis, making altered RET proto-oncogene expression the most likely underlying cause.

Question: A 38-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 2, is brought to the emergency department by her husband after an episode of unconsciousness. She delivered a healthy infant two weeks ago and the postpartum course was complicated by severe vaginal bleeding, for which she required 4 units of packed red blood cells. Since the blood transfusion, she has had decreased milk production and has felt fatigued. Her pulse is 118/min and blood pressure is 104/63 mm Hg. Her finger-stick glucose concentration is 34 mg/dL. Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone and thyroxine levels are low and the serum sodium level is 132 mEq/L. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's condition? (C) Adrenal hemorrhage (A) Postpartum thyroiditis (D) Hypothalamic infarction (E) Pituitary ischemia (B) Lactotrophic adenoma
Reason: The patient's presentation of unconsciousness, fatigue, low serum glucose, and low thyroid-stimulating hormone along with hypotension strongly suggests adrenal insufficiency, which may occur due to pituitary ischemia following significant blood loss during childbirth. The timing of her symptoms soon after a complicated delivery with massive transfusion aligns with Sheehan's syndrome, where pituitary tissue may become necrotic due to decreased blood supply, leading to pituitary failure and resulting hormonal deficiencies.

Question: A 64-year-old man with longstanding ischemic heart disease presents to the clinic with complaints of increasing exercise intolerance and easy fatigability for the past 2 weeks. He further states that he has been experiencing excessive daytime somnolence and shortness of breath with exertion. His wife adds that his shortness of breath is more in the recumbent position, and after approximately 2 hours of sleep, after which he suddenly wakes up suffocating and gasping for breath. This symptom is relieved after assuming an upright position for more than 30 minutes. The vital signs are as follows: heart rate, 126/min; respiratory rate, 16/min; temperature, 37.6°C (99.6°F); and blood pressure, 122/70 mm Hg. The physical examination reveals a S3 gallop on cardiac auscultation and positive hepatojugular reflux with distended neck veins. An electrocardiogram shows ischemic changes similar to ECG changes noted in the past. An echocardiogram reveals an ejection fraction of 33%. Which of the following best describes the respiratory pattern abnormality which occurs in this patient while sleeping? (E) Shortened lung-to-brain circulation time (D) Increased partial pressure of oxygen (B) Decreased sympathetic activity (C) Decreased central hypercapnic ventilatory responsiveness (A) Increased pulmonary artery pressure
Reason: The symptoms presented by the patient, including shortness of breath while recumbent, gasping for breath, and relief upon sitting upright, suggest the presence of pulmonary congestion related to heart failure. The reduced ejection fraction and signs of fluid overload, such as the S3 gallop and positive hepatojugular reflux, indicate that the patient's heart is unable to maintain adequate cardiac output, likely leading to increased pulmonary artery pressure, particularly during sleep when he is lying down.
Answer: (A) Increased pulmonary artery pressure

Question: A 5-day-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his mother because of a 2-day history of difficulty feeding and multiple episodes of his lips turning blue. He was born at home via spontaneous vaginal delivery and Apgar scores were 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. Physical examination shows grunting and moderate intercostal and subcostal retractions. Echocardiography shows a single vessel exiting from the heart. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition? (E) Abnormal cardiac looping (A) Failure of neural crest cell migration (C) Abnormal placement of the infundibular septum (D) Absent fusion of septum primum and septum secundum (B) Insufficient growth of endocardial cushions
Reason: The patient's presentation suggests a conotruncal heart defect, likely a form of a single ventricle physiology, which can result from failure of neural crest cell migration during development. Neural crest cells play a critical role in the formation of the outflow tracts and septation of the heart, and their improper development can lead to the observed anomalies, such as a single vessel exiting from the heart, typically seen in conditions like truncus arteriosus or tetralogy of Fallot.
Answer: (A) Failure of neural crest cell migration

Question: An 11-year-old girl presents to her pediatrician for evaluation of asymmetry that was detected during routine school screening. Specifically, she was asked to bend forwards while the school nurse examined her back. While leaning forward, her right scapula was found to be higher than her left scapula. She was also found to have a prominent line of spinal processes that diverged from the midline. She has been experiencing some back pain that she previously attributed to growth pains but otherwise has no symptoms. Her past medical history is significant only for mild allergies. She is sent to radiography for confirmation of the diagnosis and placed in a nighttime brace. Which of the following represents a complication of the most likely disease affecting this patient if it is left untreated? (E) Restrictive lung disease (B) Congestive heart failure (D) Obstructive lung disease (C) Dislocation of the shoulders (A) Arrhythmia
Reason: The clinical presentation of spinal asymmetry and the prominence of the spinal processes suggests that the patient likely has scoliosis. If left untreated, significant scoliosis can lead to structural changes in the chest wall and thoracic cavity, which may ultimately result in restrictive lung disease due to compromised lung capacity and function. Thus, the most relevant complication associated with untreated scoliosis is the development of restrictive lung disease.
Answer: (E) Restrictive lung disease

Question: A 14-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department because of acute left-sided chest pain and dyspnea following a motor vehicle accident. His pulse is 122/min and blood pressure is 85/45 mm Hg. Physical examination shows distended neck veins and tracheal displacement to the right side. The left chest is hyperresonant to percussion and there are decreased breath sounds. This patient would most benefit from needle insertion at which of the following anatomical sites? (C) 8th left intercostal space along the posterior axillary line (A) 2nd left intercostal space along the midclavicular line (E) 5th left intercostal space along the midclavicular line (D) Subxiphoid space in the left sternocostal margin (B) 5th left intercostal space along the midaxillary line
Reason: The correct answer is (A) 2nd left intercostal space along the midclavicular line. This anatomical site is the recommended location for needle decompression in cases of tension pneumothorax, which is suggested by the clinical findings of distended neck veins, tracheal deviation, hyperresonance on percussion, and decreased breath sounds. Placing the needle here allows for the rapid release of trapped air in the pleural space, alleviating life-threatening respiratory distress.

Question: A six-month-old infant presents with chronic, persistent diarrhea, oral thrush, and a severe diaper rash. The infant was treated four weeks ago for an upper respiratory and ear infection. A family history is significant for a consanguineous relationship between the mother and father. Physical examination demonstrates the absence of palpable lymph nodes. Accumulation of which of the following would lead to this disease phenotype? (C) Galactitol (A) Deoxyadenosine (D) Ceramide trihexoside (E) Sphingomyelin (B) Phenylalanine
Reason: The correct answer is (A) Deoxyadenosine. The symptoms presented in this infant, such as chronic diarrhea, oral thrush, and severe diaper rash, are indicative of a disorder related to immunodeficiency, possibly due to adenosine deaminase deficiency, which leads to an accumulation of deoxyadenosine. This accumulation is particularly harmful to lymphoid tissues, resulting in the infant's observable symptoms and lack of palpable lymph nodes.

Question: A 72-year-old man with coronary artery disease comes to the emergency department because of chest pain and shortness of breath for the past 3 hours. Troponin levels are elevated and an ECG shows ST-elevations in the precordial leads. Revascularization with percutaneous coronary intervention is performed, and a stent is successfully placed in the left anterior descending artery. Two days later, he complains of worsening shortness of breath. Pulse oximetry on 3L of nasal cannula shows an oxygen saturation of 89%. An x-ray of the chest shows distended pulmonary veins, small horizontal lines at the lung bases, and blunting of the costophrenic angles bilaterally. Which of the following findings would be most likely on a ventilation-perfusion scan of this patient? (B) Normal ventilation with multiple, bilateral perfusion defects (C) Matched ventilation and perfusion bilaterally (D) Normal perfusion with bilateral ventilation defects (E) Normal perfusion with decreased ventilation at the right base (A) Increased apical ventilation with normal perfusion bilaterally
Reason: The correct answer is (D) Normal perfusion with bilateral ventilation defects. The patient's recent stenting and subsequent development of shortness of breath, along with the chest x-ray findings of distended pulmonary veins and small lines suggestive of pulmonary edema, indicate an increase in lung fluid and a potential issue with ventilation rather than perfusion. This situation would typically be characterized by normal blood flow (perfusion) to the lungs with compromised air exchange (ventilation) due to fluid in the alveoli, reflecting in the ventilation-perfusion scan as normal perfusion with bilateral ventilation defects.
Answer: (D) Normal perfusion with bilateral ventilation defects

Question: A 58-year-old woman presents with vision loss in her right eye. She noticed the visual changes the morning of presentation and has never experienced this visual disturbance before. Her medical history is significant for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and type II diabetes mellitus. She is currently on lisinopril, lovastatin, and metformin. She has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for the last 25 years and also is a social drinker. On physical exam, her lids and lashes appear normal and there is no conjunctival injection. Both pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light; however, when the penlight is swung from the left eye to the right eye, there is bilateral pupillary dilation. The nerve that is most likely defective in this patient relays information to which of the following? (C) Edinger-Westphal nucleus (A) Medial geniculate nucleus (E) Ventral posteromedial nucleus (D) Oculomotor nucleus (B) Lateral geniculate nucleus
Reason: The correct answer is (B) Lateral geniculate nucleus. The bilateral pupillary dilation observed when the penlight is swung from one eye to the other suggests an issue with the pathways that control pupillary reflexes, primarily involving the visual pathways. Since the lateral geniculate nucleus is crucial for relaying visual information from the retina to the visual cortex, it aligns with the patient's visual disturbance and abnormal pupillary response.

Question: A 28-year-old woman visits her physician with complaints of inability to become pregnant despite frequent unprotected sexual intercourse with her husband for over a year. She breastfed her only child until about 13 months ago, when the couple decided to have a second child. Over the past year, the patient has had only 4 episodes of menstrual bleeding. She reports occasional milk discharge from both breasts. Her only medication currently is daily pantoprazole, which she takes for dyspepsia. Her BMI is 29 kg/m2. Physical examination and vitals are normal. Pelvic examination indicates no abnormalities. The patient’s breast examination reveals full breasts and a few drops of milk can be expressed from both nipples. Estradiol, serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), testosterone, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels are within the normal range. Which of the following best explains these findings? (B) Primary ovarian insufficiency (C) Prolactinoma (E) Normal findings (A) Pantoprazole (D) Sheehan’s syndrome
Reason: The correct answer is (C) Prolactinoma. The patient's symptoms, including amenorrhea (infrequent menstrual bleeding), galactorrhea (milky discharge from the breasts), and difficulty conceiving, suggest hyperprolactinemia, which is commonly caused by a prolactinoma. Since her other hormone levels are normal, the presence of elevated prolactin from a prolactinoma would be the most likely explanation for her clinical presentation.
Answer: (C) Prolactinoma

Path 1: Let's analyze the options step by step.

The question asks why capsular polysaccharides are conjugated to protein carriers in vaccine development, specifically for vaccines like Hib.

1. **Understanding Capsular Polysaccharides**: Capsular polysaccharides from bacteria are typically T cell-independent antigens, meaning they can induce antibody production without T cell help. However, the immune response generated by T cell-independent antigens is usually not as robust or long-lasting.

2. **Purpose of Conjugation**: By conjugating these polysaccharides to a protein carrier (like tetanus toxoid), the immune system recognizes the protein as a T cell-dependent antigen. This allows for a more robust immune response, including:
   - Activation of helper T cells
   - Class switching from IgM to IgG
   - Development of immunological memory

Now let's analyze the options:

- **(D)** Conjugation with a protein carrier improves vaccine stability: While this might be true, it does not directly address the immunological benefits.
  
- **(E)** Conjugation with a protein carrier provides effective protection to infants: This is a related point but doesn't specifically address the immunological mechanism.
  
- **(B)** Conjugation with a protein carrier generates IgM dominant antibody responses: This is incorrect; conjugation actually helps to generate IgG responses, not just IgM.
  
- **(A)** Conjugation with a protein carrier generates IgG2 dominant antibody responses: This is partially correct, but generally, conjugation leads to a broader IgG response, not specifically IgG2.
  
- **(C)** Polysaccharides conjugated with proteins are T cell-independent antigens: This is incorrect; the purpose of conjugation is to convert T cell-independent polysaccharides into T cell-dependent antigens.

The most fitting response based on the purpose of conjugation is:

**Answer: (E) Conjugation with a protein carrier provides effective protection to infants.**

This option implies that the conjugation enhances the immune response in a population (e.g., infants) that may not respond adequately to T cell-independent antigens alone.
Path 2: Let's analyze the options step by step in relation to the question about the conjugation of capsular polysaccharides to protein carriers in vaccine development.

1. **Understanding Capsular Polysaccharides**: Capsular polysaccharides from bacteria are generally T cell-independent antigens, which means they can stimulate B cells to produce antibodies without the help of T cells. However, this response is typically weak, especially in infants.

2. **Why Conjugate to Protein Carriers**: By conjugating capsular polysaccharides to protein carriers (like tetanus toxoid), the vaccine can elicit a T cell-dependent immune response. This is crucial because T cell-dependent responses are generally stronger and lead to a more robust immunological memory.

3. **Analyzing the Options**:
   - (D) Conjugation with a protein carrier improves vaccine stability: While this may be true, it's not the primary reason for conjugation.
   - (E) Conjugation with a protein carrier provides effective protection to infants: This is true because it enhances the immune response in infants, but it doesn't specify the immunological mechanisms involved.
   - (B) Conjugation with a protein carrier generates IgM dominant antibody responses: This is incorrect; conjugation typically leads to IgG responses.
   - (A) Conjugation with a protein carrier generates IgG2 dominant antibody responses: This is a relevant statement, as T cell-dependent responses typically involve IgG production.
   - (C) Polysaccharides conjugated with proteins are T cell-independent antigens: This is incorrect; conjugating the polysaccharides to proteins allows them to become T cell-dependent antigens.

Given this analysis, the best response to explain the reason for conjugating capsular polysaccharides to protein carriers in the context of vaccine development is:

**Answer: (E) Conjugation with a protein carrier provides effective protection to infants**. 

This option captures the essence of improving the immune response in a vulnerable population like infants, which is the overarching goal of such conjugate vaccines.
Path 3: Let's think step by step. 

The question revolves around the reason for conjugating capsular polysaccharides to protein carriers in vaccine development, particularly for vaccines against bacteria like Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib).

1. **Understanding Capsular Polysaccharides**: Capsular polysaccharides from bacteria often elicit a T cell-independent immune response, which is not very effective in young children (infants). This is because infants have an immature immune system that responds poorly to T cell-independent antigens.

2. **Role of Protein Carriers**: By conjugating polysaccharides to a protein carrier (like tetanus toxoid), the immune system can recognize the polysaccharide as a T cell-dependent antigen. This allows for the activation of helper T cells, which in turn leads to a more robust immune response, including the production of high-affinity IgG antibodies.

3. **IgG Responses**: The conjugation results in the generation of IgG antibodies rather than the IgM response that typically results from T cell-independent antigens.

4. **Infant Vaccination**: This approach is particularly beneficial for infants, who would not mount a sufficient immune response to polysaccharides alone.

Given this understanding, the best response to the medical student's question is:

**(E) Conjugation with a protein carrier provides effective protection to infants.**

This option correctly highlights the importance of protein carriers in enhancing the immune response in a population that is particularly vulnerable to infections caused by encapsulated bacteria, such as infants.
Path 4: Let's analyze the options step by step:

1. **Understanding the role of capsular polysaccharides**: Polysaccharide capsules from bacteria can elicit an immune response, but they primarily stimulate B cells and do not effectively activate T cells. This leads to predominantly IgM responses, which are not as effective in terms of immunological memory and long-term immunity.

2. **Importance of protein carriers**: By conjugating the polysaccharide to a protein carrier (like tetanus toxoid), the vaccine can stimulate T cell responses. This process converts the polysaccharide into a T cell-dependent antigen, which enhances the immune response, leading to the production of class-switched antibodies (IgG) and a better memory response.

3. **Evaluating the options**:
   - **(D)** Conjugation with a protein carrier improves vaccine stability: This is somewhat true, but not the primary reason for conjugation.
   - **(E)** Conjugation with a protein carrier provides effective protection to infants: While true, it does not explain the mechanism of action.
   - **(B)** Conjugation with a protein carrier generates IgM dominant antibody responses: This is incorrect; the goal is to generate a better response than just IgM.
   - **(A)** Conjugation with a protein carrier generates IgG2 dominant antibody responses: This is more accurate as it emphasizes the T cell-dependent response and class switching.
   - **(C)** Polysaccharides conjugated with proteins are T cell-independent antigens: This is incorrect; the conjugation is done to make them T cell-dependent.

Given this analysis, the best response to the question about why capsular polysaccharides are conjugated to protein carriers during vaccine development is:

**Answer: (A) Conjugation with a protein carrier generates IgG2 dominant antibody responses.**
Path 5: Let's analyze the question step by step. The question asks why capsular polysaccharides are conjugated to protein carriers during vaccine development, particularly in the context of the Hib vaccine.

1. **Understanding Polysaccharide Vaccines**: Capsular polysaccharides from bacteria often elicit a T-cell independent immune response, primarily resulting in IgM antibody production. However, T-cell independent responses are generally less robust, especially in infants.

2. **Role of Protein Carriers**: Conjugating polysaccharides to protein carriers transforms the immune response from T-cell independent to T-cell dependent. This leads to a more effective immune response, including the generation of class-switched antibodies (IgG) and immunological memory.

3. **Infant Immunology**: Infants, particularly those under two years of age, do not respond well to polysaccharide vaccines alone. By conjugating these polysaccharides to proteins, the vaccines can stimulate a T-cell dependent response, which is crucial for generating effective immune protection in infants.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- (D) Conjugation with a protein carrier improves vaccine stability: While this might be true, it does not address the primary immunological rationale for conjugation.
- (E) Conjugation with a protein carrier provides effective protection to infants: This is a strong choice because it highlights the importance of inducing a T-cell dependent response in a population (infants) that would otherwise have a poor response to polysaccharide antigens alone.
- (B) Conjugation with a protein carrier generates IgM dominant antibody responses: This is incorrect because conjugation aims to generate IgG responses.
- (A) Conjugation with a protein carrier generates IgG2 dominant antibody responses: This is partially correct but not as encompassing as option (E).
- (C) Polysaccharides conjugated with proteins are T cell-independent antigens: This is incorrect because the conjugation is to make them T cell-dependent.

The best response to the question is (E) Conjugation with a protein carrier provides effective protection to infants. This emphasizes the critical role that conjugation plays in enhancing the immune response in a vulnerable population. 

Answer: (E) Conjugation with a protein carrier provides effective protection to infants.
Path 6: Let's analyze the options step by step:

1. **Understanding Capsular Polysaccharide Vaccines**: Capsular polysaccharides from bacteria like Hib, Neisseria meningitidis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae can be poorly immunogenic, especially in infants, because they are T cell-independent antigens. This means they do not elicit a strong immune response on their own, particularly in younger children.

2. **Role of Protein Carriers**: By conjugating these polysaccharides to protein carriers (like tetanus toxoid), the immune system can recognize the combined structure as a T cell-dependent antigen. This leads to better activation of T helper cells, which in turn helps B cells produce a more robust immune response, including the generation of high-affinity IgG antibodies.

3. **Evaluating the Options**:
   - (D) Conjugation with a protein carrier improves vaccine stability: While this might be true, it's not the primary reason for conjugation in the context of immunogenicity.
   - (E) Conjugation with a protein carrier provides effective protection to infants: This is a broader statement; it is indeed true, but not specific enough.
   - (B) Conjugation with a protein carrier generates IgM dominant antibody responses: This is incorrect; T cell-dependent responses typically lead to IgG responses, not IgM.
   - (A) Conjugation with a protein carrier generates IgG2 dominant antibody responses: This is correct; protein carriers enhance IgG production.
   - (C) Polysaccharides conjugated with proteins are T cell-independent antigens: This is incorrect; conjugation helps make them T cell-dependent.

4. **Best Response**: The best response to the medical student's question is that conjugation with a protein carrier enhances the immunogenicity of the polysaccharide, leading to a T cell-dependent immune response that generates a stronger IgG response, particularly in infants.

**Answer**: (E) Conjugation with a protein carrier provides effective protection to infants.
Path 7: To answer the question, we need to understand the role of protein carriers in polysaccharide vaccines.

Polysaccharide antigens, such as those from the capsules of some bacteria, can elicit a T cell-independent immune response, primarily resulting in the production of IgM antibodies. However, for a more robust and effective immune response, especially in infants who have immature immune systems, conjugating these polysaccharides to protein carriers enhances the immune response.

When polysaccharides are conjugated to protein carriers, they become T cell-dependent antigens. This allows for the activation of helper T cells, which in turn promotes the class switching of B cells from producing IgM to producing IgG, particularly IgG2, and generates a more substantial and long-lasting immune response.

Given this understanding, the best response to the medical student's question is:

**(E) Conjugation with a protein carrier provides effective protection to infants.**

This response encapsulates the essence of why conjugation is essential in vaccine development against encapsulated bacteria, especially for vulnerable populations like infants.
Path 8: Let's think through the options step by step in the context of vaccine development for polysaccharide encapsulated bacteria.

The primary issue with polysaccharide vaccines, particularly in young children, is that they often elicit a T cell-independent immune response. This response is usually dominated by IgM antibodies and does not generate a robust and long-lasting immune response, particularly in infants and young children who may not respond adequately to T cell-independent antigens.

Conjugating polysaccharides to a protein carrier, such as tetanus toxoid, converts the response to a T cell-dependent response. This is important because T cell-dependent responses lead to the generation of memory cells and the production of high-affinity IgG antibodies, which provide better protection and a more effective immune response.

Now, let's evaluate the options:

- (D) Conjugation with a protein carrier improves vaccine stability: While this might be true, it is not the primary reason for conjugation in the context of immune response.
- (E) Conjugation with a protein carrier provides effective protection to infants: This is somewhat true but vague; it does not directly address the mechanism of how it works.
- (B) Conjugation with a protein carrier generates IgM dominant antibody responses: This is incorrect, as conjugation aims to shift the response away from IgM.
- (A) Conjugation with a protein carrier generates IgG2 dominant antibody responses: This is partially correct but still does not address the broader aspect of T cell involvement.
- (C) Polysaccharides conjugated with proteins are T cell-independent antigens: This statement is incorrect; conjugation aims to make the response T cell-dependent.

Given this analysis, the best response to the question about why capsular polysaccharides are conjugated to protein carriers during vaccine development is:

**(E) Conjugation with a protein carrier provides effective protection to infants.**

This answer captures the essence of the immune system's improved response due to the T cell dependence that arises from the conjugation.
Path 9: Let's analyze the question step by step. 

The medical student is curious about why capsular polysaccharides from bacteria are conjugated to protein carriers during vaccine development, specifically for polysaccharide vaccines like those for Hib, Neisseria meningitidis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae.

1. **Understanding Capsular Polysaccharides**: These polysaccharides alone typically elicit a T cell-independent immune response, which often results in IgM-dominant antibody responses. This type of response is generally weaker and does not generate immunological memory effectively, especially in young children.

2. **Role of Protein Carriers**: When capsular polysaccharides are conjugated to protein carriers (such as tetanus toxoid), they can elicit a T cell-dependent immune response. This type of response is more robust and results in the generation of IgG antibodies, and it also promotes class switching and memory B cell formation.

3. **Infant Immune Response**: The combination with protein carriers is particularly important for infants, who may have a limited ability to respond to T cell-independent antigens (like polysaccharides). 

Given this understanding, the best response to the student's question would be:

**(E) Conjugation with a protein carrier provides effective protection to infants.**

This answer highlights the importance of protein carriers in enhancing the immune response, particularly in populations like infants who are at greater risk for infections from encapsulated organisms.
Path 10: To determine the best response to the question regarding why capsular polysaccharides are conjugated to protein carriers in vaccine development, we need to consider the immunological principles involved.

Capsular polysaccharides, such as those from Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), are typically T cell-independent antigens. When administered alone, they primarily provoke an IgM response and do not generate a robust immunological memory or an effective response in infants, who often have immature immune systems.

By conjugating these polysaccharides to protein carriers, such as tetanus toxoid, the immune response is significantly improved. This conjugation allows the polysaccharide to be presented to T cells, which in turn can help stimulate B cells to produce a more effective IgG antibody response and generate immunological memory. 

Based on this understanding, the best answer would be:

**(E) Conjugation with a protein carrier provides effective protection to infants.**

This response emphasizes the importance of enhancing the immune response in infants, which is a critical aspect of vaccine efficacy.

Question: A researcher is investigating the relationship between inflammatory mediators and omega-3 fatty acids, namely docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), in post-MI patients. IL-1ß is an important pro-inflammatory cytokine involved in fibrosis and arrhythmias in the post-MI period. Research indicates that it causes loss of function in the gap junction connexin 43 (Cx43), resulting in an arrhythmogenic state. They perform an experiment investigating the cardioprotective effect of DHA on patients after a recent MI. Their results are shown in a Western blot analysis. Which of the following is the most accurate conclusion from these results? (D) Fatty acids with double bonds in the 3rd position adjacent to the carboxy-terminus provide minimal benefits against arrhythmias after myocardial infarctions. (E) Fatty acids with double bonds in the 3rd position adjacent to the terminal carbon provide minimal benefits against arrhythmias after myocardial infarctions. (C) Fatty acids with 3 cis-double bonds provide minimal benefits against arrhythmias after myocardial infarctions. (B) Fatty acids with double bonds in the 3rd position adjacent to the terminal carbon are cardioprotective against the effects of IL-1β in post-MI cells. (A) Fatty acids with double bonds in the 3rd position adjacent to the carboxy-terminus are cardioprotective against the effects of IL-1β in post-MI cells.
Reason: In this scenario, option (B) is the most accurate conclusion because it specifically identifies the configuration of the fatty acids (with double bonds in the 3rd position adjacent to the terminal carbon) that typically corresponds to the characteristics of omega-3 fatty acids like DHA and EPA. These fatty acids are well-documented for their cardioprotective effects, particularly in counteracting inflammatory processes which can lead to arrhythmias after myocardial infarction.
Answer: (B) Fatty acids with double bonds in the 3rd position adjacent to the terminal carbon are cardioprotective against the effects of IL-1β in post-MI cells.

Question: A 4-year-old girl is brought by her mother to the pediatrician for neck drainage. The mother reports that the child has always had a small pinpoint opening on the front of her neck, though the opening has never been symptomatic. The child developed a minor cold approximately 10 days ago which resolved after a week. However, over the past 2 days, the mother has noticed clear thick drainage from the opening on the child’s neck. The child is otherwise healthy. She had an uncomplicated birth and is currently in the 45th and 40th percentiles for height and weight, respectively. On examination, there is a small opening along the skin at the anterior border of the right sternocleidomastoid at the junction of the middle and lower thirds of the neck. There is some slight clear thick discharge from the opening. Palpation around the opening elicits a cough from the child. This patient’s condition is caused by tissue that also forms which of the following? (B) Inferior parathyroid glands (C) Superior parathyroid glands (E) Epithelial tonsillar lining (A) Epithelial lining of the Eustachian tube (D) Thymus gland
Reason: The correct answer is (E) Epithelial tonsillar lining because the described condition appears to be a branchial cleft cyst, which arises from the remnants of the branchial apparatus during embryonic development. The branchial apparatus is closely associated with the development of the tonsils, and thus the epithelial origins align with the epithelial lining of the tonsillar tissue. The presentation of a neck opening with drainage that elicits a cough upon palpation supports the diagnosis of this type of cyst, as it can be related to the structures involving the tonsillar region.
Answer: (E) Epithelial tonsillar lining

Question: A previously healthy 2-month-old girl is brought to the emergency department because her lips turned blue while passing stools 30 minutes ago. She is at the 40th percentile for length and below the 35th percentile for weight. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 65%, which increases to 76% on administration of 100% oxygen. Physical examination shows perioral cyanosis and retractions of the lower ribs with respiration. Cardiac examination shows a harsh grade 2/6 systolic crescendo-decrescendo murmur heard best at the left upper sternal border. Which of the following is most likely to improve this patient's symptoms? (E) Knee to chest positioning (B) Elevation of the lower extremities (D) Hyperextension of the neck (A) Cooling of the face (C) Administration of indomethacin
Reason: The correct answer is (E) Knee to chest positioning because this maneuver increases systemic vascular resistance, which can help to redirect blood flow from right-to-left shunting through a potential cardiac defect, such as in the case of a Tetralogy of Fallot or a similar condition. This positioning effectively reduces the severity of cyanotic spells, as it can increase pulmonary blood flow to improve oxygenation and relieve symptoms associated with right-to-left shunting during episodes of cyanosis.
Answer: (E) Knee to chest positioning

Question: A 78-year-old man with a history of myocardial infarction status post coronary artery bypass grafting and a 60-pack-year history of smoking is found deceased in his apartment after not returning calls to his family for the last 2 days. The man was last known to be alive 3 days ago, when his neighbor saw him getting his mail. The family requests an autopsy. On autopsy, the man is found to have a 100% blockage of his left anterior descending artery of his heart and likely passed from sudden cardiac death 2 days prior. Which of the following findings is expected to be found on histologic examination of his damaged myocardium? (B) Cellular debris and macrophages (C) Cystic cavitation (E) Uniform binding of acidophilic dyes (D) Fat saponification (A) Cellular debris and lymphocytes
Reason: The expected finding on histologic examination of the damaged myocardium in this case is uniform binding of acidophilic dyes, indicating coagulative necrosis. This type of necrosis is typically seen in cases of myocardial infarction, where the heart tissue undergoes ischemic damage due to blockage of the coronary arteries, leading to a characteristic histological appearance that shows an absence of nuclear detail and maintains the overall tissue architecture.

Further evaluation of this patient is likely to show which of the following laboratory findings?
Serum osmolality Urine osmolality Urinary sodium excretion
(A) 220 mOsm/kg H2O 130 mOsm/kg H2O 10 mEq/L
(B) 269 mOsm/kg H2O 269 mOsm/kg H2O 82 mEq/L
(C) 255 mOsm/kg H2O 45 mOsm/kg H2O 12 mEq/L
(D) 222 mOsm/kg H2O 490 mOsm/kg H2O 10 mEq/L
(E) 310 mOsm/kg H2O 420 mOsm/kg H2O 16 mEq/L" (A) (A) (B) (B) (E) (E)
" (C) (C) (D) (D)
Reason: The correct answer is (B) 269 mOsm/kg H2O for serum osmolality, 269 mOsm/kg H2O for urine osmolality, and 82 mEq/L for urinary sodium excretion. 

The rationale behind this choice involves understanding the patient's clinical presentation, particularly the hyponatremia (serum sodium of 125 mEq/L) likely due to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), which is common in patients with small cell lung cancer. Accordingly, in SIADH, both serum and urine osmolality are typically similarly low due to excess water retention despite low serum sodium, leading to a urine sodium excretion that is often inappropriately high (in this case, 82 mEq/L).
Answer: (B) (B)

Question: A 54-year-old man is brought to the physician by his wife because of progressive difficulty walking during the past 3 months. He has not been able to walk without assistance for the past month and has started to use a wheelchair. He also reports having urinary incontinence for 1 year. His wife says that he has begun to slur his words and has become very difficult to understand. His temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 70/min, and respirations are 16/min. His blood pressure is 130/80mm Hg while sitting and 110/65mm Hg when standing. He is oriented to person and place but not to time. Neurological examination shows a mild tremor in his right hand and rigidity in his upper and lower extremities. He is unable to perform repetitive rotary forearm movements. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? (D) Corticobasal degeneration (A) Multiple system atrophy (E) Normal pressure hydrocephalus (C) Friedreich ataxia (B) Parkinson disease
Reason: The correct answer is (A) Multiple system atrophy (MSA). 

The reasoning behind this diagnosis lies in the combination of symptoms the patient exhibits. MSA typically presents with a combination of parkinsonism (e.g., tremor, rigidity), autonomic dysfunction (e.g., orthostatic hypotension indicated by a drop in blood pressure upon standing), and urinary incontinence. The onset of difficulty with walking, slurred speech, and the inability to perform repetitive movements further supports MSA, especially when considered alongside the patient's age and the presence of both motor and autonomic symptoms.

Answer: (A) Multiple system atrophy

Question: A newborn female is found to have ambiguous genitalia and hypotension. Laboratory workup reveals hyperkalemia, hyperreninemia, and elevated levels of 17-hydroxyprogesterone in the patient's urine. Which of the following enzymes would you expect to be deficient in this patient? (B) DHT (C) 17-hydroxylase (E) 11-hydroxylase (A) Angiotensin II (D) 21-hydroxylase
Reason: The correct answer is (D) 21-hydroxylase. 

The reasoning behind this choice is based on the presentation of the newborn with ambiguous genitalia, hypotension, hyperkalemia, hyperreninemia, and elevated levels of 17-hydroxyprogesterone. This clinical picture is characteristic of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency, where the impaired conversion of 17-hydroxyprogesterone to cortisol leads to an accumulation of steroids, resulting in virilization and adrenal crisis symptoms such as hypotension and hyperkalemia.
Answer: (D) 21-hydroxylase

Question: A 30-year-old computer scientist receives negative feedback on a recent project from his senior associate. He is told sternly that he must improve his performance on the next project. Later that day, he yells at his intern, a college student, for not showing enough initiative, though he had voiced only satisfaction with his performance up until this point. Which of the following psychological defense mechanisms is he demonstrating? (B) Displacement (D) Acting out (E) Transference (A) Projection (C) Countertransference
Reason: Displacement is a defense mechanism where an individual redirects feelings of frustration or anger from one source to a different, less threatening target. In this scenario, the computer scientist's frustration about his senior associate's feedback is displaced onto the intern, who is not the real source of his anger, which aligns with the definition of displacement.

Question: A 25-year-old G1P0000 presents to her obstetrician’s office for a routine prenatal visit at 32 weeks gestation. At this visit, she feels well and has no complaints. Her pregnancy has been uncomplicated, aside from her Rh negative status, for which she received Rhogam at 28 weeks gestation. The patient has a past medical history of mild intermittent asthma and migraine headaches. She currently uses her albuterol inhaler once a week and takes a prenatal vitamin. Her temperature is 98.6°F (37.0°C), pulse is 70/min, blood pressure is 117/68 mmHg, and respirations are 13/min. Cardiopulmonary exam is unremarkable, and abdominal exam reveals a gravid uterus with fundal height at 30 centimeters. Bedside ultrasound reveals that the fetus is in transverse lie. The patient states that she prefers to have a vaginal delivery. Which of the following is the best next step in management? (C) External cephalic version (D) Internal cephalic version (B) Weekly ultrasound (E) Caesarean section at 38 weeks (A) Expectant management
Reason: Expectant management is appropriate in this situation because the fetus is only 32 weeks gestation and still has time to turn into a vertical position on its own. As most fetuses will naturally resolve to a favorable position for delivery as the pregnancy progresses, it is standard to monitor the situation without immediate intervention unless complications arise.
Answer: (A) Expectant management

Question: A 24-year-old woman presents to the clinic with chronic abdominal discomfort and cramping. She seeks medical attention now as she is concerned about the diarrhea that she has developed that is occasionally mixed with tiny streaks of blood. Her medical history is significant for lactose intolerance and asthma. She has a family history of wheat allergy and reports that she has tried to make herself vomit on several occasions to lose weight. After counseling the patient about the dangers of bulimia, physical examination reveals the rectum is red, inflamed, tender, and a perirectal abscess is seen draining purulent material. Colonoscopy demonstrates scattered mucosal lesions involving the colon and terminal ileum. A complete blood count is given below:
Hb%:   10 gm/dL
Total count (WBC):   12,500/mm3
Differential count:    
  Neutrophils: 50%
  Lymphocytes: 40%
  Monocytes: 5%
ESR:   22 mm/hr
What is the most likely diagnosis? (E) Laxative abuse (C) Ulcerative colitis (D) Crohn’s disease (A) Irritable bowel syndrome (B) Celiac disease
Reason: Crohn’s disease is characterized by chronic gastrointestinal symptoms, such as abdominal discomfort, diarrhea with blood, and inflamed mucosal lesions, which match this patient's presentation. The involvement of both the colon and terminal ileum, along with the evidence of inflammation indicated by elevated white blood cell counts and the presence of a perirectal abscess, supports the diagnosis of Crohn’s disease over other conditions such as ulcerative colitis or irritable bowel syndrome.
Answer: (D) Crohn’s disease

Question: A 4-year-old girl is brought to the physician for a painless lump on her neck. She has no history of serious illness and her vital signs are within normal limits. On examination, there is a firm, 2-cm swelling at the midline just below the level of the hyoid bone. The mass moves cranially when she is asked to protrude her tongue. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? (B) Ranula (D) Cystic hygroma (C) Laryngocele (E) Dermoid cyst (A) Thyroglossal cyst
Reason: The most likely diagnosis is (A) Thyroglossal cyst because it is a common congenital neck mass that typically presents as a midline lump, especially in children. The characteristic movement of the swelling with tongue protrusion indicates its attachment to the thyroid gland, which develops from the thyroglossal duct; this is a hallmark feature of a thyroglossal cyst.

Question: A 32-year-old HIV positive female known to be non-adherent to her treatment regimen, presents to the hospital with the complaint of new-onset headaches. Her vital signs are only significant for a low-grade fever. Neurological examination reveals right-sided upper motor neuron signs, as well as a inattention and difficulty with concentration. The patient currently does not have a primary medical provider. A CT of the patients head is shown in the image below. What is the next best step in management for this patient? (A) Perform a biopsy of the lesion (B) Perform an analysis for 14-3-3 protein levels (E) Begin treatment with acyclovir (C) Begin treatment with pyrimethamine-sulfadiazine (D) Begin treatment with albendazole and corticosteroids
Reason: The next best step in management for this patient is (C) Begin treatment with pyrimethamine-sulfadiazine because the patient's presentation of new-onset headaches, neurological signs, and HIV positivity raises suspicion for cerebral toxoplasmosis. This infection is common in individuals with compromised immune systems, such as those with untreated HIV, and the treatment with pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine is the standard approach for managing this condition.
Answer: (C) Begin treatment with pyrimethamine-sulfadiazine

Question: A 14-year-old girl presents to her pediatrician with complaints of repeated jerking of her neck for the past 2 years. Initially, her parents considered it a sign of discomfort in her neck, but later they noticed that the jerking was more frequent when she was under emotional stress or when she was fatigued. The patient says she can voluntarily control the jerking in some social situations, but when she is under stress, she feels the urge to jerk her neck and she feels better after that. The parents also report that during the past year, there have even been a few weeks when the frequency of the neck jerking had decreased drastically, only to increase again afterwards. On physical examination, she is a physically healthy female with normal vital signs. Her neurologic examination is normal. The pediatrician also notes that when he makes certain movements, the patient partially imitates these movements. The parents are very much concerned about her abnormal movements and insist on a complete diagnostic work-up. After a detailed history, physical examination, and laboratory investigations, the pediatrician confirms the diagnosis of Tourette syndrome. The presence of which of the following findings is most likely to confirm the pediatrician’s diagnosis? (C) Low serum ceruloplasmin level (B) Rigidity and bradykinesia (E) Increased activity in frontal subcortical regions in positron-emission tomography (PET) study (D) Decreased caudate volumes in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain (A) History of repeated bouts of unprovoked obscene speech over the past year
Reason: The presence of (A) history of repeated bouts of unprovoked obscene speech over the past year is most likely to confirm the pediatrician’s diagnosis of Tourette syndrome because this condition is characterized by the presence of multiple motor and vocal tics. Uncontrolled, involuntary vocalizations, including coprolalia (obscene speech), are a hallmark feature of Tourette syndrome and help differentiate it from other movement disorders.
Answer: (A) History of repeated bouts of unprovoked obscene speech over the past year

Question: An 18-month-old boy is brought in to the pediatrician by his mother for concerns that her child is becoming more and more yellow over the past two days. She additionally states that the boy has been getting over a stomach flu and has not been able to keep down any food. The boy does not have a history of neonatal jaundice. On exam, the patient appears slightly sluggish and jaundiced with icteric sclera. His temperature is 99.0°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 88/56 mmHg, pulse is 110/min, and respirations are 22/min. His labs demonstrate an unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia of 16 mg/dL. It is determined that the best course of treatment for this patient is phenobarbital to increase liver enzyme synthesis. Which of the following best describes the molecular defect in this patient? (E) Nonsense mutation in the UGT1A1 gene (A) Deletion in the SLCO1B1 gene (D) Missense mutation in the UGT1A1 gene (C) Mutation in the promoter region of the UGT1A1 gene (B) Silent mutation in the UGT1A1 gene
Reason: The molecular defect in this patient is best described as a missense mutation in the UGT1A1 gene (D). This mutation affects the bilirubin-UDGT enzyme's ability to conjugate bilirubin, leading to the unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia observed in the patient, and the treatment with phenobarbital is intended to induce the expression of this enzyme and increase bilirubin conjugation.
Answer: (D) Missense mutation in the UGT1A1 gene

Question: A 27-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 30 minutes after being shot in the abdomen during a violent altercation. His temperature is 36.5°C (97.7°F), pulse is 118/min and regular, and blood pressure is 88/65 mm Hg. Examination shows cool extremities. Abdominal examination shows a 2.5-cm entrance wound in the left upper quadrant at the midclavicular line, below the left costal margin. Focused ultrasound shows free fluid in the left upper quadrant. Which of the following sets of hemodynamic changes is most likely in this patient?
 $$$ Cardiac output (CO) %%% Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) %%% Systemic vascular resistance (SVR) %%% Central venous pressure (CVP) $$$ (B) ↓ ↓ ↑ ↓ (A) ↑ ↓ ↓ ↓ (E) ↓ ↑ ↑ ↑ (C) ↓ ↓ ↑ ↑ (D) ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓
Reason: The most likely hemodynamic changes in this patient are a decrease in cardiac output (CO), a decrease in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), an increase in systemic vascular resistance (SVR), and a decrease in central venous pressure (CVP) (B). This clinical scenario is consistent with hemorrhagic shock due to abdominal trauma, where blood loss leads to decreased cardiac output, while compensatory mechanisms cause increased systemic vascular resistance to maintain blood pressure, resulting in cool extremities and signs of shock.

Question: A 34-year-old man presents to the outpatient clinic with a complaint of right-sided jaw pain. The onset of pain was approx. 1 month ago and he is experiencing symptoms 2–3 times a day. Each episode of pain lasts for about 30 seconds. He describes the pain as severe (9 out of 10) with an electric and sharp quality. He denies having tear production or conjunctival injection on the affected side during attacks. What is the mechanism of action for the drug that will best treat this patient’s condition? (C) Increase the frequency of Cl- channel opening (B) Decrease the excitatory effects of glutamic acid (A) Prevention of Na+ influx (E) Decrease in the Ca2+ influx (D) Increase the time of Cl- channel opening
Reason: The patient's symptoms are consistent with trigeminal neuralgia, which often presents as recurrent, severe facial pain. The best treatment for this condition typically involves anticonvulsant medications, such as carbamazepine, which work by preventing sodium (Na+) influx into neurons, thereby stabilizing the neuronal membrane and reducing the frequency and intensity of pain episodes. This mechanism is crucial in addressing the hyperexcitability of the trigeminal nerve associated with trigeminal neuralgia.

Question: A 61-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with bloody vomiting for the last hour. She had been vomiting for several hours. Additionally, she states she felt a sudden onset of chest and epigastric pain when she noted blood in her vomit. In the emergency room, she endorses feeling lightheaded and denies difficulty breathing or coughing, and the pain is not worse with swallowing. On review of systems, she notes that she has been bruising more easily than usual over the last 3 months. The patient has a long history of alcoholism with recent progression of liver disease to cirrhosis. She has known esophageal varices and is on propranolol for prophylaxis. In the emergency room, the patient’s temperature is 98.2°F (36.8°C), blood pressure is 94/60 mmHg, pulse is 103/min, and respirations are 16/min. On exam, she is in moderate distress, and there is frank blood in her emesis basin. Cardiovascular and lung exams are unremarkable, and there is pain on palpation of her epigastrium and chest without crepitus. Initial labs are shown below:

Hemoglobin: 13.1 g/dL
Leukocyte count: 6,200/mm^3
Platelet count: 220,000/mm^3
Creatinine: 0.9 mg/dL

The patient is started on IV isotonic saline, pantoprazole, ceftriaxone, and octreotide. Which of the following is the best next step in management? (D) Administer a non-selective ß-blocker (E) Perform endoscopy (B) Perform transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) (A) Administer fresh frozen plasma (FFP) (C) Perform fluoroscopic esophagography
Reason: The patient presents with bloody vomiting, chest and epigastric pain, and a background of cirrhosis and known esophageal varices, which indicates a possible variceal hemorrhage. In such cases, urgent endoscopy is the preferred management step to directly identify and potentially treat the source of the bleeding through interventions such as band ligation or sclerotherapy, making it the most immediate and effective way to address her condition.

Question: A 49-year-old man presents to the clinic with skin lesions and chronic diarrhea. His wife also reports that he has become more irritable and forgetful in the past year. His medical history is significant for a gastroenterostomy performed 4 years ago due to gastric outlet obstruction caused by hyperplastic polyposis, which was complicated by afferent loop syndrome. He became a vegan a year ago, and currently, his diet consists of starchy foods such as potatoes, corn, and leafy vegetables. The patient’s vital signs include blood pressure 100/75 mm Hg, heart rate 55/min, respiratory rate 14/min, and temperature 36.3℃ (97.3℉). His skin is pale, dry, and thin, with areas of desquamation and redness on the sun-exposed areas. His lymph nodes are not enlarged and breath sounds are normal. The cardiac apex beat is located in the 5th left intercostal space 2 cm lateral to the midclavicular line. Heart sounds are diminished and S3 is present. His abdomen is slightly distended and nontender to palpation. The liver and spleen are not enlarged. Neurologic examination reveals symmetrical hypesthesia for all types of sensation in both upper and lower extremities in a 'gloves and socks' distribution. On a mini-mental status examination, the patient scores 25 out of 30. Production of which substance is most likely to be impaired in this patient? (B) Coenzyme Q10 (D) Biotin (E) NAD+ (A) Menaquinone (C) Flavin mononucleotide
Reason: The patient's symptoms, including skin lesions, chronic diarrhea, irritability, forgetfulness, and the history of gastroenterostomy, suggest malabsorption possibly leading to deficiencies in essential nutrients. Given the background of an altered diet (vegan) and the gastrointestinal surgery, it is likely that vitamin B12 absorption is impaired, which is essential for the synthesis of NAD+. A deficiency in vitamin B12 could lead to neurological and hematological issues, correlating with the patient’s presenting symptoms and leading to reduced production of NAD+.

Question: In an experiment, a certain gene product is known to stimulate the production of a particular hormone synthesized in the liver. This hormone, when present in increased amounts, downregulates the expression of a divalent cation transmembrane transporter located on the basolateral membranes of enterocytes. Mutations in the gene product have been linked to certain abnormalities in affected patients. Such individuals may present with darkening of the skin, cold intolerance, excessive urination, and weight loss. Patients may also present with symptoms of a cardiovascular disease as a result of this disease. Which of the following would be the first cardiac finding in affected patients? (D) Preload: decreased, cardiac contractility: unchanged, afterload: increased (A) Preload: increased, cardiac contractility: decreased, afterload: increased (E) Preload: increased, cardiac contractility: increased, afterload: decreased (B) Preload: decreased, cardiac contractility: decreased, afterload: decreased (C) Preload: increased, cardiac contractility: increased, afterload: increased
Reason: The symptoms described, including darkening of the skin and excessive urination, suggest a condition related to hormonal imbalances, potentially affecting fluid balance and leading to decreased preload due to reduced venous return to the heart. In this context, a decreased preload would likely be the first cardiac finding, while the contractility remains unchanged and afterload may be increased due to compensatory mechanisms or underlying vascular resistance.
Answer: (D) Preload: decreased, cardiac contractility: unchanged, afterload: increased

Question: A 20-year-old woman reports to student health complaining of 5 days of viral symptoms including sneezing and a runny nose. She started coughing 2 days ago and is seeking cough medication. She additionally mentions that she developed a fever 2 days ago, but this has resolved. On exam, her temperature is 99.0°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 118/76 mmHg, pulse is 86/min, and respirations are 12/min. Changes in the activity of warm-sensitive neurons in which part of her hypothalamus likely contributed to the development and resolution of her fever? (E) Suprachiasmatic nucleus (D) Posterior hypothalamus (A) Anterior hypothalamus (C) Paraventricular nucleus (B) Lateral area
Reason: The anterior hypothalamus is known to play a crucial role in thermoregulation, particularly in response to pyrogens that induce fever. During the febrile response, warm-sensitive neurons in this area sense increased body temperature, and after the resolution of fever, they help signal the body to return to normal temperature, explaining the changes in activity leading to the development and subsequent resolution of her fever.
Answer: (A) Anterior hypothalamus

[INFO] Opinion paths:
Path 1: Let's analyze the options step by step.

The patient has a history of poorly controlled hypertension and is already taking enalapril (an ACE inhibitor) and metformin (for diabetes). After adding a new anti-hypertensive medication, the patient returns with new-onset lower extremity swelling.

1. **Metoprolol (A)**: This is a beta-blocker that can be used for hypertension. It is not commonly associated with lower extremity swelling.

2. **Verapamil (B)**: This is a calcium channel blocker that can also treat hypertension. It can cause peripheral edema, but it is less common compared to other calcium channel blockers.

3. **Nifedipine (C)**: This is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker that is frequently used for hypertension and is well-known for causing peripheral edema as a side effect.

4. **Hydrochlorothiazide (D)**: This is a thiazide diuretic used for hypertension. It typically does not cause lower extremity swelling; rather, it can help reduce edema.

5. **Spironolactone (E)**: This is a potassium-sparing diuretic that is sometimes used for hypertension. It can cause some mild swelling but is not as commonly associated with significant peripheral edema as calcium channel blockers.

Given that the patient developed new onset lower extremity swelling after the addition of a medication, the most likely medication prescribed that could cause this side effect is:

**Answer: (C) Nifedipine.**
Path 2: Let's analyze the situation step by step.

1. The patient has poorly controlled hypertension and was prescribed an additional antihypertensive medication.
2. After one month, he returns with new onset lower extremity swelling.

Now, let's consider the options:

(A) Metoprolol - This is a beta-blocker primarily used for hypertension and heart conditions. It typically does not cause peripheral edema.

(B) Verapamil - This is a calcium channel blocker, but it is more commonly associated with constipation and does not typically cause significant peripheral edema.

(C) Nifedipine - This is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker that is well-known for causing peripheral edema due to its vasodilatory effects, particularly in the lower extremities.

(D) Hydrochlorothiazide - This is a thiazide diuretic that can lead to depletion of volume and might cause some electrolyte imbalances, but it is not typically associated with peripheral edema.

(E) Spironolactone - This is a potassium-sparing diuretic that can cause some fluid retention but is not a common cause of peripheral edema.

Given the information, the most likely medication prescribed that would result in new onset lower extremity swelling is:

Answer: (C) Nifedipine
Path 3: Let's analyze the situation step by step. 

The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of diabetes and poorly controlled hypertension. His blood pressure is elevated (155/90 mmHg), and he is already on enalapril (an ACE inhibitor) and metformin (for diabetes). The physician adds another antihypertensive medication, and the patient returns with new onset lower extremity swelling.

Lower extremity swelling (edema) is a common side effect of certain antihypertensive medications, particularly those that are calcium channel blockers (CCBs) or certain diuretics. 

Let's evaluate the options:

(A) **Metoprolol** - This is a beta-blocker, which generally does not cause peripheral edema.

(B) **Verapamil** - This is a calcium channel blocker but is less commonly associated with peripheral edema compared to others.

(C) **Nifedipine** - This is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker and is well-known to cause peripheral edema as a side effect due to vasodilation and increased capillary permeability.

(D) **Hydrochlorothiazide** - This is a thiazide diuretic, which typically does not cause peripheral edema and is more likely to cause dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.

(E) **Spironolactone** - This is a potassium-sparing diuretic and is also not commonly associated with peripheral edema.

Considering that the patient developed new onset lower extremity swelling after starting a new antihypertensive medication, the most likely medication that would cause this side effect is **Nifedipine**.

Therefore, the answer is:
**(C) Nifedipine**
Path 4: Let's analyze the situation step by step. The patient already has hypertension and is on enalapril (an ACE inhibitor) and metformin (for diabetes). His blood pressure remains elevated at 155/90 mmHg, prompting the physician to add another antihypertensive medication.

The new onset of lower extremity swelling one month after the addition of the new medication suggests that the patient may be experiencing peripheral edema, which is a common side effect of certain antihypertensive drugs.

Now, let's consider the options:

(A) Metoprolol - This is a beta-blocker, which typically does not cause lower extremity swelling.

(B) Verapamil - This is a calcium channel blocker, but it is more often associated with constipation rather than swelling.

(C) Nifedipine - This is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, which is known to cause peripheral edema as a side effect.

(D) Hydrochlorothiazide - This is a thiazide diuretic, which usually does not cause peripheral edema; it may even alleviate it by promoting diuresis.

(E) Spironolactone - This is a potassium-sparing diuretic, which can cause some fluid retention but is less commonly associated with significant lower extremity swelling compared to calcium channel blockers.

Given that the new medication is likely to cause the symptom of lower extremity swelling, the most probable choice is:

(C) Nifedipine.
Path 5: Let's analyze the situation step by step.

The patient is a 45-year-old male with poorly controlled hypertension and is already on enalapril (an ACE inhibitor) and metformin (for diabetes). After his check-up, the physician adds another anti-hypertensive medication. One month later, the patient returns with new onset lower extremity swelling.

Among the options given:

(A) Metoprolol - This is a beta-blocker that typically does not cause peripheral edema.

(B) Verapamil - This is a calcium channel blocker, but it is more commonly associated with constipation rather than peripheral edema.

(C) Nifedipine - This is also a calcium channel blocker, particularly a dihydropyridine, which is known to cause peripheral edema as a side effect due to peripheral vasodilation.

(D) Hydrochlorothiazide - This is a thiazide diuretic that can also cause electrolyte imbalances but is less commonly associated with peripheral edema.

(E) Spironolactone - This is a potassium-sparing diuretic that can cause some fluid retention but is less likely to cause significant peripheral edema compared to calcium channel blockers.

Given that the new onset of lower extremity swelling is a common side effect of certain antihypertensive medications, the most likely medication added to this patient's regimen that would cause such swelling is (C) Nifedipine.

Therefore, the answer is (C) Nifedipine.
Path 6: Let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. **Patient's Profile**: The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of diabetes and poorly controlled hypertension. He is currently on enalapril (an ACE inhibitor) and metformin (for diabetes).

2. **New Symptoms**: After the addition of a new antihypertensive medication, the patient develops lower extremity swelling.

3. **Possible Side Effects**: It is important to consider which antihypertensive medications are known to cause peripheral edema. 

   - **Metoprolol** (A): A beta-blocker that can cause some fluid retention but is less likely to cause significant lower extremity swelling.
   - **Verapamil** (B): A calcium channel blocker that can cause constipation and some peripheral edema but is not as commonly associated with significant swelling.
   - **Nifedipine** (C): A dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker that is known to commonly cause peripheral edema due to its vasodilatory effects.
   - **Hydrochlorothiazide** (D): A thiazide diuretic that typically causes increased urination and fluid loss, rather than swelling.
   - **Spironolactone** (E): A potassium-sparing diuretic that can cause some fluid retention but is primarily used for its diuretic properties and does not typically cause lower extremity swelling.

4. **Most Likely Medication**: Given that the patient developed new onset lower extremity swelling after adding a medication, the most likely drug prescribed is **Nifedipine**, as it is known for causing peripheral edema due to its vasodilatory effects.

Answer: (C) Nifedipine
Path 7: Let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. **Patient's Background**: The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of diabetes and poorly controlled hypertension. He is currently taking enalapril (an ACE inhibitor) and metformin (for diabetes).

2. **New Medication**: The physician adds another antihypertensive medication to help control the patient's high blood pressure, which is 155/90 mmHg.

3. **Follow-Up**: When the patient returns after one month, he reports new-onset lower extremity swelling. 

4. **Medication Side Effects**: 
   - **Metoprolol (A)**: A beta-blocker that typically does not cause peripheral edema.
   - **Verapamil (B)**: A calcium channel blocker that can cause constipation but is less commonly associated with edema.
   - **Nifedipine (C)**: A calcium channel blocker that is known to cause peripheral edema due to vasodilation.
   - **Hydrochlorthiazide (D)**: A thiazide diuretic that usually helps reduce fluid retention, so it is unlikely to cause swelling.
   - **Spironolactone (E)**: A potassium-sparing diuretic that can cause some fluid retention, but it is more commonly associated with gynecomastia and hyperkalemia rather than peripheral edema.

5. **Conclusion**: Given the patient's new symptom of lower extremity swelling and the mechanism of the medications considered, the most likely medication that was prescribed, which is associated with peripheral edema, is **Nifedipine (C)**.

Answer: (C) Nifedipine
Path 8: Let's think step by step. The patient has poorly controlled hypertension and is being treated with enalapril (an ACE inhibitor) and metformin for diabetes. One month later, he presents with new onset lower extremity swelling, which suggests fluid retention as a side effect of the added antihypertensive medication.

Among the options provided:

(A) Metoprolol - a beta-blocker, typically does not cause significant fluid retention.
(B) Verapamil - a calcium channel blocker that can cause some peripheral edema but is less common than other options.
(C) Nifedipine - a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker that is known to cause peripheral edema as a side effect due to vasodilation.
(D) Hydrochlorothiazide - a thiazide diuretic that typically causes diuresis, not fluid retention.
(E) Spironolactone - a potassium-sparing diuretic that can lead to some fluid retention but is more associated with electrolyte imbalances.

Given that the patient has developed lower extremity swelling, the most likely medication added to his regimen that could cause this side effect is **(C) Nifedipine**. 

So the answer is: **(C) Nifedipine**.
Path 9: Let's think step by step. Reason: The patient has poorly controlled hypertension, and a common class of antihypertensive medications that can cause lower extremity swelling (peripheral edema) as a side effect are calcium channel blockers. Among the options provided, both nifedipine and verapamil are calcium channel blockers, but nifedipine, particularly in its extended-release form, is often associated with peripheral edema due to its vasodilatory effects. 

Given the context of new onset lower extremity swelling after the addition of a new antihypertensive medication, the most likely medication prescribed would be **(C) Nifedipine**.
Path 10: To determine which medication was likely prescribed, let's analyze the options and the patient's new symptom of lower extremity swelling.

1. **Metoprolol (A)**: This is a beta-blocker that primarily helps in lowering blood pressure and would not typically cause lower extremity swelling.

2. **Verapamil (B)**: This is a calcium channel blocker that can cause lower extremity swelling but is usually less associated with peripheral edema compared to dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers.

3. **Nifedipine (C)**: This is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker that is well known to cause peripheral edema (swelling of the lower extremities) as a side effect due to vasodilation and increased capillary permeability.

4. **Hydrochlorothiazide (D)**: This is a thiazide diuretic that is more likely to cause electrolyte imbalances but is not typically associated with causing peripheral edema.

5. **Spironolactone (E)**: This is a potassium-sparing diuretic that is less likely to cause lower extremity swelling and is more associated with other electrolyte issues.

Considering the symptom of lower extremity swelling, the medication that is most likely to cause this side effect after being added to the regimen would be **Nifedipine (C)**.

So, the answer is: **(C) Nifedipine**.

Question: A 14-year-old boy presents to the emergency department with an intractable nosebleed. Pinching of the nose has failed to stop the bleed. The patient is otherwise healthy and has no history of trauma or hereditary bleeding disorders. His temperature is 98.9°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 120/64 mmHg, pulse is 85/min, respirations are 12/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for multiple clots in the nares which, when dislodged, are followed by bleeding. Which of the following location is the most likely etiology of this patient's symptoms? (C) Kiesselbach plexus (D) Septal hematoma (E) Sphenopalatine artery (A) Carotid artery (B) Ethmoidal artery
Reason: The patient's presentation of an intractable nosebleed, particularly in the absence of trauma or bleeding disorders, suggests a common source of epistaxis. The Kiesselbach plexus is well-known as a frequent site for anterior nosebleeds in adolescents, making it the most likely etiology in this case.

Question: A cross-sectional study of 650 patients with confirmed bronchogenic carcinoma was conducted in patients of all age groups in order to establish a baseline picture for further mortality comparisons. All patients were investigated using thoracic ultrasound and computed tomography of the chest. Also, data about the size of the mass, invasion of lymph nodes and chest wall, pleural effusion, and eventual paralysis of the diaphragm were noted. The bias that can arise in this case, and that may hamper further conclusions on the aggressiveness and mortality of bronchogenic carcinoma, may be explained as a tendency to which of the following aspects? (E) Identify more instances of fatal disease (A) Find more cases of the disease in older cohorts (B) Observe only the late stages of a disease with more severe manifestations (C) Detect only asymptomatic cases of the disease (D) Uncover more indolent cases of the disease preferentially
Reason: In a cross-sectional study design, participants are assessed at a single point in time, which may lead to the selection of cases that do not represent the more aggressive forms of bronchogenic carcinoma. This could result in a bias toward identifying indolent cases, since patients with more severe manifestations may have already succumbed to the disease, thereby skewing the results toward a less aggressive picture of the cancer's overall mortality and progression.
Answer: (D) Uncover more indolent cases of the disease preferentially

Question: A 72-year-old man presents to the ED complaining of worsening abdominal pain over the last few hours. He also reports nausea, but denies fever, vomiting, or changes in the appearance of his bowel movements. His medical history is significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease, stroke, atrial fibrillation, and peptic ulcer disease. Due to his recurrent bleeding peptic ulcers, he does not take warfarin. His surgical history is significant for an appendectomy as a child. His medications include metformin, lisinopril, metoprolol, and omeprazole. He has a 50-pack-year history of smoking. His temperature is 37.6 C (99.7 F), blood pressure is 146/80 mm Hg, pulse is 115/min, and respiratory rate is 20/min. On physical exam, he is in acute distress due to the pain. Pulmonary auscultation reveals scattered wheezes and decreased air entry. His heart rate is irregularly irregular, with no murmurs, rubs or gallops. Abdominal exam is significant for decreased bowel sounds and diffuse tenderness. Initial laboratory evaluation is as follows:
Na 138 mEq/L, Cl 101 mEq/L, HCO3 12 mEq/L, BUN 21 mg/dL, Cr 0.9 mg/dL, glucose 190 mg/dL, amylase 240 U/L (normal < 65 U/L).
What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient? (E) Acute pancreatitis (C) Acute mesenteric ischemia (A) Peptic ulcer perforation (B) Acute cholecystitis (D) Diabetic ketoacidosis
Reason: Acute mesenteric ischemia is the most likely diagnosis in this patient due to his acute abdominal pain, decreased bowel sounds, and high amylase level, which suggests gastrointestinal distress. Additionally, his history of atrial fibrillation increases the risk of embolic events that could lead to mesenteric ischemia, especially given his age and other cardiovascular risk factors.
Answer: (C) Acute mesenteric ischemia

Question: A newborn male is evaluated in the hospital nursery 24 hours after birth for cyanosis. The patient was born at 38 weeks gestation to a 36-year-old gravida 3 via cesarean section for fetal distress. The patient’s mother received inconsistent prenatal care, and the delivery was uncomplicated. The patient’s Apgar evaluation was notable for acrocyanosis at both 1 and 5 minutes of life. The patient’s mother denies any family history of congenital heart disease. The patient’s father has a past medical history of hypertension, and one of the patient’s older siblings was recently diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. The patient’s birth weight was 3180 g (7 lb 0 oz). In the hospital nursery, his temperature is 99.3°F (37.4°C), blood pressure is 66/37 mmHg, pulse is 179/min, and respirations are 42/min. On physical exam, the patient is in moderate distress. He has low-set ears, orbital hypertelorism, and a cleft palate. The patient is centrally cyanotic. A chest CT shows thymic hypoplasia. Echocardiography demonstrates a single vessel emanating from both the right and left ventricle.

This patient should be urgently evaluated for which of the following acute complications? (C) Neuromuscular irritability (B) Hypoglycemia (D) Rhabdomyolysis (A) Cerebral edema (E) Shortening of the QT interval
Reason: The most appropriate answer is (C) Neuromuscular irritability because the patient's presentation suggests congenital conditions consistent with a complex cyanotic heart defect, possibly related to DiGeorge syndrome, given the thymic hypoplasia and physical anomalies such as low-set ears and cleft palate. Neuromuscular irritability is a potential complication due to hypocalcemia, which can occur in patients with this syndrome due to parathyroid gland development issues.

Question: A 37-year-old man presents to the physician because of dysphagia and regurgitation for the past 5 years. In recent weeks, it has become very difficult for him to ingest solid or liquid food. He has lost 3 kg (6 lb) during this time. He was admitted to the hospital last year because of pneumonia. Three years ago, he had an endoscopic procedure which partially improved his dysphagia. He takes amlodipine and nitroglycerine before meals. His vital signs are within normal limits. BMI is 19 kg/m2. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. A barium swallow X-ray is shown. Which of the following patterns of esophageal involvement is the most likely cause of this patient’s condition? (E) Severely weak peristalsis and patulous lower esophageal sphincter (D) Sequenced inhibition followed by contraction of the musculature along the esophagus (B) Absent peristalsis and impaired lower esophageal sphincter relaxation (A) Abnormal esophageal contraction with deglutition lower esophageal sphincter relaxation (C) Poor pharyngeal propulsion and upper esophageal sphincter obstruction
Reason: This patient's symptoms, including progressive dysphagia and regurgitation, along with his history of pneumonia and weight loss, suggest a significant esophageal motility disorder. The description of "absent peristalsis and impaired lower esophageal sphincter relaxation" aligns with conditions such as achalasia, where the esophagus fails to propel food effectively and the lower esophageal sphincter does not open properly during swallowing, leading to the symptoms he is experiencing.
Answer: (B) Absent peristalsis and impaired lower esophageal sphincter relaxation

Question: A 46-year-old woman presents to the emergency department complaining of bloody diarrhea, fatigue, and confusion. A few days earlier she went to a fast-food restaurant for a college reunion party. Her friends are experiencing similar symptoms. Laboratory tests show anemia, thrombocytopenia, and uremia. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is raised while haptoglobin is decreased. Peripheral blood smears show fragmented red blood cells (RBCs). Coombs tests are negative. Which of the following is the responsible organism? (A) Entamoeba histolytica (D) Shigella (B) E. coli (E) Salmonella (C) Campylobacter jejuni
Reason: The patient's presentation, including bloody diarrhea, fatigue, and signs of hemolytic anemia (elevated LDH, decreased haptoglobin, and fragmented RBCs), suggests a diagnosis of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), which is commonly associated with infection by enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC), specifically O157:H7. The rapid onset of symptoms in multiple individuals following a meal at a fast-food restaurant points towards a foodborne outbreak linked to E. coli as the responsible organism.

Question: A 28-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of increasing abdominal pain for 2 days. The pain is diffuse and constant, and she describes it as 7 out of 10 in intensity. She has also had numbness in her lower extremities for 12 hours. She has type 1 diabetes mellitus, migraine with aura, and essential tremor. She appears uncomfortable. She is oriented to place and person only. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 123/min, and blood pressure is 140/70 mm Hg. Examination shows a distended abdomen with no tenderness to palpation. Bowel sounds are decreased. Muscle strength and sensation is decreased in the lower extremities. There is a tremor of the right upper extremity. Urinalysis shows elevated levels of aminolevulinic acid and porphobilinogen. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms? (D) Metoclopramide (B) Amitriptyline (C) Flunarizine (A) Primidone (E) Sumatriptan
Reason: The likely cause of this patient's symptoms is associated with Primidone, as it is a medication used to treat essential tremor and can lead to neurotoxic effects such as abdominal pain, changes in bowel function (thus the decreased bowel sounds), and neurological symptoms like lower extremity numbness and decreased strength. The presence of elevated levels of aminolevulinic acid and porphobilinogen may suggest a possible acute porphyria triggered by the use of Primidone, further supporting its role as the causative agent in this case.
Answer: (A) Primidone

Question: A 70-year-old man presents to his physician for evaluation of fullness and swelling of the left side of the abdomen over the last month. During this time, he has had night sweats and lost 2 kg (4.4 lb) unintentionally. He has no history of severe illness and takes no medications. The vital signs include: blood pressure 115/75 mm Hg, pulse 75/min, and temperature 36.8℃ (98.2℉). The abdomen has asymmetric distention. Percussion and palpation of the left upper quadrant reveal splenomegaly. No lymphadenopathy is detected. Heart and lung examination shows no abnormalities. The laboratory studies show the following:
Hemoglobin 9.5 g/dL
Mean corpuscular volume 95 μm3
Leukocyte count 8,000/mm3
Platelet count 240,000/mm3
Ultrasound shows a spleen size of 15 cm, mild hepatomegaly, and mild ascites. The peripheral blood smear shows teardrop-shaped and nucleated red blood cells (RBCs) and immature myeloid cells. Marrow is very difficult to aspirate but reveals hyperplasia of all 3 lineages. The tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) test is negative. The cytogenetic analysis is negative for translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22. Which of the following laboratory findings is most likely to be present in this patient? (A) Monoclonal elevation of IgG (C) JAK-2 mutation (B) Hair-like cell-membrane projections (D) Philadelphia chromosome (E) Reed-Sternburg cells
Reason: This patient likely has myelofibrosis or another myeloproliferative neoplasm, as indicated by the splenomegaly, teardrop-shaped red blood cells, and difficulty in aspirating marrow. The presence of a JAK2 mutation is commonly associated with these conditions, which explains the hematological abnormalities observed in this patient and their potential for splenomegaly and other systemic symptoms.

Question: A 69-year-old man with aggressive metastatic cholangiocarcinoma presents after the second round of chemotherapy. He has suffered a great deal of pain from the metastasis to his spine, and he is experiencing side effects from the cytotoxic chemotherapy drugs. Imaging shows no change in the tumor mass and reveals the presence of several new metastatic lesions. The patient is not willing to undergo any more chemotherapy unless he gets something for pain that will “knock him out”. High-dose opioids would be effective, in his case, but carry a risk of bradypnea and sudden respiratory failure. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? (B) Give a lower dose even though it has less efficacy (C) Continue another round of chemotherapy without opioids (E) Put him in a medically-induced coma during chemotherapy sessions (A) Give the high-dose opioids (D) Stop chemotherapy
Reason: The choice to give high-dose opioids is based on the need for effective pain management in a patient with advanced cancer and significant metastatic disease. While there are risks associated with high doses, controlling severe pain is essential for quality of life, especially when the patient is not willing to continue chemotherapy without adequate analgesia. Therefore, addressing the patient’s immediate pain needs takes precedence in this scenario.
Answer: (A) Give the high-dose opioids

Question: A 38-year-old woman is diagnosed with a stage IIIa infiltrating ductal carcinoma involving the left breast. The tumor is ER/PR positive, HER-2 negative, poorly differentiated Bloom-Richardson grade 3. 4/20 regional nodes are positive. The patient undergoes a lumpectomy with axillary lymph node dissection, followed by chemotherapy and radiation therapy to the left breast and axilla. Her chemotherapy regimen involves doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and paclitaxel. Following completion of the intensive phase, she is started on tamoxifen as an adjuvant therapy. 6 months later, she presents with increasing fatigue, orthopnea, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. Physical examination reveals the presence of an S3 gallop, jugular venous distension (JVD), pedal edema, and ascites. She is diagnosed with congestive cardiac failure and admitted for further management. An echocardiogram confirms the diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy with severe diastolic dysfunction and an ejection fraction of 10%. Her medical history prior to the diagnosis of breast cancer is negative for any cardiac conditions. The baseline echocardiogram prior to starting chemotherapy and a 12-lead electrocardiogram were normal. Which of the following is most likely responsible for her current cardiac condition? (E) Myocarditis (C) Tamoxifen (B) Radiation therapy (D) Cyclophosphamide (A) Doxorubicin
Reason: The correct answer is attributed to doxorubicin, as it is well-known for its cardiotoxic effects, particularly leading to conditions such as dilated cardiomyopathy. This patient’s history and the timing of her symptoms—developing heart failure after receiving a chemotherapy regimen that included doxorubicin—supports the likelihood that it is the primary cause of her cardiac condition.
Answer: (A) Doxorubicin

Question: A 59-year-old man with angina pectoris comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of shortness of breath on exertion that improves with rest. He has hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Current medications include aspirin, metoprolol, and nitroglycerine. Echocardiography shows left ventricular septal and apical hypokinesis. Cardiac catheterization shows 96% occlusion of the left anterior descending artery. The patient undergoes angioplasty and placement of a stent. The patient's shortness of breath subsequently resolves and follow-up echocardiography one week later shows normal regional contractile function. Which of the following is the most accurate explanation for the changes in echocardiography? (A) Unstable angina pectoris (B) Stress cardiomyopathy (D) Myocardial scarring (C) Hibernating myocardium (E) Cardiac remodeling
Reason: The explanation for the changes in echocardiography is attributed to hibernating myocardium, which refers to myocardial tissue that is viable but exhibits reduced function due to chronic ischemia. After revascularization through angioplasty and stenting, blood flow is restored to the affected area, allowing the previously hypokinetic segments of the heart to regain normal contractile function, as observed in the follow-up echocardiogram.
Answer: (C) Hibernating myocardium

Question: A 64-year-old homeless man comes to the emergency department with right ear pain and difficulty hearing for 2 weeks. Over the last 5 days, he has also noticed discharge from his right ear. He does not recall the last time he saw a physician. His temperature is 39.0°C (102.2°F), blood pressure is 153/92 mm Hg, pulse is 113/minute, and respirations are 18/minute. He appears dirty and is malodorous. Physical examination shows mild facial asymmetry with the right corner of his mouth lagging behind the left when the patient smiles. He experiences severe ear pain when the right auricle is pulled superiorly. On otoscopic examination, there is granulation tissue at the transition between the cartilaginous and the osseous part of the ear canal. Which of the following is most likely associated with this patient's condition? (A) Malignant epithelial growth of the external auditory canal (C) Opacified mastoid air cells (E) Elevated HBA1c (B) Condylar degeneration (D) Streptococcus pneumoniae
Reason: The patient's symptoms, which include ear pain, discharge, facial asymmetry, and signs of possible infection, suggest a chronic condition that could be complicated by systemic issues like diabetes. Elevated HbA1c levels are indicative of poorly controlled diabetes, which can predispose individuals to infections, delayed healing, and contribute to the development of more severe conditions, including possibly chronic otitis media or similar infections in the ear canal that can cause the described symptoms.
Answer: (E) Elevated HBA1c

Question: A 2-year-old male is brought to his pediatrician by his mother because of abdominal pain and blood in the stool. Scintigraphy reveals uptake in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen. Persistence of which of the following structures is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms? (E) Ureteric bud (C) Paramesonephric duct (B) Omphalomesenteric duct (D) Allantois (A) Urachus
Reason: The symptoms presented by the 2-year-old boy, including abdominal pain and blood in the stool, along with the scintigraphy findings of uptake in the right lower quadrant, suggest a gastrointestinal issue stemming from an embryonic structure. The persistence of the omphalomesenteric duct, which normally degenerates during fetal development, can lead to complications such as meckel diverticulum, potentially causing symptoms like abdominal pain and gastrointestinal bleeding, which aligns with the patient's clinical presentation.
Answer: (B) Omphalomesenteric duct

Question: Following a motor vehicle accident, a 63-year-old man is scheduled for surgery. The emergency physician notes a posture abnormality in the distal left lower limb and a fracture-dislocation of the right hip and acetabulum based on the radiology report. The senior orthopedic resident mistakenly notes a fraction dislocation of the left hip and marks the left hip as the site of surgery. The examination by the surgeon in the operating room shows an externally rotated and shortened left lower limb. The surgeon inserts a pin in the left tibia but erroneously operates on the left hip. A review of postoperative imaging leads to a second surgery on the fracture-dislocation of the right hip. Rather than the surgeon alone, the surgical team and the hospital system are held accountable for not implementing the mandatory protocol of preincision ‘time-out’ and compliance monitoring. Which of the following best describes this approach to prevent medical errors? (B) Primordial prevention (E) Sentinel event (C) Root cause analysis (D) Swiss-cheese model (A) Closed-loop communication
Reason: The Swiss-cheese model describes how multiple layers of defense can fail, allowing a medical error to occur when all the holes in these layers align, leading to an adverse event. In this scenario, the lack of a time-out protocol represents a failure in the defense layers of patient safety, resulting in a significant error during surgery and a subsequent need for corrective action.
Answer: (D) Swiss-cheese model

Question: A 26-year-old woman comes to the emergency room because she had difficulty breathing during an exercise session. She also has a cough and end-expiratory wheezing. Besides these symptoms, she has a normal physical appearance. She has experienced similar breathing problems during exercise in the past, but never during rest. She is afebrile. What is the best treatment in this case? (A) Systemic corticosteroids (D) No therapy, only avoidance of exercise (E) Long acting β2-agonists (C) Aminophylline (B) Short acting β2-agonists
Reason: Short-acting β2-agonists are considered the first-line treatment for acute bronchospasm and exercise-induced asthma, providing quick relief of symptoms such as wheezing and difficulty breathing. In this case, the patient's symptoms occur during exercise, making a short-acting β2-agonist an appropriate choice to alleviate her acute respiratory distress.
Answer: (B) Short acting β2-agonists

Question: A 24-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with severe abdominal and lower back pain. She describes it as intense cramping and states that she experienced severe pain roughly 1 month ago that was similar. The patient's past medical history is non-contributory, and she states that her menses cause her to soak through 1 pad in a day. She is currently sexually active and does not use any contraception. Her vitals are within normal limits. The patient's abdominal exam is non-focal, and her pelvic exam reveals no adnexal masses or tenderness and no cervical motion tenderness. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? (E) Primary dysmenorrhea (B) Appendicitis (D) Leiomyoma (A) Adenomyosis (C) Ectopic pregnancy
Reason: Primary dysmenorrhea is characterized by recurrent abdominal cramps associated with menstruation, typically occurring in young women without any underlying pathology. Given the patient's pattern of severe cramping pain that coincides with her menstrual cycle and the absence of physical exam findings suggesting other potential causes like ectopic pregnancy or appendicitis, primary dysmenorrhea is the most plausible diagnosis.
Answer: (E) Primary dysmenorrhea

Question: A 26-year-old woman comes to the emergency department with fever, abdominal pain, and nausea for the past 7 hours. The pain started in the right lower abdomen but has now progressed to diffuse abdominal pain. Her temperature is 39.5°C (103.1°F). Physical examination shows generalized abdominal tenderness with rebound, guarding, and decreased bowel sounds. She is taken for an emergency exploratory laparoscopy, which shows a perforated appendix with an adjacent abscess and peritoneal inflammation. Cultures from the abscess fluid grow catalase-producing, anaerobic, gram-negative rods that have the ability to grow in bile. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient? (C) Cefazolin and doxycycline (D) Ampicillin and sulbactam (E) Aztreonam (A) Vancomycin and azithromycin (B) Piperacillin
Reason: The most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient is (D) Ampicillin and sulbactam because the patient's presentation suggests polymicrobial infection, typically seen in cases of perforated appendicitis with abscess formation. Ampicillin and sulbactam provide broad-spectrum coverage, including gram-negative rods, anaerobes, and can effectively target the type of bacteria likely involved in this complicated intra-abdominal infection.
Answer: (D) Ampicillin and sulbactam

Question: A newborn male is evaluated in the hospital nursery two hours after birth. The patient was born at 39 weeks of gestation to a 30-year-old primigravid via vaginal delivery. The patient’s mother received routine prenatal care, and the pregnancy was uncomplicated. The patient’s anatomy ultrasound at 20 weeks of gestation was unremarkable. The patient’s mother denies any family history of genetic diseases. The patient’s Apgar scores were notable for poor muscle tone at both one and five minutes of life. The patient’s birth weight is 2.6 kg (5 lb 11 oz), which is at the 5th percentile. His height and head circumference are in the 15th and 3rd percentile, respectively. On physical exam, the patient has a wide nasal bridge, downslanting palpebral fissures, and widely spaced eyes. He has good respiratory effort with a high-pitched cry. This patient is most likely to have experienced a deletion on which of the following chromosomes? (A) 4p (D) 7q (C) 5q (E) 15q (B) 5p
Reason: The patient is most likely to have a deletion on chromosome 5p, consistent with Cri du Chat syndrome, which is characterized by a distinctive high-pitched cry, dysmorphic features including a wide nasal bridge and downslanting palpebral fissures, and growth restriction. The combination of the patient's physical findings and developmental delays strongly suggests this genetic condition associated with a deletion in the short arm of chromosome 5.
Answer: (B) 5p

Question: Several years after a teenage boy and his younger brother witnessed a gang related murder, they both decided to come forward and report it to authorities. The older brother describes the horrific decapitation of the gang member without displaying any emotion; but when the younger brother was asked about the crime, he had no recollection of the event. Which two ego defenses are being displayed by these brothers, respectively? (E) Suppression; Repression (D) Splitting; Regression (C) Denial; Dissociation (A) Isolation of affect; Repression (B) Isolation of affect; Displacement
Reason: The older brother is displaying isolation of affect, as he recounts the traumatic event without exhibiting any emotions, indicating a disconnection between his thoughts and feelings about the incident. The younger brother's lack of recollection of the event suggests repression, where traumatic memories are unconsciously blocked from conscious awareness in response to the anxiety associated with them.
Answer: (A) Isolation of affect; Repression

Question: A 45-year-old man presents to the physician with complaints of burning pain in both feet and lower legs for 3 months. He reports that the pain is especially severe at night. He has a history of diabetes mellitus for the past 5 years, and he frequently skips his oral antidiabetic medications. His temperature is 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate is 80/min, respiratory rate is 15/min, and blood pressure is 120/80 mm Hg. His weight is 70 kg (154.3 lb) and height is 165 cm (approx. 5 ft 5 in). The neurologic examination reveals loss of sensations of pain and temperature over the dorsal and ventral sides of the feet and over the distal one-third of both legs. Proprioception is normal; knee jerks and ankle reflexes are also normal. The tone and strength in all muscles are normal. The hemoglobin A1C is 7.8%. Involvement of what type of nerve fibers is the most likely cause of the patient’s symptoms? (E) Aγ & C fibers (D) Aδ & C fibers (C) Aγ & B fibers (A) Aα & Aβ fibers (B) Aβ & Aγ fibers
Reason: The correct answer is (D) Aδ & C fibers because the patient presents with burning pain and loss of pain and temperature sensation, which suggests that small nerve fibers (C fibers) and thinly myelinated fibers (Aδ fibers) are primarily affected. This pattern is commonly observed in diabetic neuropathy, where these specific nerve fibers are often compromised, leading to the described sensory deficits.
Answer: (D) Aδ & C fibers

Question: A 36-year-old primigravid woman at 15 weeks' gestation comes to the physician for a routine prenatal visit. She has not been taking prenatal vitamins and admits to consuming alcohol regularly. Pelvic examination shows a uterus consistent in size with a 15-week gestation. A quadruple screening test shows markedly elevated maternal serum α-fetoprotein. Maternal serum concentrations of β-human chorionic gonadotropin, estriol, and inhibin A are normal. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for these findings? (A) Fetal alcohol syndrome (D) Spina bifida cystica (E) Trisomy 18 (B) Trisomy 21 (C) Holoprosencephaly
Reason: The correct answer is (D) Spina bifida cystica, as the markedly elevated maternal serum α-fetoprotein (AFP) is often associated with neural tube defects, including spina bifida. In this case, the normal levels of β-human chorionic gonadotropin, estriol, and inhibin A further support that the elevation in AFP is due to a fetal condition rather than an abnormality in the pregnancy itself.
Answer: (D) Spina bifida cystica

Question: A 33-year-old woman comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. She has a history of Crohn disease, for which she takes methotrexate. She and her husband would like to start trying to have a child. Because of the teratogenicity of methotrexate, the physician switches the patient from methotrexate to a purine analog drug that inhibits lymphocyte proliferation by blocking nucleotide synthesis. Toxicity of the newly prescribed purine analog would most likely increase if the patient was also being treated with which of the following medications? (A) Febuxostat (D) Hydroxyurea (B) Pemetrexed (C) Rasburicase (E) Cyclosporine
Reason: The correct answer is (A) Febuxostat, because it is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor that can lead to increased levels of uric acid in the presence of a purine analog, like mercaptopurine or azathioprine. Since purine analogs interfere with nucleotide synthesis and their elimination is dependent on xanthine oxidase, the combination with febuxostat can potentiate the toxicity of the purine analog by reducing its metabolism and increasing its systemic concentration.
Answer: (A) Febuxostat
[INFO] Sampling path 10 completed.
[INFO] Opinion paths:
Path 1: Let's analyze the situation step by step.

1. **Patient Background**: The patient is a 42-year-old man with type 1 diabetes mellitus who is on insulin. He experiences hypoglycemic symptoms (excessive sweating, hand tremors, and weakness) during the night, leading to waking up in distress.

2. **Symptoms Interpretation**: The symptoms described (waking up with sweating, tremors, and weakness) suggest that the patient is experiencing nocturnal hypoglycemia, which is common in individuals with diabetes who are on insulin.

3. **Morning Blood Glucose**: The patient reports high morning blood glucose levels, which indicates that he may be experiencing hypoglycemia during the night followed by a rebound hyperglycemia, a phenomenon known as the Somogyi effect.

4. **Optimal Intervention**: In cases of nocturnal hypoglycemia, the appropriate intervention is typically to reduce the insulin dose, particularly if the patient is experiencing hypoglycemic episodes at night. This approach helps to prevent further episodes of hypoglycemia.

Given this reasoning, the correct answer is:
**(E) Reducing daily insulin dose**
Path 2: Let's analyze the situation step by step. The patient has type 1 diabetes mellitus and is experiencing nocturnal hypoglycemia, as indicated by the symptoms of sweating, hand tremors, and weakness upon waking. These symptoms suggest that he is likely experiencing low blood sugar levels during the night, which is causing him to wake up.

Given that his morning blood glucose is high, it is possible that he is having hypoglycemia during the night that leads to a counter-regulatory response, resulting in elevated blood glucose levels by morning due to gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis after the episode of hypoglycemia.

The optimal intervention in this case would not be to increase or reduce the daily insulin dose without assessing the timing and amount of insulin he is taking in the evenings, as this could exacerbate the hypoglycemic episodes. Instead, the best approach would be to reduce the daily insulin dose, especially if he is experiencing nocturnal hypoglycemia.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
(E) Reducing daily insulin dose
Path 3: Let's analyze the patient's symptoms and situation step by step. 

1. The patient has type 1 diabetes mellitus and is experiencing episodes of waking up in the middle of the night with symptoms of excessive sweating, hand tremors, and weakness. These symptoms are suggestive of hypoglycemia, which can occur during the night, leading to what is often referred to as "nocturnal hypoglycemia."

2. Despite the episodes of hypoglycemia during the night, the patient reports high morning blood glucose levels on repeated measurement. This phenomenon can occur if the patient experiences hypoglycemia at night, which triggers a counter-regulatory hormonal response (like glucagon and epinephrine), leading to increased glucose production by the liver and resulting in high blood glucose levels in the morning (known as the "Somogyi effect").

3. Given these considerations, the optimal intervention would be to reduce the daily insulin dose to prevent nocturnal hypoglycemia while still maintaining overall glucose control.

Therefore, the correct answer is: 
(E) Reducing daily insulin dose.
Path 4: Let's analyze the situation step by step.

1. **Patient Profile**: The patient is a 42-year-old man with type 1 diabetes mellitus who is currently taking insulin.

2. **Symptoms**: He experiences episodes of waking up in the middle of the night with excessive sweating, hand tremors, and weakness, which are classic signs of hypoglycemia.

3. **Morning Blood Glucose**: His morning blood glucose is high on repeated measurements, which suggests he may be experiencing nocturnal hypoglycemia leading to counter-regulatory hormone release that causes hyperglycemia in the morning (the "Somogyi effect").

4. **Optimal Intervention**: Given that he is experiencing symptoms of hypoglycemia at night, the most appropriate intervention would be to reduce the daily insulin dose to prevent these episodes. Increasing the dose would likely exacerbate the problem.

Therefore, the answer is:
(E) Reducing daily insulin dose.
Path 5: Let's think through this step by step.

The patient is experiencing symptoms consistent with hypoglycemia during the night, which are the excessive sweating, hand tremors, and weakness upon waking. Despite these symptoms, he has high morning blood glucose levels, suggesting that he may be experiencing nocturnal hypoglycemia followed by a rebound hyperglycemia (the Somogyi effect).

Given this context, the optimal intervention would be to avoid further episodes of hypoglycemia. The symptoms indicate that he may be receiving too much insulin, particularly if he is experiencing frequent nighttime hypoglycemia. Therefore, the most appropriate action would be to reduce the daily insulin dose to prevent these nighttime hypoglycemic episodes.

Answer: (E) Reducing daily insulin dose
Path 6: Let's analyze the scenario step by step. The 42-year-old man with type 1 diabetes is experiencing episodes of waking up in the middle of the night with symptoms consistent with hypoglycemia, such as excessive sweating, hand tremors, and weakness. However, he also has high morning blood glucose readings. 

This suggests that he may be experiencing nocturnal hypoglycemia, which can lead to the release of counter-regulatory hormones and result in high blood glucose levels upon waking, a phenomenon known as the "Somogyi effect" or "rebound hyperglycemia."

In this context, the optimal intervention would be to reduce the risk of nocturnal hypoglycemia while managing his overall blood glucose levels. The most appropriate option in this case would be to reduce the daily insulin dose, as excessive insulin could be contributing to the nighttime hypoglycemia.

Answer: (E) Reducing daily insulin dose.
Path 7: Let's think this through step by step.

The 42-year-old man with type 1 diabetes mellitus is experiencing symptoms that suggest nocturnal hypoglycemia. The excessive sweating, hand tremors, and weakness upon waking indicate that he may be having low blood sugar levels during the night. This can lead to the high morning blood glucose levels he is experiencing due to the "dawn phenomenon" or rebound hyperglycemia after a hypoglycemic episode.

Given these symptoms, the optimal intervention would not be to increase his insulin dose, as this could exacerbate the episodes of hypoglycemia. Instead, it would be more appropriate to reduce the daily insulin dose to prevent these nighttime hypoglycemic events.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(E) Reducing daily insulin dose
Path 8: Let's analyze the case step by step. 

The patient has type 1 diabetes mellitus and is experiencing symptoms suggestive of hypoglycemia during the night, such as sweating, hand tremors, and weakness. These symptoms typically indicate that he may be experiencing nocturnal hypoglycemia, which can lead to elevated blood glucose levels in the morning due to the body's counter-regulatory response (like the release of glucagon and epinephrine).

In this case, the high morning blood glucose levels can be attributed to the body's response to the hypoglycemic episodes during the night. To address the issue of nighttime hypoglycemia, the most appropriate intervention would be to reduce the daily insulin dose to prevent these episodes.

Therefore, the optimal intervention for this patient condition is:
**(E) Reducing daily insulin dose.**
Path 9: Let's analyze the situation step by step.

The patient has type 1 diabetes and is experiencing nocturnal hypoglycemia, as evidenced by his symptoms of sweating, hand tremors, and weakness upon waking. These symptoms suggest that his blood glucose levels drop significantly during the night, leading to hypoglycemia, which then causes rebound hyperglycemia in the morning (often referred to as the Somogyi effect).

Given that he has frequent episodes of nocturnal hypoglycemia, the optimal intervention would not be to increase his insulin dose, which would potentially exacerbate his hypoglycemic episodes. Instead, the most appropriate action would be to reduce his daily insulin dose to help prevent these nocturnal lows.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
(E) Reducing daily insulin dose.
Path 10: Let's analyze the situation step by step.

1. **Patient's Condition**: The patient has type 1 diabetes mellitus and experiences hypoglycemic symptoms during the night (excessive sweating, hand tremors, weakness). These symptoms suggest that he is likely experiencing nocturnal hypoglycemia.

2. **Morning Blood Glucose**: The patient also has high morning blood glucose levels. This could indicate the "Somogyi effect," where a rebound hyperglycemia occurs due to the body’s counterregulatory response to previous hypoglycemia.

3. **Management Options**:
   - **(D) Increasing daily insulin dose**: This could worsen hypoglycemia and is not an appropriate intervention given the nocturnal symptoms.
   - **(C) Adding pramlintide**: This is an amylin analog that can help control postprandial glucose levels, but it does not address the nocturnal hypoglycemia.
   - **(A) Reassurance**: While reassurance is important, it does not address the underlying issue of hypoglycemia.
   - **(B) Adding diazepam**: This does not address the blood glucose issue and is not relevant for diabetes management.
   - **(E) Reducing daily insulin dose**: This option is the most appropriate, as reducing the insulin dose may help prevent nocturnal hypoglycemia and stabilize morning blood glucose levels.

Based on this analysis, the optimal intervention for this patient condition is: 

**Answer: (E) Reducing daily insulin dose.**
[INFO] Final decision by majority voting
After reviewing the 10 different reasoning paths, it is clear that all paths consistently arrive at the same conclusion regarding the optimal intervention for the patient experiencing nocturnal hypoglycemia. Each path identifies the symptoms and the potential cause (the Somogyi effect) and recommends reducing the daily insulin dose as the most appropriate action to prevent further episodes of hypoglycemia.

The majority voting results are as follows:
- Path 1: (E) Reducing daily insulin dose
- Path 2: (E) Reducing daily insulin dose
- Path 3: (E) Reducing daily insulin dose
- Path 4: (E) Reducing daily insulin dose
- Path 5: (E) Reducing daily insulin dose
- Path 6: (E) Reducing daily insulin dose
- Path 7: (E) Reducing daily insulin dose
- Path 8: (E) Reducing daily insulin dose
- Path 9: (E) Reducing daily insulin dose
- Path 10: (E) Reducing daily insulin dose

All 10 paths unanimously support the answer:
**(E) Reducing daily insulin dose.**

Therefore, the final decision is:
**Reducing daily insulin dose.**
