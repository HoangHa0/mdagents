[INFO] Final decision: {0.0: "Let's think through the scenario step by step. \n\nThe patient is a 12-year-old boy with a spontaneous nosebleed (epistaxis) from the left nostril, which is persistent and has not been seen before. He is currently applying pressure to the left nostril and has no significant past medical or family history of bleeding disorders. \n\nIn cases of anterior epistaxis, the initial management typically involves conservative measures. The most appropriate initial therapy for a nosebleed is to apply direct pressure. This is usually done by pinching the nostrils together and leaning forward to prevent blood from flowing down the throat. \n\nGiven the options provided, the best choice for initial therapy is:\n\n(E) Squeezing the nostrils manually for 10 minutes with the head elevated.\n\nThis method is effective in controlling most cases of anterior epistaxis and is the first-line approach before considering other interventions like cauterization or packing."}
