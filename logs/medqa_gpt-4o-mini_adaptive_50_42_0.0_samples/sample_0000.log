[INFO] Final decision: {0.0: "Let's analyze the case step by step.\n\n1. **Travel History**: The patient recently returned from a 2-week vacation in Vietnam and Cambodia, which are regions where certain viral infections are endemic.\n\n2. **Symptoms**: The patient presents with:\n   - Fatigue\n   - Worsening headache\n   - Malaise\n   - Pain in hands and wrists (suggestive of arthralgia)\n   - Fever (102.5°F)\n   - Maculopapular rash on trunk and upper thighs\n   - Tenderness over bilateral metacarpophalangeal joints\n\n3. **Laboratory Findings**:\n   - Leukopenia (low white blood cell count: 3,200/mm^3)\n   - Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count: 112,000/mm^3)\n   - Elevated liver enzymes (AST: 106 U/L, ALT: 112 U/L)\n\n4. **Differential Diagnosis**:\n   - **Dengue Fever**: Common in Southeast Asia, presents with fever, headache, retro-orbital pain, arthralgia, rash, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. The patient's symptoms and lab findings align well with dengue fever.\n   - **Chikungunya**: Also presents with fever and severe joint pain, but typically has a more pronounced arthralgia component and may not always show significant liver enzyme elevation.\n   - **Hepatitis A**: Would typically present with jaundice and more significant liver enzyme elevation, and the travel history aligns, but the overall symptom profile is less consistent.\n   - **Epstein-Barr Virus**: Typically presents with fatigue, fever, and lymphadenopathy, not usually with the acute joint pain and rash seen here.\n   - **Typhoid Fever**: Would present with prolonged fever, abdominal symptoms, and possibly a rash, but the joint pain and lab findings are not typical.\n\nGiven the travel history, clinical presentation, and laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is:\n\n**Answer: (B) Dengue fever**."}
