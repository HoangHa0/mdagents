[INFO] Step 1. Expert Recruitment
Agent 1 (👨🏿‍⚕️ Cardiologist): Focuses on the diagnosis and treatment of heart and blood vessel-related conditions, including hypertension management.
Agent 2 (👨🏽‍⚕️ Endocrinologist): Specializes in diabetes management and its complications, providing insight into the patient's overall hormonal health and any related effects on blood pressure.
Agent 3 (👩🏻‍⚕️ Pharmacologist): Expert in the effects and mechanisms of drugs, particularly in relation to antihypertensive medications and their side effects, including edema.

[INFO] Step 2. Initial Opinions
 Agent 1 (👨🏿‍⚕️ cardiologist) : In this scenario, the patient is experiencing new onset lower extremity swelling after a recent addition of an antihypertensive medication. Among the options provided, the medications that are commonly associated with peripheral edema include:

- (C) Nifedipine, which is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker that is known to cause peripheral edema as a side effect due to its vasodilatory effects.
- (E) Spironolactone, which is a potassium-sparing diuretic and can cause lower extremity swelling but is less commonly associated with edema compared to calcium channel blockers.

Given the context of this case, the medication likely prescribed, resulting in the new onset swelling, is (C) Nifedipine.
 Agent 2 (👨🏽‍⚕️ endocrinologist) : The new onset of lower extremity swelling in this patient suggests the development of peripheral edema, which is a common side effect associated with certain antihypertensive medications. 

Among the options provided, the following are considerations:

(A) **Metoprolol** - A beta-blocker that usually does not cause peripheral edema as a side effect.

(B) **Verapamil** - A calcium channel blocker that can cause peripheral edema, but it is less commonly prescribed as a first-line agent for hypertension compared to diuretics.

(C) **Nifedipine** - A dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker that is well-known for causing peripheral edema due to vasodilation.

(D) **Hydrochlorthiazide** - A thiazide diuretic, which is often used to treat hypertension and does not typically cause swelling; it may reduce swelling as it helps to eliminate excess fluid.

(E) **Spironolactone** - An aldosterone antagonist that can also be utilized in hypertension management and can cause hyperkalemia, but not typically associated with peripheral edema. 

Given the acute development of lower extremity swelling after starting a new antihypertensive medication, the most likely prescribed medication is **(C) Nifedipine**, as peripheral edema is a well-known side effect of dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers.
 Agent 3 (👩🏻‍⚕️ pharmacologist) : In this clinical scenario, the addition of a new antihypertensive medication that leads to lower extremity swelling suggests a medication known for causing peripheral edema as a side effect. Among the listed options, the one most commonly associated with causing edema is:

(C) Nifedipine - This medication is a calcium channel blocker which is known to cause peripheral edema, especially in the lower extremities. This can occur due to vasodilation and the resultant fluid retention in the tissues.

The other options generally have different side effect profiles:

(A) Metoprolol - This is a beta-blocker and is less likely to cause peripheral edema. It may lead to other side effects including fatigue and bradycardia.

(B) Verapamil - Although this is also a calcium channel blocker, it is less commonly associated with peripheral edema compared to dihydropyridine-type calcium channel blockers like nifedipine.

(D) Hydrochlorothiazide - A thiazide diuretic that would typically reduce fluid retention and is not known to cause edema.

(E) Spironolactone - This is a potassium-sparing diuretic; while it can cause some fluid retention in certain contexts, it generally helps with edema rather than causing it.

In conclusion, based on the information provided and the common side effects associated with these medications, the most likely prescribed medication that led to the new onset of lower extremity swelling is (C) Nifedipine.

[INFO] Step 4. Final Decision
👨‍⚖️  Moderator's final decision: {0.0: 'Based on the multidisciplinary team discussion, there is a clear consensus among the experts regarding the likely medication prescribed to the patient that resulted in new onset lower extremity swelling. \n\nAll experts identified (C) Nifedipine as the most probable cause of the swelling due to its well-known side effect of peripheral edema, particularly in the context of a patient who has recently started a new antihypertensive medication. The other options were discussed, and while some could potentially cause edema, they are either less commonly associated with this side effect or are not typically prescribed in this scenario.\n\nGiven the reasoning provided by the cardiologist, endocrinologist, and pharmacologist, the final decision is:\n\n**Answer: (C) Nifedipine**'}
