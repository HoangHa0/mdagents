[INFO] Step 1. Expert Recruitment
Agent 1 (👨🏽‍⚕️ Pediatrician): Specializes in the medical care of infants, children, and adolescents, particularly in the assessment of menstrual irregularities and developmental issues.
Agent 2 (🧑🏿‍⚕️ Endocrinologist): Focuses on hormonal disorders, which can include conditions affecting menstrual cycles and metabolic issues, like insulin resistance or diabetes.
Agent 3 (👨🏿‍⚕️ Psychologist): Specializes in mental health, particularly in relation to stress, eating disorders, and the psychological aspects of binge eating.

[INFO] Step 2. Initial Opinions
 Agent 1 (👨🏽‍⚕️ pediatrician) : In this case, the 17-year-old woman is presenting with signs suggestive of an eating disorder, specifically binge eating, as well as amenorrhea (absence of menstruation). The physical exam findings of enlarged cheeks and calluses on the dorsum of her hands also suggest that she may have been engaging in purging behaviors such as self-induced vomiting. In patients with bulimia nervosa, which can include binge eating followed by compensatory behaviors, erosion of tooth enamel is a common finding due to the acid exposure from frequent vomiting.

Therefore, the most expected finding in this patient, given the context of binge eating and the potential for purging, would be:

(C) Erosion of tooth enamel.
 Agent 2 (🧑🏿‍⚕️ endocrinologist) : Based on the information provided, this 17-year-old woman's symptoms and presentation are suggestive of binge eating disorder, which can lead to insulin resistance and other metabolic issues. The physical exam findings such as enlarged cheeks (which may indicate parotid gland enlargement due to frequent vomiting or chewing food in the case of bulimia) and calluses on the dorsum of her hands (possibly due to calluses from inducing vomiting or frequent contact with food) point towards potential metabolic consequences of her eating pattern.

Among the options provided, the most fitting additional finding expected in this patient would be (C) Erosion of tooth enamel. This occurs often in patients who engage in binge eating or purging behaviors, due to the exposure of teeth to acidic contents from the stomach. The other options, such as increased blood glucose level, malar rash, enlarged thyroid, and elevated estrogen levels, do not correlate as well with her symptoms and recent behaviors. 

Therefore, the expected finding in this situation is (C) Erosion of tooth enamel.
 Agent 3 (👨🏿‍⚕️ psychologist) : In this case, the 17-year-old woman presents with symptoms that suggest binge eating behavior, which can be associated with challenges such as stress, and it seems likely that she may be experiencing some psychological aspects of this condition. Given her clinical findings—enlarged cheeks and calluses on the hands (indicating possible self-induced vomiting due to binge eating), and the absence of menstruation (amenorrhea)—we would expect to see additional physiological effects of her eating behaviors.

The calluses on the dorsum of her hands are suggestive of using them to induce vomiting (often referred to as Russell's sign), a behavior commonly associated with bulimia nervosa. One common consequence of recurrent vomiting is erosion of tooth enamel due to the exposure of teeth to stomach acid. 

Therefore, the expected finding in this patient, given her symptoms and behavior patterns, would be:

(C) Erosion of tooth enamel.

[INFO] Step 4. Final Decision
👨‍⚖️  Moderator's final decision: {0.0: "Based on the multidisciplinary team discussion, there is a clear consensus among the experts regarding the expected finding in this 17-year-old woman who presents with symptoms suggestive of binge eating and potential purging behaviors. All experts—pediatrician, endocrinologist, and psychologist—have identified erosion of tooth enamel as the most likely additional finding due to the exposure of teeth to stomach acid from frequent vomiting, which is commonly associated with bulimia nervosa.\n\nThe reasoning provided by each expert highlights the connection between the patient's symptoms (enlarged cheeks, calluses on the hands, and amenorrhea) and the physiological consequences of her eating behaviors. The other options presented (increased blood glucose level, malar rash, enlarged thyroid, elevated estrogen levels) do not align as closely with the clinical picture.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the question is:\n\n(C) Erosion of tooth enamel."}
