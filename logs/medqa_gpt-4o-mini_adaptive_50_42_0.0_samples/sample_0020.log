[INFO] Final decision: {0.0: "Let's think step by step. \n\nThe patient is being prescribed high-dose niacin (vitamin B3) for hypertriglyceridemia. One of the common side effects of niacin is flushing, which is often accompanied by itching and a sensation of warmth. This flushing is primarily caused by the release of prostaglandins, which are mediators that cause vasodilation and increased blood flow to the skin.\n\nTo prevent this flushing effect, physicians often recommend taking aspirin before administering niacin, as aspirin can inhibit the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes that are responsible for the production of prostaglandins.\n\nGiven this information, the mechanism that the physician is trying to avoid by recommending aspirin is:\n\n(C) Release of prostaglandins.\n\nSo, the answer is (C) Release of prostaglandins."}
