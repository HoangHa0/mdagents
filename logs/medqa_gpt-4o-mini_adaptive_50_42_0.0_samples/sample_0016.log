[INFO] Final decision: {0.0: "Let's analyze the situation step by step. The patient is experiencing a whistling noise when breathing through her nose three months after a rhinoplasty procedure. This symptom suggests that there is an abnormal airflow pattern in the nasal passages.\n\n1. **Post-operative swelling (A)**: While swelling can occur after surgery, it typically resolves within a few weeks, and three months post-op would likely not result in a whistling noise.\n\n2. **A fracture of the bony septum (E)**: A fracture could potentially cause issues, but it would more likely lead to obstruction or other symptoms rather than a whistling noise.\n\n3. **A deviated septum that is now straight, resulting in altered nasal airflow (C)**: If the septum was previously deviated and is now straightened, it could change airflow dynamics, but it would not typically cause a whistling noise.\n\n4. **Excessive columellar show resulting in increased nasal airflow (D)**: This could potentially alter airflow, but it is less likely to be the direct cause of a whistling noise.\n\n5. **A septal hematoma causing a perforation (B)**: A septal hematoma can lead to a perforation in the septum, which can create an abnormal airflow pattern and result in a whistling sound during respiration.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most likely cause of the whistling noise in this patient is:\n\n**Answer: (B) A septal hematoma causing a perforation.**"}
